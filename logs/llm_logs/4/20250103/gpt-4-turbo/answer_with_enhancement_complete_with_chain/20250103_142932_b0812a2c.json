Mannitol\nopb. Spironolactone\nopc. Furosemide\nopd. Hydrochlorothiazide\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nMannitol, an osmotic diuretic, increases intravascular volume which can exacerbate cardiac workload, making it contraindicated in patients with cardiac failure. This aligns with the standard medical consensus that in the presence of cardiac failure, treatments that increase cardiac workload are to be avoided. The evidence path confirming Mannitol as an osmotic diuretic supports this reasoning. In contrast, Spironolactone and Furosemide are not contraindicated in cardiac failure; Spironolactone is a potassium-sparing diuretic that helps manage fluid overload by reducing aldosterone effects, and Furosemide, a loop diuretic, effectively reduces blood volume and cardiac preload, both beneficial in cardiac failure management. Hydrochlorothiazide, a thiazide diuretic, although less potent in severe heart failure, is not typically contraindicated unless specific complications arise. The evidence paths for these medications confirm their classifications and general mechanisms of action but do not alter the consensus on their use in cardiac failure.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The primary medical principle in question here is the management of cardiac failure with appropriate diuretics that do not exacerbate the patient's condition. Mannitol, an osmotic diuretic, is known to increase intravascular volume, which can lead to an increased workload on the heart. This is particularly detrimental in patients with cardiac failure, where managing fluid balance without overburdening the heart is crucial. Spironolactone and Furosemide are both beneficial in cardiac failure due to their mechanisms that help reduce fluid overload and cardiac stress. Hydrochlorothiazide, while less potent, is not contraindicated unless specific complications are present. Therefore, based on the consensus and the mechanisms of action of these diuretics, Mannitol is the most likely to be contraindicated in the presence of cardiac failure due to its potential to increase cardiac workload.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
