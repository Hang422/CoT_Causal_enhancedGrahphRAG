Thiothixanthene\nopb. Phenothiazine\nopc. Butyrophenone\nopd. Diphenyl butyl piperidine\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nPimozide is a diphenyl butyl piperidine, used primarily for treating Tourette's syndrome and schizophrenia. Its classification is based on its unique chemical structure and pharmacological action, distinct from other antipsychotic classes such as phenothiazines, thiothixenes, and butyrophenones.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "### Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\n1. **Classification of Pimozide**: Pimozide is an antipsychotic medication used primarily for the treatment of Tourette's syndrome and certain types of schizophrenia. The classification of antipsychotic drugs is typically based on their chemical structure and pharmacological properties.\n\n2. **Analyzing the Options**:\n   - **opa. Thiothixene**: Thiothixenes are a class of typical antipsychotics, chemically related to the phenothiazines but with a different structure.\n   - **opb. Phenothiazine**: Phenothiazines are another class of antipsychotics, known for drugs like chlorpromazine. They have a distinct three-ring chemical structure.\n   - **opc. Butyrophenone**: This class includes drugs like haloperidol, known for their use in treating schizophrenia and acute psychotic states.\n   - **opd. Diphenyl butyl piperidine**: This class includes drugs like pimozide itself, characterized by a specific chemical structure that differentiates it from other antipsychotics.\n\n3. **Enhanced Information Confirmation**: The enhanced information provided confirms that pimozide is classified as a diphenyl butyl piperidine. This aligns with standard pharmacological classifications where pimozide is distinguished by its unique structure and mechanism of action, separate from the other listed classes.\n\n4. **Medical Consensus and Literature Support**: Standard medical references and pharmacology textbooks support the classification of pimozide as a diphenyl butyl piperidine. This is consistent with its chemical structure and the specific pharmacological action it exhibits, particularly in the treatment of Tourette's syndrome.\n\n### Final Analysis\nBased on the standard medical knowledge and the enhanced information provided, pimozide is best classified as a diphenyl butyl piperidine. This classification is supported by both the chemical structure of pimozide and its recognized pharmacological effects in clinical settings. The other options represent different classes of antipsychotics with distinct chemical and pharmacological profiles that do not match pimozide.\n\nGiven the clear alignment between standard references and the enhanced information, there is high confidence in this classification.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Pimozide is classified as a diphenyl butyl piperidine, based on its chemical structure and specific pharmacological actions. This classification is well-supported by standard medical references and aligns with the enhanced information provided.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
