Osteoporosis\nopb. Endometrial hyperplasia\nopc. Ovarian cancer\nopd. Decreased triglyceride level\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nTamoxifen, a selective estrogen receptor modulator, primarily increases the risk of endometrial hyperplasia due to its estrogenic effects in the uterus. It does not significantly affect ovarian cancer risk, does not typically lead to osteoporosis, and is known to potentially increase, not decrease, triglyceride levels.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Tamoxifen is a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) that is commonly used in the treatment and prevention of breast cancer. While it acts as an antagonist on estrogen receptors in breast tissue, it can exhibit estrogen-like effects in other tissues. One of the well-documented effects of tamoxifen is its impact on the uterus. It can cause endometrial hyperplasia, which is an increase in the number of cells in the uterine lining. This condition is a known risk factor for developing endometrial cancer. The other options provided do not align as closely with the known effects of tamoxifen. Specifically, tamoxifen is not associated with a significant risk of ovarian cancer, it does not typically cause osteoporosis (in fact, it can have protective effects on bone density), and it tends to increase, rather than decrease, triglyceride levels. Therefore, based on the consensus in medical literature and the enhanced information provided, the most likely correct answer is that tamoxifen causes endometrial hyperplasia.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
