Striated\nopb. Large T tubules\nopc. Troponin system present\nopd. Caldesmon is impoant regulatory protein\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nCardiac muscle is striated and uses the troponin system for contraction, but has smaller T tubules compared to skeletal muscle. Caldesmon, primarily associated with smooth muscle, is not a significant regulatory protein in cardiac muscle, making option D ('Caldesmon is an important regulatory protein') the correct answer as it does not describe a feature of cardiac muscle.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "### Core Medical Principle:\nCardiac muscle, like skeletal muscle, is striated and utilizes the troponin system for contraction regulation. T tubules in cardiac muscle facilitate the propagation of action potentials into the cell, although they are generally smaller than those in skeletal muscle. Caldesmon, however, is predominantly associated with smooth muscle and not a significant regulatory protein in cardiac muscle.\n\n### Analysis:\n- **Option opa (Striated)**: Cardiac muscle is indeed striated, similar to skeletal muscle, which helps in the organization of sarcomeres and contributes to its contraction mechanism.\n- **Option opb (Large T tubules)**: While cardiac muscle does have T tubules, they are not typically described as large, especially when compared to those in skeletal muscle. However, the presence of T tubules themselves is a feature of cardiac muscle.\n- **Option opc (Troponin system present)**: The troponin system is a key regulatory mechanism in cardiac muscle contraction, similar to its role in skeletal muscle.\n- **Option opd (Caldesmon is an important regulatory protein)**: Caldesmon is more closely associated with smooth muscle and does not play a significant role in cardiac muscle regulation. This makes it the exception among the listed options.\n\n### Final Analysis:\nThe question asks for the feature that is NOT associated with cardiac muscle. Based on standard medical knowledge and the consensus in muscle physiology, Caldesmon's role as an important regulatory protein in cardiac muscle is not supported. Therefore, option D is the correct answer as it does not accurately describe a feature of cardiac muscle.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"After evaluating each option against the known characteristics of cardiac muscle, it is clear that Caldesmon, primarily linked with smooth muscle, does not serve as a significant regulatory protein in cardiac muscle. This aligns with the consensus in muscle physiology, making option D the correct choice.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
