Interleukin-6\nopb. Interleukin-6 receptor\nopc. Interleukin-5\nopd. Interleukin-5 receptor\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nTocilizumab is a monoclonal antibody that targets the interleukin-6 receptor (IL-6R), which is instrumental in managing the inflammation associated with rheumatoid arthritis. This targeting helps in blocking the pro-inflammatory effects of IL-6, a key cytokine in the disease's pathology. The reasoning chains and evidence paths confirm this target specificity, aligning well with medical consensus.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Tocilizumab is a monoclonal antibody used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. It specifically targets the interleukin-6 receptor (IL-6R), not interleukin-6 itself. By binding to IL-6R, tocilizumab inhibits the receptor's interaction with IL-6, thereby blocking the signal transduction pathway that leads to inflammation. This mechanism of action is well-documented in medical literature and aligns with the consensus in pharmacological management of rheumatoid arthritis. The options provided include both interleukin-6 and its receptor, but the correct target for tocilizumab is the interleukin-6 receptor, as supported by the enhanced information and standard medical knowledge.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
