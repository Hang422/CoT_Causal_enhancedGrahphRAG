Collecting duct\nopb. Glomerulus\nopc. Proximal convoluted tubule\nopd. Loop of Henle\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nAldosterone primarily acts at the collecting duct of the nephron, where it binds to mineralocorticoid receptors to increase sodium reabsorption and potassium excretion, crucial for maintaining blood pressure and electrolyte balance. This action is supported by evidence of aldosterone's interaction with mineralocorticoid receptors. Other nephron segments like the glomerulus, proximal convoluted tubule, and loop of Henle do not play significant roles in aldosterone's function.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Aldosterone is a hormone known for its role in regulating sodium and potassium levels in the body, which in turn affects blood pressure and fluid balance. It primarily functions by acting on the collecting ducts of the nephron in the kidneys. Here, aldosterone binds to mineralocorticoid receptors, leading to increased reabsorption of sodium into the bloodstream and increased excretion of potassium into the urine. This mechanism is well-documented and aligns with the standard physiological understanding of aldosterone's role in the renal system. The other options provided, such as the glomerulus, proximal convoluted tubule, and loop of Henle, do not significantly interact with aldosterone in terms of its primary function of sodium and potassium regulation. Therefore, based on medical consensus and the enhanced information provided, the collecting duct is the correct answer.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
