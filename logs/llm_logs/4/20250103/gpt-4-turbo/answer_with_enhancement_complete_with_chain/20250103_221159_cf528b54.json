Urine osmolality typically falls below 300 mmol/L, and in severe cases, it can be less than 150 mmol/L. Options suggesting higher osmolality values (such as <600 mmol/L or <900 mmol/L) are less typical and do not align closely with the biochemical presentation of the disease.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"In diabetes insipidus, the primary defect is either a lack of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) production or a resistance to its effects, leading to decreased water reabsorption in the kidneys. This results in the production of large volumes of dilute urine. The typical urine osmolality in diabetes insipidus is significantly low due to the inability to concentrate urine, generally falling below 300 mmol/L. In more severe cases, urine osmolality can drop below 150 mmol/L. The options provided suggest different thresholds for urine osmolality. Given the typical presentation of diabetes insipidus, urine osmolality less than 300 mmol/L (option opb) is a common finding and aligns with the medical consensus. However, in severe cases, it can be even lower, making option opa (<150 mmol/L) also a valid consideration but less typical for all cases. Therefore, the best-supported option that covers the broader scenario of diabetes insipidus, including both typical and severe cases, is <300 mmol/L.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
