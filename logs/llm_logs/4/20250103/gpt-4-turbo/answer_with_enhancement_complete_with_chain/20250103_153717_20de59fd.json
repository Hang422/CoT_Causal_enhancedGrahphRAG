Vitamin A\nopb. Vitamin K\nopc. Vitamin E\nopd. Vitamin D\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nVitamin K is identified as a coenzyme, functioning in the carboxylation of glutamic acid residues, which is essential for blood clotting and bone metabolism. This aligns with medical consensus that recognizes Vitamin K's coenzyme role in activating proteins involved in these processes. Other vitamins listed, such as Vitamin A, Vitamin E, and Vitamin D, do not function as coenzymes. Vitamin A is crucial for vision, immune function, and cell growth; Vitamin E acts primarily as an antioxidant protecting cell membranes; and Vitamin D regulates calcium and phosphate metabolism, promoting bone and immune health. The evidence paths provided do not directly support the coenzyme function of any vitamins but confirm the roles of Vitamin D and E in other biochemical processes.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The question requires identifying which of the listed fat-soluble vitamins functions as a coenzyme. Based on standard medical knowledge, Vitamin K is known to function as a coenzyme in the carboxylation of glutamic acid residues, a critical process for blood clotting and bone metabolism. This role is well-documented and aligns with the consensus in the medical and biochemical fields. The other vitamins listed have different primary functions: Vitamin A is important for vision and cellular growth, Vitamin E serves mainly as an antioxidant, and Vitamin D is crucial for calcium and phosphate metabolism. None of these vitamins are recognized primarily for functioning as coenzymes. Therefore, the most accurate answer, supported by both the consensus and the enhanced information provided, is Vitamin K.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
