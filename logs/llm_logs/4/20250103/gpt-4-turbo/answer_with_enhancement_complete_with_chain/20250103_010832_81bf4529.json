Patient gives history of recurrent bacterial infections. Ophthalmic examination reveals white triangular plaques on conjunctiva. This patient is suffering from deficiency of:\n\n                    ### Options\n                    opa. Vitamin D\nopb. Vitamin B\nopc. Vitamin A\nopd. Vitamin C\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nThe patient's symptoms of diminished night vision, dry eyes, and white triangular plaques on the conjunctiva, along with a history of recurrent bacterial infections, strongly suggest a deficiency of Vitamin A. Night blindness and xerophthalmia (dryness of the eyes) are classic symptoms of Vitamin A deficiency. The presence of Bitot's spots, the white plaques on the conjunctiva, further confirms this diagnosis, as these are specifically associated with Vitamin A deficiency. Vitamin A is also crucial for maintaining a healthy immune system, which aligns with the patient's history of recurrent infections. The evidence paths support these connections, particularly highlighting the direct cause of night blindness and xerophthalmia by Vitamin A deficiency. Other vitamins such as Vitamin D, B, and C, while important for overall health, do not directly cause the symptoms observed in this patient. Therefore, the patient is most likely suffering from Vitamin A deficiency.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The patient's symptoms of diminished night vision and dry eyes, along with the presence of white triangular plaques on the conjunctiva (Bitot's spots), are classic indicators of Vitamin A deficiency. Vitamin A is essential for the formation of rhodopsin, a pigment necessary for night vision, and its deficiency leads to night blindness. The dryness of the eyes, or xerophthalmia, and Bitot's spots are also directly linked to inadequate Vitamin A levels. Additionally, Vitamin A plays a crucial role in maintaining the integrity and function of skin and mucosal cells, including those in the immune system, which could explain the patient's history of recurrent bacterial infections. The symptoms presented do not typically align with deficiencies of Vitamins D, B, or C in such a direct manner. Based on these considerations and the alignment with medical consensus on the symptoms of Vitamin A deficiency, the diagnosis is confidently determined.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opc\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
