Bromocriptine\nopb. Levodopa\nopc. Amantadine\nopd. Metoclopramide\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nHyperprolactinemia can be induced by medications that interfere with dopamine pathways. Metoclopramide, which blocks dopamine receptors, is likely to cause hyperprolactinemia as it leads to increased prolactin release. Bromocriptine, Levodopa, and Amantadine, all of which increase dopamine activity, are unlikely to cause hyperprolactinemia. This conclusion is supported by the understanding of dopamine's role in inhibiting prolactin release and the specific actions of these medications.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Hyperprolactinemia is characterized by an abnormally high level of prolactin in the blood. Prolactin secretion is primarily regulated by dopamine, which inhibits its release. Therefore, drugs that decrease dopamine activity can lead to hyperprolactinemia. Metoclopramide, a drug used primarily for its antiemetic and gastroprokinetic properties, works by blocking dopamine receptors, which can lead to an increase in prolactin levels. On the other hand, Bromocriptine, Levodopa, and Amantadine enhance dopamine activity, which would typically reduce prolactin levels, making them unlikely to cause hyperprolactinemia. Based on this understanding, Metoclopramide is the most likely to cause hyperprolactinemia among the options provided.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
