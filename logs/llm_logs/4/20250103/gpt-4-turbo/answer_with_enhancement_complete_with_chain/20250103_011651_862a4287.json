Anti depressants\nopb. Anti psychotics\nopc. Anti epileptics\nopd. Mood stabilizers\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nSchizophrenia is primarily treated with antipsychotic medications, which effectively decrease psychotic symptoms by blocking dopamine receptors, aligning with the dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia. Mood stabilizers and antidepressants may be used adjunctively for co-occurring mood symptoms or depression but do not directly address the primary psychotic symptoms. Antiepileptics are not standard treatments for schizophrenia as they do not have a clear effect on its core symptoms.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Schizophrenia is a psychiatric disorder characterized primarily by symptoms such as hallucinations, delusions, and disorganized thinking. The primary treatment for schizophrenia involves the use of antipsychotic medications. These medications work mainly by blocking dopamine receptors, which is crucial given the dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia that suggests an overactivity of dopamine transmission. While other medications like mood stabilizers, antidepressants, and antiepileptics can be used to manage co-occurring symptoms such as mood disorders or depression, they do not address the core psychotic symptoms of schizophrenia. Therefore, the consensus in medical treatment for schizophrenia strongly supports the use of antipsychotics as the most effective and direct approach.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
