Leydig cells\nopb. Seolie cells\nopc. Seminiferous tubules\nopd. Epididymis\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nTestosterone production in males is primarily carried out by Leydig cells, located in the interstitial space of the testes. These cells are responsible for synthesizing and secreting testosterone, essential for male reproductive and secondary sexual characteristics. Other options like Sertoli cells, seminiferous tubules, and the epididymis have roles in sperm support, production, and transport respectively, but do not contribute directly to testosterone production.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "
