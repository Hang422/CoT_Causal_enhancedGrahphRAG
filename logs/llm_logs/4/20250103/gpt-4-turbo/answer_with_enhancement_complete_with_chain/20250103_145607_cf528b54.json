Urine osmolality typically falls below 300 mmol/L, with severe cases potentially dropping below 150 mmol/L. The reasoning chains for <600 mmol/L and <900 mmol/L are less accurate as they suggest higher osmolalities not typical for DI. The provided evidence paths do not contribute additional specific insights into the urine osmolality values in DI.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"In Diabetes insipidus (DI), the primary defect is either a lack of production of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) or a resistance to its effects in the kidneys. This condition leads to a decreased ability of the kidneys to concentrate urine, resulting in the production of large volumes of dilute urine. Typically, the urine osmolality in DI is significantly reduced because the kidneys cannot reabsorb water effectively. The normal range for urine osmolality is generally 300-900 mmol/L. In DI, urine osmolality is usually much lower, often falling below 300 mmol/L. In severe cases, it can drop below 150 mmol/L, indicating very dilute urine. Options suggesting higher thresholds such as <600 mmol/L or <900 mmol/L are less typical for DI as they imply a higher concentration of solutes than usually observed in this condition. Therefore, the most accurate option, based on the typical presentation of DI and supported by standard medical knowledge, is that urine osmolality in DI is typically less than 300 mmol/L, with possibilities of dropping even lower in more severe cases.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}",
