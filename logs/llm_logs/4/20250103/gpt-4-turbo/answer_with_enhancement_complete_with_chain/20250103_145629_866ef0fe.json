It is more common with huminsulin\nopb. It may occur in the presence of infections\nopc. It may be due to antibodies to insulin\nopd. Use of glucocorticoids may be useful in severe cases\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nThe statement that use of glucocorticoids may be useful in severe cases of insulin resistance is incorrect. Glucocorticoids are known to increase blood glucose levels and exacerbate insulin resistance, making them counterproductive in managing severe insulin resistance. This is supported by evidence showing that glucocorticoids interact with insulin to cause elevated blood glucose levels, which predisposes individuals to insulin resistance. The other statements are accurate: insulin resistance can indeed occur in the presence of infections due to a stress-induced increase in counter-regulatory hormones, and it may be due to antibodies to insulin which reduce insulin efficacy. Additionally, huminsulin, being a synthetic form of human insulin, does not have a higher incidence of insulin resistance compared to other types of insulin.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Analyzing the provided options in the context of insulin resistance in diabetic patients, we find that most options align with standard medical knowledge except for one. Insulin resistance can indeed occur in the presence of infections due to stress-related hormonal changes that counteract insulin's effects. It can also be caused by antibodies to insulin, which interfere with insulin's action. Regarding the use of huminsulin, it is a synthetic form of human insulin and does not inherently cause more insulin resistance compared to other insulin types. The critical analysis focuses on the statement about glucocorticoids. Contrary to the suggestion that they may be useful in severe cases of insulin resistance, glucocorticoids are known to increase blood glucose levels and can worsen insulin resistance. This is because glucocorticoids interfere with the action of insulin, leading to higher blood glucose levels, which is counterproductive in managing insulin resistance. Therefore, the statement about glucocorticoids being useful in severe cases of insulin resistance is incorrect based on standard medical consensus.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
