He has a history of being treated for duodenal ulcer 4 years back. Investigation reveals elevation of gastrin levels. Which of the following statement is true regarding gastrin?\n\n                    ### Options\n                    opa. Secreted by parietal cells of stomach\nopb. Secreted by alpha ceils of pancreas\nopc. Decreases bicarbonate content in pancreatic secretion\nopd. It gets stimulated by endoluminal peptides in stomach\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nGastrin is secreted by G cells in the stomach, not by parietal or alpha cells of the pancreas. It stimulates gastric acid secretion but does not directly affect pancreatic bicarbonate content. Gastrin is stimulated by peptides and amino acids in the stomach, making option D the correct statement.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Gastrin is a hormone primarily involved in the regulation of gastric acid secretion. It is secreted by G cells located in the antrum of the stomach, not by parietal cells or alpha cells of the pancreas. Gastrin secretion is stimulated by the presence of peptides and amino acids in the stomach, which are detected when proteins are ingested. This stimulation leads to an increase in gastric acid secretion from the parietal cells. The options provided include incorrect statements about the site of secretion and the effects of gastrin. The correct statement, based on standard medical knowledge, is that gastrin is stimulated by endoluminal peptides in the stomach, aligning with option D.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
