INH\nopb. Erythromycin estolate\nopc. Pyrazinamide\nopd. Ethionamide\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nAmong the options provided, Erythromycin estolate is the most common cause of cholestatic jaundice. This is because Erythromycin estolate is known to inhibit bile flow, leading to the accumulation of bile in the liver and subsequently causing cholestatic jaundice. The other drugs listed, such as INH (Isoniazid), Pyrazinamide, and Ethionamide, are more commonly associated with hepatocellular damage rather than cholestasis. INH, for instance, typically causes mild liver enzyme elevation and rarely leads to cholestasis. Similarly, Pyrazinamide and Ethionamide primarily cause hepatocellular damage, making them less likely to cause cholestatic jaundice. The evidence paths confirm the association between liver enzyme disruptions and liver damage but do not specifically support the frequency of cholestasis with these drugs compared to Erythromycin estolate.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Cholestatic jaundice is characterized by the impairment of bile flow, which can be caused by various drugs. Among the options provided, Erythromycin estolate is known to specifically cause cholestatic jaundice due to its mechanism of inhibiting bile flow. This leads to the accumulation of bile in the liver, manifesting as cholestatic jaundice. The other drugs listed, such as INH (Isoniazid), Pyrazinamide, and Ethionamide, are primarily associated with hepatocellular damage rather than cholestasis. INH, for example, is more commonly linked to hepatocellular injury and only rarely causes cholestasis. Pyrazinamide and Ethionamide also typically lead to hepatocellular damage. Therefore, based on the standard medical knowledge and the specific associations of these drugs with liver damage types, Erythromycin estolate is the most likely to cause cholestatic jaundice among the options given.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}",
