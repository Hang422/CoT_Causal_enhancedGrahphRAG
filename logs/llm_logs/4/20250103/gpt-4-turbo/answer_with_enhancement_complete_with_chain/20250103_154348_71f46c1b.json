Vitamin B9\nopb. Vitamin B12\nopc. Vitamin B6\nopd. Vitamin B3\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nIsoniazid use leads to an inhibition of pyridoxine kinase, reducing the activation of vitamin B6 and increasing the risk of vitamin B6 deficiency. This interaction is well-supported by evidence linking isoniazid with disruptions in pyridoxine metabolism. There is no substantial impact of isoniazid on the metabolism of vitamins B12, B9, or B3.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Isoniazid, a commonly used antitubercular medication, is known to interfere with the metabolism of vitamin B6 (pyridoxine). This interference occurs because isoniazid inhibits the enzyme pyridoxine kinase, which is crucial for the activation of vitamin B6. This inhibition leads to a deficiency in vitamin B6 unless supplementation is provided. The relationship between isoniazid and vitamin B6 deficiency is well-documented and widely accepted in medical literature. There is no significant evidence to suggest that isoniazid affects the metabolism of other B vitamins listed in the options (B9, B12, B3) to a clinically relevant extent. Therefore, based on the consensus and the mechanism of action of isoniazid, the most likely vitamin deficiency seen in patients on isoniazid is vitamin B6.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opc\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
