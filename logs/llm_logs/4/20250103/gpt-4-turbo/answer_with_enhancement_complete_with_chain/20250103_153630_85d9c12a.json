Increases liver glycogenolysis\nopb. Causes broachiolar constriction\nopc. Evokes extrasystoles in the heart\nopd. Produces restlessness and anxiety\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nEpinephrine, when administered intravenously in high doses, increases liver glycogenolysis, evokes extrasystoles in the heart, and produces restlessness and anxiety. However, it does not cause bronchiolar constriction; it causes bronchiolar relaxation. This is supported by the activation of beta-2 adrenergic receptors leading to relaxation of bronchiolar smooth muscle, contrary to the incorrect option suggesting constriction.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "### Final Analysis:\nEpinephrine, a catecholamine, acts primarily on alpha and beta adrenergic receptors. When administered intravenously at high doses, it has several physiological effects:\n\n1. **Increases liver glycogenolysis**: Epinephrine stimulates beta-2 adrenergic receptors in the liver, leading to glycogenolysis, which is the breakdown of glycogen to glucose. This is a well-documented effect and aligns with the standard pharmacological action of epinephrine.\n\n2. **Evokes extrasystoles in the heart**: Extrasystoles, or premature heartbeats, can be induced by epinephrine due to its action on beta-1 adrenergic receptors in the heart. This increases cardiac output and can lead to arrhythmias, including extrasystoles.\n\n3. **Produces restlessness and anxiety**: The central nervous system effects of epinephrine include increased alertness, anxiety, and restlessness. These are typical responses to the systemic release of epinephrine, often associated with its 'fight or flight' effect.\n\n4. **Causes bronchiolar constriction**: This is not a typical action of epinephrine. Instead, epinephrine is known to cause bronchiolar relaxation, not constriction, by stimulating beta-2 adrenergic receptors in the bronchial smooth muscle. This leads to the dilation of the bronchioles, which is particularly beneficial in conditions like asthma where bronchoconstriction is a problem.\n\nGiven these points, the action of epinephrine causing bronchiolar constriction is incorrect and not supported by the consensus on its pharmacological effects. The correct answer, based on the established medical understanding of epinephrine's actions, is that it does not cause bronchiolar constriction but rather promotes relaxation of the bronchioles.\n\n### Confidence Assessment:\nThe confidence in this analysis is high due to the clear and well-established pharmacological effects of epinephrine on bronchiolar smooth muscle, supported by both basic and clinical pharmacology literature.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Epinephrine, when administered intravenously at high doses, is known to increase liver glycogenolysis, evoke extrasystoles in the heart, and produce restlessness and anxiety.
