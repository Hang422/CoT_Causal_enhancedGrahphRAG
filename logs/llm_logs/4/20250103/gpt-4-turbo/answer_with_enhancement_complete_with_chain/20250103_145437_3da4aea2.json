Retro bulbar neuritis\nopb. Deafness\nopc. Red urine\nopd. Peripheral neuritis\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nEthambutol is known to cause optic nerve inflammation, which can lead to retrobulbar neuritis, a well-documented side effect. This aligns with evidence indicating a relationship between ethambutol and optic nerve issues. Other options such as deafness, red urine, and peripheral neuritis are not supported by medical consensus or sufficient evidence as direct effects of ethambutol.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Ethambutol is primarily associated with effects on the optic nerve, leading to conditions such as retrobulbar neuritis. This condition involves inflammation of the optic nerve, which can result in visual disturbances. The connection between ethambutol and retrobulbar neuritis is well-documented and recognized in medical literature, making it the most likely side effect among the provided options. Other side effects listed, such as deafness, red urine, and peripheral neuritis, do not have a strong or direct association with ethambutol use based on current medical consensus.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
