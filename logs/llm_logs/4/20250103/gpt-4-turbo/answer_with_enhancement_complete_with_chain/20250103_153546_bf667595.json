Vasopressin\nopb. Terlipressin\nopc. Desmopressin\nopd. Pralipressin\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nDesmopressin is the drug of choice for neurogenic diabetes insipidus due to its ability to effectively mimic natural antidiuretic hormone (ADH), addressing the deficiency seen in this condition. It binds to renal receptors to reduce urine output and increase urine osmolality, thus restoring normal fluid balance. This choice is supported by medical consensus on its mechanism and effectiveness.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Neurogenic diabetes insipidus, also known as central diabetes insipidus, is characterized by a deficiency of antidiuretic hormone (ADH), which leads to excessive urine production and thirst. The treatment goal is to replace ADH and reduce these symptoms. Desmopressin (DDAVP) is a synthetic analogue of ADH that is preferred for its longer duration of action and fewer side effects compared to natural ADH. It specifically targets the renal V2 receptors, which are crucial for water reabsorption in the kidneys. This action effectively reduces urine output and increases urine concentration, addressing the core issue in neurogenic diabetes insipidus. The other options, such as Vasopressin, Terlipressin, and Pralipressin, are either less specific, less effective, or not commonly used for this particular condition. Therefore, based on the consensus in medical literature and practice, Desmopressin is the most appropriate and effective choice for treating neurogenic diabetes insipidus.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opc\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
