Salbutamol\nopb. Ketotifen\nopc. Fluticasone\nopd. Monteleukast\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nSalbutamol is the correct answer as it is a beta adrenergic agonist used as an aerosol in the treatment of bronchial asthma. Other options such as Ketotifen, Fluticasone, and Montelukast do not fit the criteria as they either are not beta adrenergic agonists or are not used as aerosols for asthma treatment.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Salbutamol is a well-known beta adrenergic agonist commonly used in the treatment of bronchial asthma. It functions by relaxing the muscles in the airways and increasing air flow to the lungs, making it effective in relieving symptoms of asthma such as wheezing and shortness of breath. Salbutamol is frequently administered as an aerosol, either through a metered-dose inhaler or a nebulizer, making it highly suitable for direct delivery to the respiratory system. The other options provided do not meet the criteria as effectively: Ketotifen is an antihistamine used for allergic conditions and is not a beta adrenergic agonist; Fluticasone is a corticosteroid used to reduce inflammation and also not a beta adrenergic agonist; Montelukast is a leukotriene receptor antagonist used primarily for its anti-inflammatory effects in asthma and again, not a beta adrenergic agonist. Based on these considerations, Salbutamol aligns best with the description of a beta adrenergic agonist used as an aerosol for asthma treatment.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
