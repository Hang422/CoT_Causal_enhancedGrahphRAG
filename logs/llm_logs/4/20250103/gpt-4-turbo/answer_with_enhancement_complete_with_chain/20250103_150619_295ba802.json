Vitamin A\nopb. Vitamin C\nopc. Vitamin D\nopd. Vitamin B12\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nVitamin D is the most supported vitamin for reducing the risk of insulin resistance, obesity, and metabolic syndrome. It enhances insulin sensitivity and is linked to lower risks of these conditions, as supported by evidence paths connecting insulin sensitivity with reduced risks of metabolic syndrome and insulin resistance.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The question focuses on identifying which vitamin among the listed options reduces the risk of insulin resistance, obesity, and metabolic syndrome. Vitamin D is well-documented in medical literature for its role in enhancing insulin sensitivity and potentially lowering the risk of obesity and metabolic syndrome. Research indicates that Vitamin D improves insulin sensitivity, which is a crucial factor in managing and preventing insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome. The other vitamins listed (Vitamin A, Vitamin C, and Vitamin B12) do not have as direct or robust associations with insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome as Vitamin D does. Therefore, based on the consensus in medical research and the enhanced information provided, Vitamin D is the most supported choice for reducing the risk of these conditions.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opc\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}",
