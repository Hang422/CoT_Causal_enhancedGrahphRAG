      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in the field of Biochemistry.\n                    You are a medical expert determining the final answer.\n\n            ### Instructions:\n            - Use standard medical knowledge as the primary guide.\n            - Consider enhanced information only if it aligns with consensus.\n            - If conflicting or unclear, present the most likely correct answer based on known facts.\n            - It's acceptable to show moderate confidence if the question is complex, but still choose one best answer.\n\n\n                    ### Question\n                    The function of vitamin A is/are related to which of the following?\n\n                    ### Options\n                    opa. Retinol\nopb. Retinal\nopc. Retinoic acids\nopd. All of the above\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nVitamin A is metabolized into retinol, retinal, and retinoic acids, each serving essential physiological functions. Retinol supports vision and skin health, retinal is crucial for vision, particularly night vision, and retinoic acids regulate gene expression and cell differentiation. The correct answer to the function of vitamin A is 'All of the above,' reflecting the diverse and critical roles of its metabolites in human health.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Vitamin A is a crucial nutrient that is metabolized into several biologically active forms, including retinol, retinal, and retinoic acids. Each of these metabolites plays a significant role in human health. Retinol is primarily involved in supporting skin health and vision. Retinal is essential for vision, particularly in low-light conditions (night vision). Retinoic acids are involved in gene expression and the regulation of cell differentiation and growth. The question asks about the functions related to Vitamin A, and given that all these metabolites (retinol, retinal, retinoic acids) are derived from Vitamin A and contribute to its functional roles in the body, the most accurate answer is that all the listed options are correct. This conclusion aligns with standard medical knowledge and the consensus in biochemistry regarding the functions of Vitamin A and its metabolites.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
