Ethanolamine oleate\nopb. Octreotide\nopc. Propanolol\nopd. Phytonadione\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nOctreotide is the drug of choice for acute management of bleeding esophageal varices, acting as a somatostatin analogue to effectively reduce portal and variceal pressure by vasoconstriction. This aligns with medical consensus and is supported by evidence paths linking somatostatin to the treatment of bleeding varices. Propranolol and ethanolamine oleate serve roles in prevention and direct intervention, respectively, while phytonadione is used for supportive care in coagulopathy related to liver disease.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The primary goal in the management of bleeding esophageal varices is to control hemorrhage and stabilize the patient. Octreotide, a somatostatin analogue, is widely recognized and recommended for the acute management of bleeding esophageal varices. It works by reducing splanchnic blood flow and portal pressure, thus helping to control the bleeding. This aligns with the enhanced information provided and is consistent with current medical guidelines and literature. Propranolol is generally used for the prevention of first bleeding or rebleeding in variceal patients, not as an acute treatment. Ethanolamine oleate is used for sclerotherapy but is less commonly the first-line treatment in acute settings compared to pharmacological therapy like octreotide. Phytonadione is relevant in managing coagulopathy but does not directly address the acute bleeding from varices. Therefore, based on the consensus and effectiveness in acute settings, octreotide is the most appropriate choice.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
