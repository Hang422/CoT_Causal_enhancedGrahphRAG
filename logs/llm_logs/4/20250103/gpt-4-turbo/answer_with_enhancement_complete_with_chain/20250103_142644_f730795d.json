B1\nopb. B2\nopc. B6\nopd. B12\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nWernicke's encephalopathy is primarily associated with a deficiency of thiamine, also known as Vitamin B1. This condition is often linked to chronic alcoholism, which impairs the absorption of nutrients including thiamine. The deficiency of thiamine leads to neurological symptoms characteristic of Wernicke's encephalopathy, such as confusion, ataxia, and ophthalmoplegia. Treatment involves the administration of thiamine, which typically results in an effective resolution of symptoms, further confirming the role of Vitamin B1 deficiency in this condition. The retrieved evidence paths support these connections, highlighting the role of thiamine deficiency in causing neurological symptoms and its association with chronic alcoholic intoxication. These paths also confirm that thiamine is crucial for nerve function and its deficiency leads directly to the symptoms observed in Wernicke's encephalopathy. Additionally, the evidence that thiamine treatment resolves conditions like beriberi, which also results from thiamine deficiency, supports the critical role of Vitamin B1 in maintaining neurological health.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Wernicke's encephalopathy is a neurological disorder primarily associated with a deficiency of thiamine, which is Vitamin B1. This condition is commonly seen in individuals with chronic alcoholism, as alcohol impairs the absorption and utilization of thiamine. The symptoms of Wernicke's encephalopathy, which include confusion, ataxia, and ophthalmoplegia, are directly linked to this deficiency. The administration of thiamine is a well-established treatment that often leads to rapid improvement of symptoms, further supporting the critical role of Vitamin B1 deficiency in the development of this condition. The consensus in medical literature and practice clearly supports Vitamin B1 (thiamine) as the major deficient vitamin in Wernicke's encephalopathy.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 98\n}",
