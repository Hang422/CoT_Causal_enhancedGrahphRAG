Better glucose tolerance\nopb. Muscle cramps\nopc. Decrease in urea level\nopd. Hypokalemia\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nTriamterene, a potassium-sparing diuretic, primarily prevents hypokalemia by retaining potassium and can potentially cause muscle cramps due to hyperkalemia. It does not significantly affect urea levels or glucose tolerance.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Triamterene is a potassium-sparing diuretic, which means it helps the body retain potassium while excreting sodium in urine. This mechanism is crucial in preventing hypokalemia (low potassium levels), which is a common side effect of other diuretics. Therefore, option 'opd. Hypokalemia' is incorrect as Triamterene does the opposite by preventing hypokalemia. Regarding 'opc. Decrease in urea level', Triamterene does not significantly affect urea levels, making this option incorrect. 'opa. Better glucose tolerance' is also not supported as Triamterene does not have a significant impact on glucose metabolism. The most plausible side effect of Triamterene, given its function and mechanism, is 'opb. Muscle cramps'. This can occur due to electrolyte imbalances, particularly in the context of potential hyperkalemia (high potassium levels), which can happen with potassium-sparing agents like Triamterene. Therefore, based on the mechanism of action of Triamterene and common side effects associated with its use, muscle cramps are a likely adverse effect.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
