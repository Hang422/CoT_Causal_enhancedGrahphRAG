Contraction of gall bladder\nopb. Secretion of pancreatic juice rich in enzymes\nopc. Increases the secretion of enterokinase\nopd. All\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nCholecystokinin (CCK) is known for stimulating the gallbladder to contract and the pancreas to secrete enzyme-rich pancreatic juice, both well-supported by medical consensus and evidence paths. The role of CCK in directly increasing the secretion of enterokinase is less clear and not strongly supported by current medical understanding or evidence paths.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Cholecystokinin (CCK) is a well-studied gastrointestinal hormone with specific roles in the digestive system. It is known to cause the contraction of the gallbladder, which aids in the release of stored bile into the small intestine. Additionally, CCK stimulates the pancreas to secrete pancreatic juice that is rich in digestive enzymes, facilitating the breakdown of fats, proteins, and carbohydrates. These actions are well-supported by medical consensus and evidence. However, the role of CCK in the secretion of enterokinase, an enzyme involved in protein digestion, is not clearly established or supported by strong evidence in the medical literature. Therefore, while CCK has multiple functions, the most accurate and supported answer, considering the options provided, includes the well-documented effects on the gallbladder and pancreas but not necessarily on enterokinase secretion.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
