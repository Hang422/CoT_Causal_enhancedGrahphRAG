Propanolol\nopb. Aiprazolam\nopc. Buspirone\nopd. Haloperidol\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nPropranolol, while a beta-blocker used mainly for cardiovascular issues, is sometimes used off-label for physical symptoms of anxiety but is not a primary treatment for anxiety disorders. Alprazolam and Buspirone are both well-documented treatments for anxiety disorders, with Alprazolam being a benzodiazepine and Buspirone an anxiolytic specifically for GAD. Haloperidol, an antipsychotic, is not used for treating anxiety, focusing instead on schizophrenia and acute psychosis. Therefore, Haloperidol is the drug not used for anxiety among the options.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Analyzing the provided options for medications not used for anxiety, we find that Propranolol, Alprazolam, and Buspirone have roles in the management of anxiety. Propranolol, primarily a beta-blocker for cardiovascular issues, is also used off-label to manage physical symptoms of anxiety, such as tremors and palpitations, though it is not a primary treatment for anxiety disorders. Alprazolam, a benzodiazepine, is commonly prescribed for anxiety, particularly for its rapid relief of symptoms. Buspirone is specifically indicated for generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), providing a non-benzodiazepine option for long-term management of anxiety. Haloperidol, however, is an antipsychotic primarily used for conditions like schizophrenia and acute psychotic states and does not have a role in the treatment of anxiety disorders. Based on this analysis, Haloperidol is the correct answer as it is not used for treating anxiety.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
