Morphine patch\nopb. Diazepam\nopc. Clobazam\nopd. Haloperidol\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nMorphine, as an opioid analgesic, directly reduces respiratory drive and palliates dyspnoea by decreasing the sensation of breathlessness, aligning with medical consensus for its use in palliative care. Benzodiazepines like Diazepam and Clobazam, while reducing anxiety, have minimal direct effect on respiratory function and are not primarily used for dyspnoea palliation. Haloperidol, an antipsychotic, is not used for dyspnoea and has no direct effect on respiratory symptoms.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The primary medical principle in managing dyspnoea, especially in palliative care settings such as in a patient with cancer of the lung, involves the use of medications that can directly alleviate the sensation of breathlessness. Morphine is well-documented in medical literature for its efficacy in reducing the sensation of dyspnoea. It achieves this by decreasing the respiratory drive and altering the central perception of breathlessness, which is crucial in palliative care. Diazepam and Clobazam, both benzodiazepines, primarily act by reducing anxiety and do not directly impact the mechanisms of breathlessness, making them less suitable for the direct palliation of dyspnoea. Haloperidol, an antipsychotic, is not indicated for the treatment of dyspnoea as it does not have effects on respiratory symptoms. Based on this analysis, Morphine, delivered via a patch for sustained relief, is the most appropriate choice for the palliation of dyspnoea in a lung cancer patient.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
