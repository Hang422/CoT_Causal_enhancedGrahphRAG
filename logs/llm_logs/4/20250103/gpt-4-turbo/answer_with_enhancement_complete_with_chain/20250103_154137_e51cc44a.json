Tyrosine transaminase\nopb. Tyrosine hydroxylase\nopc. Phenylalanine hydroxylase\nopd. Phenylketonuria hydroxylase\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nPhenylketonuria is caused by a deficiency in phenylalanine hydroxylase, which leads to an inability to convert phenylalanine to tyrosine, causing its accumulation and resulting in phenylketonuria. This is supported by evidence linking phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency to increased phenylalanine levels, a key factor in the development of phenylketonuria.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Phenylketonuria (PKU) is a genetic disorder characterized by a deficiency in the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase. This enzyme is crucial for the metabolic pathway that converts the amino acid phenylalanine into tyrosine. Without functional phenylalanine hydroxylase, phenylalanine accumulates in the body, leading to various health issues, including intellectual disability and other neurological problems if untreated. The medical consensus and standard biochemical knowledge clearly support that the deficiency of phenylalanine hydroxylase is responsible for phenylketonuria. The other options listed, such as tyrosine transaminase, tyrosine hydroxylase, and a non-existent 'phenylketonuria hydroxylase,' do not align with the cause of PKU. Therefore, based on a thorough understanding of the biochemical pathways and genetic basis of PKU, the correct answer is phenylalanine hydroxylase.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opc\",\n  \"confidence\": 98\n}",
