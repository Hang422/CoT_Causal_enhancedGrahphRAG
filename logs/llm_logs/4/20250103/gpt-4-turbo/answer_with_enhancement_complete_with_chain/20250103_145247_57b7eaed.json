Monotherapy for acute episodes\nopb. Monitoring of serum concentration is not useful for guiding dose adjustment\nopc. Can result in leucocytosis\nopd. Can result in hypehyroidism on long term use\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nLithium is typically used in combination therapy for acute bipolar episodes, not as monotherapy. Monitoring of serum lithium levels is crucial for dose adjustment due to its narrow therapeutic window. Lithium treatment can lead to leucocytosis. Long-term use of lithium is associated with hypothyroidism, not hyperthyroidism.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Lithium is a well-established treatment for bipolar disorder, particularly in the management of both acute and maintenance phases. However, it is generally not used as monotherapy for acute episodes, as it is often combined with other medications like antipsychotics or anticonvulsants to manage symptoms more effectively. Monitoring serum lithium concentrations is essential due to its narrow therapeutic index, making option 'opb' incorrect. Regarding the side effects, lithium is known to cause leucocytosis, which is an increase in white blood cells, aligning with option 'opc'. It is also associated with thyroid dysfunction; however, it more commonly leads to hypothyroidism rather than hyperthyroidism, thus making option 'opd' incorrect. Based on these considerations, the most accurate statement about lithium use in manic-depressive psychosis is that it can result in leucocytosis.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opc\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
