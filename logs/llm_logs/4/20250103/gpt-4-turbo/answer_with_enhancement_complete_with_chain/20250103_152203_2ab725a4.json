Aprepitant\nopb. Dexamethasone\nopc. Ondansetrin\nopd. All of the above\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nAprepitant, Dexamethasone, and Ondansetron are all used to manage chemotherapy-induced vomiting, each through distinct mechanisms: Aprepitant as an NK1 receptor antagonist, Dexamethasone as a corticosteroid, and Ondansetron as a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist. Their combined use is often employed in clinical settings to achieve a synergistic effect in preventing nausea and vomiting induced by chemotherapy.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The question asks for the drug used in managing chemotherapy-induced vomiting. Aprepitant acts as an NK1 receptor antagonist, Dexamethasone serves as a corticosteroid, and Ondansetron functions as a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist. Each of these drugs is used individually to prevent or treat nausea and vomiting caused by chemotherapy. However, their mechanisms of action are different, and they are often used together in clinical practice to provide a comprehensive approach to managing these side effects, leveraging their synergistic effects. Given that all three drugs are validated for this use and often employed together, the best answer, supported by medical consensus on the management of chemotherapy-induced vomiting, is that all the listed drugs are used.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
