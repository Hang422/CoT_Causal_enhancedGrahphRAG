What action should be taken regarding the treatment of the nurse\n\n                    ### Options\n                    opa. Monitor the nurse's blood to determine whether HIV transmission has occurred or not.\nopb. Treat with full doses of zidovudine for 2weeks.\nopc. Add acyclovir to the 4weeks zidovudine regimen\nopd. Administer zidovudine with lamivudine for 4weeks.\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nFor a nurse exposed to HIV through a needle stick injury from an AIDS patient, the recommended action is to immediately initiate post-exposure prophylaxis with zidovudine and lamivudine for 4 weeks. This combination therapy is supported by medical consensus for its efficacy in preventing HIV transmission in high-risk exposures. Subsequent monitoring of the nurse's HIV status is crucial to assess the effectiveness of PEP and confirm transmission status.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"In the scenario of a nurse experiencing a needle stick injury from an AIDS patient with a high viral load, the immediate concern is the potential transmission of HIV. The core medical principle in such cases is to initiate post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) as soon as possible to reduce the risk of HIV infection. The recommended regimen for PEP, according to current medical guidelines and consensus, includes a combination of antiretroviral drugs. Specifically, the combination of zidovudine and lamivudine for 4 weeks is supported by evidence for its efficacy in preventing HIV transmission following high-risk exposure. This approach is preferred over merely monitoring the nurse's blood for HIV transmission or using incomplete or inappropriate antiviral therapies. Therefore, the best-supported option based on the consensus and the enhanced information provided is to administer zidovudine with lamivudine for 4 weeks.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
