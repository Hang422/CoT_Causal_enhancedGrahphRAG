HDL\nopb. LDL\nopc. VLDL\nopd. Chylomicrons\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nCholesterol synthesized in the liver is primarily transported to peripheral tissues via VLDL, which is converted into LDL as it delivers triglycerides to cells. VLDL is the initial transporter, while LDL, formed from VLDL, continues to carry cholesterol directly to peripheral cells. HDL is involved in reverse transport to the liver, and chylomicrons transport dietary lipids from intestines, not involved in liver-to-peripheral tissue cholesterol transport.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Cholesterol synthesized in the liver is primarily transported to peripheral tissues. The liver synthesizes very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL), which carries triglycerides and cholesterol. As VLDL delivers triglycerides to cells, it is converted into low-density lipoprotein (LDL). LDL then becomes the primary carrier of cholesterol to peripheral tissues. High-density lipoprotein (HDL) mainly functions in reverse cholesterol transport, moving cholesterol from peripheral tissues back to the liver. Chylomicrons are primarily involved in transporting dietary lipids from the intestines and are not directly involved in the liver-to-peripheral tissue cholesterol transport. Based on this understanding, while VLDL initiates the transport, LDL is the main transporter of cholesterol to peripheral tissues after conversion from VLDL. Therefore, LDL is the most accurate answer for the primary transporter of cholesterol from the liver to peripheral tissues.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}",
