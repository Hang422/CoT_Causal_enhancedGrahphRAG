Arachidonic acid\nopb. Cholesterol\nopc. Palmitic acid\nopd. Stearic acid\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nArachidonic acid, an unsaturated fatty acid, increases plasma membrane fluidity by preventing tight packing of lipids. Cholesterol modulates fluidity; it increases fluidity at low concentrations but decreases it at high concentrations. Both palmitic and stearic acids, being saturated, decrease membrane fluidity by enabling tighter packing of lipids. The evidence paths confirm the saturated nature of palmitic and stearic acids but do not alter the biochemical consensus on their effects on membrane fluidity.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The fluidity of the plasma membrane is crucial for various cellular processes, including the functioning of membrane proteins and the movement of substances across the membrane. The fluidity is influenced by the types of fatty acids present in the phospholipids of the membrane. Unsaturated fatty acids, such as arachidonic acid, have one or more double bonds that create kinks, preventing the fatty acids from packing tightly together, thus increasing membrane fluidity. On the other hand, saturated fatty acids like palmitic acid and stearic acid lack double bonds, which allows them to pack closely together, decreasing membrane fluidity. Cholesterol also plays a role in modulating membrane fluidity; it can increase fluidity at lower concentrations by preventing fatty acids from packing too tightly, but at higher concentrations, it can decrease fluidity by stabilizing the membrane structure. Given the options provided and the consensus in biochemical principles, arachidonic acid, being an unsaturated fatty acid, most directly increases the fluidity of the plasma membrane by preventing the tight packing of lipids.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}",
