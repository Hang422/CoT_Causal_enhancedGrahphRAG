Penicillin G\nopb. Tetracycline\nopc. Azithromycin\nopd. Doxycycline\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nPenicillin G is the drug of choice for treating Treponema pallidum, the causative agent of syphilis, as recommended by the CDC. It is effective at all stages of the disease due to its bactericidal effect, which involves disrupting the bacterial cell wall synthesis. For individuals allergic to penicillin, Doxycycline serves as an alternative treatment, though it is less effective than Penicillin G. Other antibiotics like Azithromycin and Tetracycline are also used in some cases but are generally less preferred due to potential resistance and side effects. The evidence path confirming Treponema pallidum as the cause of syphilis supports the use of these antibiotics, particularly emphasizing the primary role of Penicillin G in treatment.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The primary medical consensus indicates that Penicillin G is the most effective treatment for Treponema pallidum, the bacterium responsible for syphilis. This is supported by guidelines from reputable health organizations such as the CDC, which recommend Penicillin G due to its bactericidal properties that disrupt bacterial cell wall synthesis. While alternatives like Doxycycline, Azithromycin, and Tetracycline are available for those allergic to penicillin, they are generally considered less effective and sometimes face issues with resistance. Therefore, based on the standard medical knowledge and the enhanced information provided, Penicillin G is the most appropriate and effective choice for treating Treponema pallidum.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
