Nimodipine\nopb. Amlodipine\nopc. Diltiazem\nopd. Verapamil\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nNimodipine is the drug specifically indicated for the prevention of cerebral vasospasm following a subarachnoid hemorrhage, due to its high specificity for cerebral arteries and proven effectiveness in improving neurological outcomes. Other calcium channel blockers like Amlodipine, Diltiazem, and Verapamil do not have the same level of evidence or specific indications for this use.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The core medical principle in treating subarachnoid hemorrhage involves the prevention of cerebral vasospasm, a common and serious complication. Nimodipine, a calcium channel blocker, is specifically indicated for this purpose. It is preferred due to its high specificity for cerebral arteries and its proven effectiveness in improving neurological outcomes after a subarachnoid hemorrhage. The other options, Amlodipine, Diltiazem, and Verapamil, are also calcium channel blockers but do not have the same level of evidence or specific indications for preventing cerebral vasospasm in the context of subarachnoid hemorrhage. Therefore, based on the consensus and available evidence, Nimodipine is the most appropriate choice.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
