      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in the field of Pharmacology.\n                    You are a medical expert determining the final answer.\n\n            ### Instructions:\n            - Use standard medical knowledge as the primary guide.\n            - Consider enhanced information only if it aligns with consensus.\n            - If conflicting or unclear, present the most likely correct answer based on known facts.\n            - It's acceptable to show moderate confidence if the question is complex, but still choose one best answer.\n\n\n                    ### Question\n                    Which of the following anti-tubercular drug is avoided in a HIV positive patient on zidovudine, lamivudine and indinavir therapy who develops TB?\n\n                    ### Options\n                    opa. Pyrazinamide\nopb. Isoniazid\nopc. Ethambutol\nopd. Rifampicin\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nRifampicin is avoided in HIV positive patients on a regimen of zidovudine, lamivudine, and indinavir due to its potent enzyme-inducing effects in the liver. This induction leads to increased metabolism of indinavir, a key antiretroviral drug, thereby reducing its effectiveness and potentially compromising HIV treatment. The other drugs listed, Pyrazinamide, Isoniazid, and Ethambutol, do not show significant interactions with the antiretroviral medications and are considered safe for use in this patient scenario. The evidence path confirming Pyrazinamide's role in treating tuberculosis supports its safe use but does not directly impact the decision regarding Rifampicin.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The primary concern in selecting an anti-tubercular drug for a patient who is HIV positive and on a regimen of zidovudine, lamivudine, and indinavir is avoiding drug interactions that could compromise the effectiveness of the HIV treatment. Rifampicin is known for its potent enzyme-inducing effects in the liver, which can lead to increased metabolism of certain drugs, including indinavir. This interaction can significantly reduce the plasma concentrations and effectiveness of indinavir, thereby impacting the overall management of HIV in the patient. The other drugs listed, such as Pyrazinamide, Isoniazid, and Ethambutol, do not exhibit significant interactions with the antiretroviral medications used in this scenario, making them safer choices. Based on this understanding and the consensus in medical guidelines, Rifampicin should be avoided in this specific patient context to maintain the efficacy of the HIV treatment regimen.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
