Heparin sulfate\nopb. Protamine sulfate\nopc. Low molecular weight heparin\nopd. Warfarin\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nFor the prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism in patients undergoing cancer surgery, Low Molecular Weight Heparin (LMWH) is the anticoagulant of choice. This decision is supported by clinical guidelines and evidence demonstrating its efficacy and safety profile in cancer patients. LMWH is preferred over unfractionated heparin (heparin sulfate) due to its more predictable anticoagulant effect and lower risk of bleeding. Warfarin, while effective for long-term anticoagulation, is not ideal for immediate postoperative prophylaxis due to its need for careful monitoring and dose adjustment. Protamine sulfate is not used as a prophylactic agent but rather as a reversal agent for heparin, confirming its inappropriateness for this indication. The evidence path highlighting the interaction between anticoagulants and thrombosis supports the use of anticoagulants like LMWH to prevent thrombosis in high-risk scenarios such as post-cancer surgery.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The question pertains to the selection of an appropriate anticoagulant for prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism in patients undergoing cancer surgery. The options provided include Heparin sulfate, Protamine sulfate, Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), and Warfarin. Protamine sulfate is primarily used as a reversal agent for heparin and not as a prophylactic anticoagulant, eliminating it as a suitable choice. Heparin sulfate, while an anticoagulant, is less favored in this scenario due to its less predictable effects and higher risk of bleeding compared to LMWH. Warfarin, known for its use in long-term anticoagulation, requires careful monitoring and dose adjustments, making it less ideal for immediate postoperative prophylaxis. Low molecular weight heparin is widely recognized and recommended in clinical guidelines for this specific use due to its efficacy, safety profile, and more predictable pharmacokinetics in cancer patients. Therefore, based on standard medical knowledge and consensus, LMWH is the most appropriate choice for the prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism in patients undergoing cancer surgery.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opc\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
