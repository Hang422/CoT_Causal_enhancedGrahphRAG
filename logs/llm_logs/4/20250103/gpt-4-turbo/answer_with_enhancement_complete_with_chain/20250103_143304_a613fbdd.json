Adenylyl cyclase\nopc. Na+-K+-ATPase\nopd. Galactosyl transferase\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nAmong the options provided, 5'-nucleotidase, Adenylyl cyclase, and Na+-K+-ATPase are confirmed enzymatic markers of the plasma membrane, supported by physiological consensus and relevant evidence paths. Galactosyl transferase, primarily associated with the Golgi apparatus, is correctly identified as not a plasma membrane marker.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "### Core Medical Principle:\nThe question focuses on identifying which of the listed enzymes is not typically a marker of the plasma membrane. Enzymatic markers of the plasma membrane are those enzymes that are predominantly located in or function at the plasma membrane, playing roles in signal transduction, ion transport, or other membrane-associated processes.\n\n### Analysis:\n1. **5'-nucleotidase** - This enzyme is well-documented as a plasma membrane marker. It is involved in the hydrolysis of nucleotide monophosphates and plays a role in purinergic signaling.\n\n2. **Adenylyl cyclase** - This enzyme is also a known plasma membrane marker. It catalyzes the conversion of ATP to cyclic AMP (cAMP) and is crucial in the signaling pathways mediated by G protein-coupled receptors.\n\n3. **Na+-K+-ATPase** - This is a key enzyme located in the plasma membrane, responsible for maintaining the electrochemical gradient across the membrane by pumping sodium out of and potassium into the cell.\n\n4. **Galactosyl transferase** - Typically associated with the Golgi apparatus, this enzyme functions in the synthesis of glycoproteins by transferring galactose to growing oligosaccharide chains. It is not commonly described as a plasma membrane marker.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBased on the standard medical knowledge and the roles of these enzymes, Galactosyl transferase is the correct answer as it is primarily associated with the Golgi apparatus rather than the plasma membrane. This aligns with the consensus in physiological literature and cellular biology.\n\n### Final Output:\n```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"After evaluating the roles and typical locations of the enzymes listed, it is clear that Galactosyl transferase, primarily associated with the Golgi apparatus, is not a marker of the plasma membrane. This conclusion is supported by standard medical knowledge and physiological consensus.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
