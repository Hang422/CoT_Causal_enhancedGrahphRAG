Protein linked with glycosidic bond\nopb. Core protein\nopc. Sugar residues are long in carbohydrate poion of glycoprotein\nopd. None\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nGlycoproteins are characterized by a core protein structure and the presence of glycosidic bonds linking carbohydrates to the protein's amino acid side chains. The length of sugar residues in glycoproteins can vary and is not a defining characteristic. Biochemical consensus supports these characteristics, and while the provided evidence paths confirm general protein-carbohydrate interactions, they do not specifically address these points in detail.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Glycoproteins are proteins that have carbohydrate groups attached to the polypeptide chain. The attachment of these carbohydrate groups to the protein is indeed through glycosidic bonds, which is a key characteristic of glycoproteins. Additionally, glycoproteins are defined by having a core protein structure, which is essential for their function and classification as glycoproteins. The length of sugar residues in the carbohydrate portion of glycoproteins can vary significantly and is not a consistent or defining characteristic. Therefore, the most accurate descriptions of glycoproteins among the provided options are that they include a core protein and involve glycosidic bonds. However, since the option that mentions glycosidic bonds (opa) incorrectly implies that the protein itself is linked with a glycosidic bond rather than the carbohydrates being linked to the protein through these bonds, the best choice based on standard medical knowledge is that glycoproteins have a core protein structure.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
