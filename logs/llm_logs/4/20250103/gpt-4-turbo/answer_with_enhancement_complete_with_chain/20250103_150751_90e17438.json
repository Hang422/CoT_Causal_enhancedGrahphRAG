Fever\nopb. Peptic ulcer\nopc. Unstable angina\nopd. Myalgia\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nAspirin is contraindicated in peptic ulcer due to its mechanism of inhibiting prostaglandins, which leads to an increase in stomach acid secretion and can aggravate peptic ulcers. This aligns with medical consensus and is supported by evidence showing interactions between aspirin, pharmaceutical preparations, and prostaglandins. In contrast, aspirin is not contraindicated in fever, unstable angina, or myalgia. It has anti-inflammatory properties that reduce fever and alleviate pain from myalgia, and its antiplatelet effect is beneficial in preventing blood clot formation, which is crucial in the management of unstable angina.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Aspirin is known to inhibit the production of prostaglandins, which are substances that protect the stomach lining by promoting the secretion of mucus and bicarbonate, as well as enhancing blood flow to the stomach. This protective mechanism is compromised when prostaglandins are inhibited, leading to an increased risk of gastric mucosal damage and exacerbation of peptic ulcers. Therefore, aspirin is contraindicated in individuals with peptic ulcers to prevent further gastric irritation and potential bleeding. In contrast, aspirin is beneficial in cases of fever, unstable angina, and myalgia. It reduces fever through its action on the hypothalamic heat-regulating center, helps prevent clot formation in unstable angina, and alleviates pain in myalgia due to its anti-inflammatory properties. Thus, based on the medical consensus and the mechanism of action of aspirin, the most accurate answer is that aspirin is contraindicated in peptic ulcer.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
