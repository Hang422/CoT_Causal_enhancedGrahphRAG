Selenium\nopb. Phosphorus\nopc. Boron\nopd. Zinc\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nSelenium deficiency is well-documented to cause Keshan disease, a specific type of cardiomyopathy, supported by its crucial role in antioxidant activity and protection against cellular damage in the heart. Other options like phosphorus, boron, and zinc, while important for overall health, do not have as direct or well-established links to cardiomyopathy as selenium.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The question focuses on identifying which mineral deficiency is most commonly associated with cardiomyopathy. Selenium deficiency is well-known for causing Keshan disease, a type of cardiomyopathy. This connection is supported by selenium's role in antioxidant activities that protect against cellular damage in the heart. The other minerals listed - phosphorus, boron, and zinc - while essential for health, do not have a direct and well-documented link to causing cardiomyopathy. Therefore, based on the consensus in medical literature and the specific association between selenium deficiency and Keshan disease, selenium is the most likely correct answer.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
