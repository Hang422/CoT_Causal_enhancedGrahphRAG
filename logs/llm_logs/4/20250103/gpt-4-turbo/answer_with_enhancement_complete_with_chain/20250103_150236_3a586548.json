Mouth\nopb. Stomach\nopc. Small intestine\nopd. Large intestine\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nDigestion of disaccharides primarily occurs in the small intestine. Disaccharides such as sucrose, lactose, and maltose are not significantly broken down in the mouth as salivary amylase targets polysaccharides like starch, not disaccharides. In the stomach, the acidic environment deactivates salivary amylase, and no specific enzymes for disaccharide digestion are present. Once disaccharides reach the small intestine, specific enzymes called disaccharidases (including lactase, sucrase, and maltase) break them down into monosaccharides, which can then be absorbed. This process is supported by evidence indicating the presence of disaccharides and relevant enzymes in the small intestine. The large intestine does not play a significant role in the digestion of disaccharides, as it lacks the necessary enzymes, and any disaccharides reaching this region are typically fermented by microbiota rather than digested.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The digestion of disaccharides such as sucrose, lactose, and maltose primarily occurs in the small intestine. This is because the specific enzymes necessary for breaking down disaccharides into monosaccharides, known as disaccharidases (including lactase, sucrase, and maltase), are located in the small intestine. While the mouth involves the breakdown of polysaccharides through salivary amylase, it does not significantly affect disaccharides. The stomach's acidic environment further deactivates salivary amylase and lacks enzymes for disaccharide digestion. The large intestine does not contribute to the digestion of disaccharides, as it primarily involves the fermentation of undigested material by microbiota. Therefore, based on standard medical knowledge and the consensus in physiological understanding, the digestion of disaccharides occurs in the small intestine.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opc\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
