Stagnant hypoxia\nopb. Anemic hypoxia\nopc. Hypoxic hypoxia\nopd. Histotoxic hypoxia\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nShock primarily causes hypoxic hypoxia, characterized by inadequate tissue perfusion and reduced oxygen delivery to tissues. This is due to decreased cardiac output and effective blood volume, which are common in shock states. The evidence supports these connections, while other types of hypoxia like anemic and histotoxic are less directly related to the primary effects of shock.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Shock is a critical condition that results in inadequate tissue perfusion and oxygen delivery. The primary mechanism in shock, regardless of its type (e.g., hypovolemic, cardiogenic, septic), is the reduction in effective blood flow and oxygen delivery to tissues. This leads to hypoxic hypoxia, where there is insufficient oxygen reaching the tissues primarily due to decreased cardiac output or blood volume. Other types of hypoxia, such as anemic hypoxia (reduced oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood), histotoxic hypoxia (tissues unable to use oxygen), and stagnant hypoxia (slow blood flow), although possible, are not the direct primary mechanisms in shock. The enhanced information provided aligns well with standard medical understanding that hypoxic hypoxia is the most directly related type of hypoxia in shock states. Therefore, based on the consensus and the evidence, hypoxic hypoxia is the most appropriate answer.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opc\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
