Fibrinolysis\nopb. Activation of collagenase\nopc. Destruction of VWF\nopd. Stabilization of fibrin\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nPlasmin's established functions include fibrinolysis, activation of collagenase, and destruction of VWF, aligning with options A, B, and C respectively. The claim that plasmin stabilizes fibrin (option D) contradicts its well-known role in fibrin degradation, making option D the correct answer as it does not represent a function of plasmin.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Plasmin is primarily known for its role in the fibrinolytic system, where it degrades fibrin clots, a process known as fibrinolysis. This aligns with option A. Additionally, plasmin is involved in the activation of collagenase (option B) and the destruction of von Willebrand factor (VWF) (option C), both of which are supported by established physiological knowledge. However, option D, which suggests that plasmin stabilizes fibrin, contradicts its fundamental role in breaking down fibrin. Therefore, based on the core medical principles and the consensus in physiological literature, option D is identified as the function that plasmin does not perform.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
