Carbamazepine\nopb. Vigabatrin\nopc. Sodium valproate\nopd. Lamotrigine\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nCarbamazepine, sodium valproate, and lamotrigine are all used as mood stabilizers and are indicated for the treatment of bipolar disorder, aligning with medical consensus and supported by their interactions as pharmaceutical preparations with mood stabilizing properties. Vigabatrin, however, is primarily used for epilepsy and is not typically indicated for bipolar disorder, which is consistent with its primary complication with epilepsy and lack of association with mood stabilization.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Carbamazepine, sodium valproate, and lamotrigine are well-documented in medical literature as mood stabilizers used in the treatment of bipolar disorder. These drugs are commonly prescribed to manage and stabilize mood swings associated with bipolar disorder. On the other hand, Vigabatrin is primarily used to treat epilepsy and is not typically indicated for bipolar disorder. It does not have the mood-stabilizing properties required for the treatment of bipolar disorder, and its use is more focused on controlling seizures. Therefore, based on the consensus in medical guidelines and literature, Vigabatrin is the correct answer as it is not indicated for the treatment of bipolar disorder.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
