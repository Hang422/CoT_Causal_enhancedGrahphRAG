Methimazole\nopb. Propylthiouraril\nopc. Carbimazole\nopd. Perchlorate\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nPropylthiouracil (PTU) is the preferred drug for managing hyperthyroidism during the first trimester of pregnancy due to its lower risk of teratogenic effects compared to Methimazole, making it safer for the developing fetus. Methimazole and Carbimazole, being associated with higher teratogenic risks, are not recommended during this period. Perchlorate, less effective and less studied, is not a first-line treatment. The choice of Propylthiouracil is supported by evidence indicating its use in treating hyperthyroidism.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"In managing hyperthyroidism during the first trimester of pregnancy, the primary concern is the safety of the drug for both the mother and the developing fetus. Methimazole and Carbimazole are known to have higher risks of teratogenic effects, which can lead to congenital malformations. Propylthiouracil (PTU), on the other hand, is generally considered safer during the first trimester due to its lower risk of causing such effects. Perchlorate is not commonly used as a first-line treatment due to its lesser effectiveness and limited study in this context. Therefore, based on the consensus in medical guidelines and literature, Propylthiouracil is the preferred choice for treating hyperthyroidism in the first trimester of pregnancy.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
