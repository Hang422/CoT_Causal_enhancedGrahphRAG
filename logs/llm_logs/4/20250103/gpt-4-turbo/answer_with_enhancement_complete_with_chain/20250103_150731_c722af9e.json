All of the following are true about heparin except-\n\n                    ### Options\n                    opa. Weakest acid found in living things\nopb. Most commercial preparations of heparin now utilize pig intestinal slimes\nopc. Act via Antithrombin activation\nopd. Produce thrombocytopenia\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nAmong the statements about heparin, the claim that it is the weakest acid found in living things is false. Heparin is a sulfated glycosaminoglycan and not the weakest acid biologically. Other statements regarding its sourcing from pig intestinal mucosa, mechanism via antithrombin activation, and potential to produce thrombocytopenia are all true and align with medical consensus.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Heparin is a well-known anticoagulant used in various medical settings, including cardiac surgery. Its primary mechanism of action involves the activation of antithrombin, which then inhibits thrombin and factor Xa, crucial components in the clotting cascade. This mechanism is well-documented and aligns with the consensus in medical literature, supporting the accuracy of option 'opc'. Heparin is indeed sourced from pig intestinal mucosa, which is a common practice for the commercial production of this drug, confirming the validity of option 'opb'. Additionally, one of the known side effects of heparin is heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), a condition where the platelet count falls, sometimes dramatically, which is a recognized complication as stated in option 'opd'. The statement in option 'opa' that heparin is the weakest acid found in living things is incorrect. Heparin is a sulfated glycosaminoglycan, and while it does have acidic properties due to its sulfate groups, it is not classified as the weakest acid biologically. There are many other substances within living organisms that would qualify as weaker acids. Therefore, option 'opa' is the incorrect statement among the options provided.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
