Proximal tubule\nopb. Distal tubules\nopc. Loop of Henle\nopd. Collecting duct\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nAldosterone primarily acts on the distal tubules and collecting ducts of the kidney by binding to mineralocorticoid receptors, increasing sodium reabsorption, and enhancing potassium excretion. This action helps regulate electrolyte balance and blood pressure. The evidence supports aldosterone's interaction with renal cells in these areas, confirming its role in modulating water and electrolyte balance specifically at these sites.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Aldosterone is a hormone that plays a crucial role in the regulation of electrolyte and fluid balance in the body. Its primary site of action is in the kidneys, specifically targeting the distal tubules and the collecting ducts. Here, aldosterone binds to mineralocorticoid receptors, which leads to increased reabsorption of sodium and water into the bloodstream, while enhancing the excretion of potassium. This mechanism is fundamental in managing blood pressure and electrolyte balance. The enhanced information provided aligns well with standard medical knowledge, confirming that the action of aldosterone predominantly affects the distal tubules and collecting ducts. Therefore, while both options 'Distal tubules' and 'Collecting duct' are correct, the most encompassing option that covers the primary sites of aldosterone action is 'Distal tubules', as it generally refers to the latter part of the renal tubule system which includes the collecting ducts.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
