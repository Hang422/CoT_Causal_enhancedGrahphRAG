Lipase\nopb. Pepsinogens\nopc. HCI\nopd. None\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nThe stomach secretes lipase, pepsinogens, and hydrochloric acid (HCl). Lipase, although secreted in smaller amounts compared to pancreatic lipase, plays a role in fat digestion. Pepsinogens are precursors to pepsin, crucial for protein digestion, and are activated by the acidic environment produced by HCl secretion. Therefore, all options listed (lipase, pepsinogens, HCl) are indeed secreted by the stomach, making the option 'None' incorrect. The evidence paths support the secretion roles of these substances, aligning well with medical consensus.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The stomach is known to secrete several substances that aid in digestion, including lipase, pepsinogens, and hydrochloric acid (HCl). Lipase in the stomach, although present in smaller quantities compared to its pancreatic counterpart, assists in the digestion of fats. Pepsinogens are zymogens or inactive forms of the enzyme pepsin, which when activated by the acidic environment provided by HCl, break down proteins into peptides. Hydrochloric acid not only helps in the activation of pepsinogens but also kills bacteria and provides an acidic pH suitable for enzymatic activity in the stomach. Given that all these substances are indeed secreted by the stomach, the option 'None' correctly states that none of the listed options are 'not secreted by the stomach'. Therefore, based on the standard medical knowledge and the information provided, the correct answer is that none of the options listed fail to be secreted by the stomach.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
