Activation of protein kinase\nopb. Activation of adenylate cyclase\nopc. Ca2+ release.\nopd. All\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nCyclic AMP (cAMP) primarily acts through the activation of protein kinase A (PKA). It binds to the regulatory subunits of PKA, leading to the release and activation of catalytic subunits that phosphorylate target proteins. This is a well-established mechanism in cellular signaling. cAMP does not directly activate adenylate cyclase or cause Ca2+ release. The evidence supports cAMP's interaction with protein kinases and its role in PKA activation, aligning with standard biochemical consensus.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Cyclic AMP (cAMP) is a well-known secondary messenger in cellular signaling pathways. Its primary action is through the activation of protein kinase A (PKA). When cAMP levels increase within a cell, it binds to the regulatory subunits of PKA, causing a conformational change that releases the catalytic subunits. These catalytic subunits then phosphorylate various target proteins, leading to changes in cell function. This mechanism is a standard and widely accepted understanding in physiology. The option suggesting activation of adenylate cyclase by cAMP is incorrect, as adenylate cyclase is actually the enzyme responsible for the synthesis of cAMP from ATP, not a downstream target of cAMP. Additionally, cAMP does not directly cause Ca2+ release; while it may influence pathways that affect Ca2+ levels, this is not its primary or direct action. Therefore, the correct answer, based on medical consensus and the provided enhanced information, is the activation of protein kinase.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
