Hypoglycemia\nopb. Cinchonism\nopc. Arrhythmias\nopd. Sweating\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nThe most likely cause of restlessness and sweating following i.v. quinine administration is hypoglycemia. This is supported by the known side effect profile of quinine affecting glucose metabolism and evidence linking hypoglycemia to symptoms such as agitation and restlessness. Other potential causes like cinchonism and arrhythmias do not align as closely with the specific symptoms observed, and there is insufficient evidence to support quinine directly causing sweating through stimulation of sweat glands.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Quinine, a medication used primarily for the treatment of malaria, is known to have several side effects, including cinchonism, which is characterized by symptoms such as tinnitus, headache, nausea, and disturbed vision. However, the specific symptoms of restlessness and sweating following i.v. quinine administration are more indicative of hypoglycemia. Quinine can stimulate insulin release, which may lead to hypoglycemia, particularly in a fasting state or in individuals with compromised glucose regulation. Hypoglycemia is well-documented to cause symptoms such as sweating, restlessness, and agitation. While arrhythmias could also cause restlessness, they are less likely to cause sweating and are not as directly linked to quinine administration as hypoglycemia. The option of 'sweating' alone does not address the restlessness and is too nonspecific. Therefore, based on the symptoms described and the known pharmacological effects of quinine, hypoglycemia is the most likely cause of the patient's symptoms.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
