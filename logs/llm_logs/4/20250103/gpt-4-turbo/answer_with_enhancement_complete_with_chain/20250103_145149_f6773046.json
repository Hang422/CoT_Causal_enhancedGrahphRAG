Ascaris\nopb. Filariasis\nopc. Malaria\nopd. Oncocerciasis\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nIvermectin is effective against parasitic infections such as Ascaris, filariasis, and onchocerciasis. However, it is not indicated for the treatment of malaria, as malaria is caused by Plasmodium species, which are not targeted by Ivermectin. This aligns with medical consensus and the specific action mechanism of the drug.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Ivermectin is a well-known antiparasitic medication primarily used for treating several parasitic infections. According to standard medical knowledge, Ivermectin is effective against parasitic worms such as those causing Ascaris (roundworm), filariasis (caused by thread-like filarial worms), and onchocerciasis (river blindness caused by Onchocerca volvulus). These uses are well-documented and align with the drug's mechanism of action, which involves paralyzing and killing the parasites. However, malaria is caused by Plasmodium parasites, which are protozoans, not helminths (worms). Ivermectin's action does not target the life cycle of Plasmodium species, making it ineffective as a treatment for malaria. This is consistent with both the enhanced information provided and the general medical consensus.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opc\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
