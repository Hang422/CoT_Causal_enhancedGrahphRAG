Tamsulosin\nopb. Prazosin\nopc. Oxazocin\nopd. Dolazoline\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nTamsulosin, an alpha-1 adrenergic blocker, is specifically targeted and widely used for BPH treatment, effectively relaxing bladder and prostate muscles to improve urine flow and relieve symptoms. Prazosin, also an alpha-1 blocker but primarily for hypertension, is less selective and not the first choice for BPH. Oxazocin and Dolazoline are not recognized medications for BPH and have no established therapeutic roles in its management.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The question pertains to the use of alpha-1 adrenergic blockers for symptomatic relief in benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Among the options provided, Tamsulosin and Prazosin are both alpha-1 blockers. Tamsulosin is specifically targeted for BPH due to its selectivity for alpha-1A receptors found predominantly in the prostate, which makes it highly effective in relaxing bladder and prostate muscles to improve urine flow and relieve symptoms of BPH. Prazosin, while also an alpha-1 blocker, is primarily used for managing hypertension and is less selective compared to Tamsulosin, making it not the first choice for BPH. The other two options, Oxazocin and Dolazoline, do not have recognized roles in the management of BPH. Based on this analysis, Tamsulosin is the most appropriate and effective choice for providing symptomatic relief in BPH, aligning with medical consensus and clinical practice.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
