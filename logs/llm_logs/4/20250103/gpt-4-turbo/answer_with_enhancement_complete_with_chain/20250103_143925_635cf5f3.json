Drug implicated is?\n\n                    ### Options\n                    opa. Streptomycin\nopb. Isoniazid\nopc. Ethambutol\nopd. Rifampicin\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nStreptomycin, an aminoglycoside antibiotic, is well-documented for its ototoxic effects, which can damage the auditory nerve leading to deafness and tinnitus. This aligns with medical consensus and is supported by evidence paths linking Streptomycin with ototoxicity, making it the most likely cause of the patient's symptoms among the listed anti-tubercular drugs.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The primary concern here is the identification of the anti-tubercular drug causing ototoxic effects, specifically deafness and tinnitus. Among the options provided, Streptomycin is well-known for its ototoxicity, which can manifest as hearing loss and tinnitus. This aligns with the standard medical understanding and consensus about the side effects of aminoglycoside antibiotics like Streptomycin. Isoniazid, Ethambutol, and Rifampicin, while also anti-tubercular drugs, are not primarily associated with ototoxic effects to the extent seen with Streptomycin. Therefore, based on the symptoms described and the known side effects of these medications, Streptomycin is the most likely cause of the patient's auditory issues.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
