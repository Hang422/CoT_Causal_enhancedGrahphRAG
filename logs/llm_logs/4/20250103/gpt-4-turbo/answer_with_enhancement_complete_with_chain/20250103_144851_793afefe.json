Anti depressants\nopb. Anti psychotics\nopc. Anti epileptics\nopd. Mood stabilizers\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nSchizophrenia is primarily treated with antipsychotic medications, which effectively reduce psychotic symptoms by blocking dopamine receptors, addressing the neurotransmitter imbalances central to the disease. While antidepressants, mood stabilizers, and antiepileptics may be used for specific comorbid conditions or symptoms, they do not primarily impact the core psychotic symptoms of schizophrenia.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Schizophrenia is a psychiatric disorder characterized primarily by symptoms such as hallucinations, delusions, and disorganized thinking. The core treatment for schizophrenia involves the use of antipsychotic medications. These medications primarily function by modulating neurotransmitter systems, especially dopamine, to alleviate psychotic symptoms. While other medications like antidepressants, mood stabilizers, and antiepileptics can be used adjunctively to manage comorbid conditions or specific symptom clusters in schizophrenia, they do not address the primary psychotic symptoms directly. Therefore, based on standard medical knowledge and consensus, antipsychotics are the most appropriate and direct treatment for the core symptoms of schizophrenia.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
