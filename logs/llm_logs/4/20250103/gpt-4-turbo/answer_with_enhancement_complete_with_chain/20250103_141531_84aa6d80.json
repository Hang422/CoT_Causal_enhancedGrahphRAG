Reducing aqueous humor secretion\nopb. Contracting iris sphincter muscle\nopc. Increasing aqueous humor outflow\nopd. Relaxing ciliary muscle\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nPilocarpine reduces intraocular pressure in closed-angle glaucoma by contracting the iris sphincter muscle, resulting in miosis. This narrows the pupil and pulls the peripheral iris away from the trabecular meshwork, thereby increasing aqueous humor outflow. This mechanism is supported by medical consensus and directly relates to pilocarpine's pharmacological action in glaucoma treatment.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Pilocarpine is a cholinergic agonist primarily used in the treatment of glaucoma. Its mechanism of action in closed-angle glaucoma involves contracting the iris sphincter muscle, which leads to miosis (constriction of the pupil). This action effectively pulls the peripheral iris away from the trabecular meshwork, which is crucial for aqueous humor drainage. By doing so, pilocarpine facilitates the increase of aqueous humor outflow through the trabecular meshwork, thereby reducing intraocular pressure. This explanation aligns with the standard pharmacological understanding of pilocarpine's effect in closed-angle glaucoma and is supported by medical consensus.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opc\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
