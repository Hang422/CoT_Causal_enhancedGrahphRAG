Leucine\nopb. Lysine\nopc. Methionine\nopd. Proline\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nAmong the options provided, Leucine, Lysine, and Methionine are classified as essential amino acids, which means they must be obtained through the diet as the human body cannot synthesize them. Proline, on the other hand, is a non-essential amino acid because it can be synthesized by the human body. Therefore, the correct answer to the question 'Essential amino acids are all except:' is Proline. The evidence paths provided, although broad, confirm the classification of Leucine and Lysine interacting within cells, aligning with their essential nature, but do not directly impact the differentiation between essential and non-essential amino acids.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The question requires identifying the non-essential amino acid among the given options. Essential amino acids are those that the human body cannot synthesize and must be obtained through the diet. The options provided include Leucine, Lysine, Methionine, and Proline. According to standard medical knowledge, Leucine, Lysine, and Methionine are essential amino acids. Proline, however, is classified as a non-essential amino acid because the human body can synthesize it. This classification is well-supported and aligns with the consensus in biochemistry and nutrition science. Therefore, the correct answer to the question is Proline, as it is the only non-essential amino acid listed among the options.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
