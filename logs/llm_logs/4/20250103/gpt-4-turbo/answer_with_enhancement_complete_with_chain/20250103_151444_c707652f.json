Chlorothiazide\nopb. Beta blockers\nopc. ACE inhibitors\nopd. Amlodipine\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nACE inhibitors are contraindicated with spironolactone due to the increased risk of hyperkalemia from their combined effect of raising blood potassium levels. This interaction is well-documented and generally advised against unless under strict medical supervision.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Spironolactone is a potassium-sparing diuretic commonly used in the treatment of conditions like hypertension, heart failure, and hyperaldosteronism. One of the primary concerns with spironolactone is its potential to cause hyperkalemia, an elevated level of potassium in the blood, which can be dangerous. ACE inhibitors, which include drugs like lisinopril and enalapril, also have a propensity to increase blood potassium levels. When used together with spironolactone, there is a heightened risk of hyperkalemia due to the combined effects of both drugs on potassium levels. This interaction is well-documented in medical literature and clinical practice, leading to a general recommendation to avoid this combination unless under careful medical supervision and frequent monitoring of blood potassium levels. The other options, such as Chlorothiazide (a thiazide diuretic), Beta blockers, and Amlodipine (a calcium channel blocker), do not share this specific contraindication with spironolactone.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opc\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
