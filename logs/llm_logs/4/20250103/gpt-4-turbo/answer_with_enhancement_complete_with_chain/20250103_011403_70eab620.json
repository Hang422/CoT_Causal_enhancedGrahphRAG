Acute renal failure\nopb. Development of antiplatelet antibodies\nopc. Encephalitis secondary to liver dysfunction\nopd. Hemorrhagic stroke\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nFibrinolytic drugs, used in treating acute myocardial infarction, primarily act by breaking down blood clots, which increases the risk of bleeding. The most significant adverse effect associated with this mechanism is hemorrhagic stroke, as supported by evidence linking hemorrhage to hemorrhagic stroke. Other potential adverse effects like acute renal failure, antiplatelet antibodies, and encephalitis due to liver dysfunction are less directly connected to the use of fibrinolytics and are not strongly supported by medical consensus or evidence.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Fibrinolytic drugs are primarily used in the treatment of acute myocardial infarction to dissolve blood clots that are blocking blood flow to the heart. The core medical principle here is that these drugs work by breaking down fibrin, a key component of blood clots. This mechanism, while beneficial in restoring blood flow, also increases the risk of bleeding elsewhere in the body. Among the options provided, hemorrhagic stroke is the most directly related adverse effect due to this increased bleeding risk. Hemorrhagic stroke occurs when a blood vessel in the brain bursts, leading to bleeding (hemorrhage) in or around the brain. The other listed side effects, such as acute renal failure, development of antiplatelet antibodies, and encephalitis secondary to liver dysfunction, are less directly associated with the pharmacological action of fibrinolytics and are not commonly reported as major adverse effects in the context of their use for heart attacks. Therefore, based on medical consensus and the mechanism of action of fibrinolytics, hemorrhagic stroke is the most likely significant adverse effect.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}",
