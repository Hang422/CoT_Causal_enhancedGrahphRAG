Vitamin A\nopb. Vitamin B\nopc. Vitamin C\nopd. Vitamin E\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nNyctalopia, commonly known as night blindness, is primarily caused by a deficiency in Vitamin A. This deficiency leads to a reduced production of rhodopsin, a pigment essential for vision in low-light conditions. The evidence paths confirm the association between Vitamin A deficiency and disruptions in rhodopsin function, which is crucial for night vision. Other vitamins such as Vitamin B, Vitamin C, and Vitamin E deficiencies do not have a direct, well-established link to causing nyctalopia, as their deficiencies typically lead to other health issues without a direct or clear connection to impaired night vision.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Nyctalopia, also known as night blindness, is primarily associated with a deficiency in Vitamin A. This is a well-established medical fact supported by the understanding that Vitamin A is crucial for the synthesis of rhodopsin, a pigment found in the retina that is essential for low-light vision. Deficiencies in other vitamins such as Vitamin B, Vitamin C, and Vitamin E, while they may cause other health issues, do not have a direct and well-documented link to causing night blindness. Therefore, based on the consensus in medical literature and the specific role of Vitamin A in vision, the most likely correct answer is Vitamin A.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
