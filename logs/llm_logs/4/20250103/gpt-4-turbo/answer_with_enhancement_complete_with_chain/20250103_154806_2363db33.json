Liver\nopb. Adipose tissue\nopc. RBC\nopd. Brain\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nThe HMP shunt is present in the liver, brain, and adipose tissue due to their requirements for NADPH and nucleotide synthesis. However, mature red blood cells (RBCs) lack the necessary enzymes and organelles for the HMP shunt, confirming that RBCs do not have this metabolic pathway.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The HMP shunt, also known as the pentose phosphate pathway, is crucial for the production of NADPH and ribose-5-phosphate. NADPH is essential for biosynthetic reactions and maintaining the redox balance, while ribose-5-phosphate is a precursor for nucleotide synthesis. Organs like the liver, brain, and adipose tissue require these metabolic products for various functions including fatty acid synthesis (adipose tissue), cholesterol synthesis (liver), and neurotransmitter synthesis (brain). Mature red blood cells (RBCs), however, lack certain organelles such as mitochondria and nuclei, and also do not contain the full complement of metabolic enzymes required for the HMP shunt. This absence is primarily due to the specialized function of RBCs in oxygen transport rather than cellular biosynthesis or detoxification. Therefore, based on the standard medical knowledge and the enhanced information provided, RBCs do not participate in the HMP shunt pathway.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opc\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
