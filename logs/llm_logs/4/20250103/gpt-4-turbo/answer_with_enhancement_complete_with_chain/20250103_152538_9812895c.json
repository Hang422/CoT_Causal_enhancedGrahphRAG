Amyloidosis associated with multiple myeloma has the poorest prognosis\nopb. Fine - needle biopsy of subcutaneous abdominal fat is a simple & reliable method for diagnosing secondary systemic amyloidosis\nopc. Hepatic amyloid disease produces hepatomegaly but rarely jaundice\nopd. Amyloidosis of the spleen is associated with severe anemia\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nAmong the provided statements about amyloidosis, the claim that amyloidosis of the spleen is associated with severe anemia is false. Splenic amyloidosis typically causes splenomegaly but does not directly lead to severe anemia, which is more commonly due to other complications such as renal failure or bone marrow involvement. Other statements align well with medical consensus, noting that the prognosis of amyloidosis associated with multiple myeloma, while poor, is not definitively the poorest without specific comparative data.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Analyzing the provided options concerning amyloidosis: Option A states that amyloidosis associated with multiple myeloma has the poorest prognosis. This is generally true as amyloidosis linked with multiple myeloma often leads to severe organ dysfunction, but it's important to note that 'poorest' is a relative term and depends on comparisons with other specific conditions. Option B mentions that a fine-needle biopsy of subcutaneous abdominal fat is a reliable method for diagnosing secondary systemic amyloidosis, which aligns with medical practices as this method is commonly used due to its simplicity and effectiveness. Option C states that hepatic amyloid disease typically results in hepatomegaly but rarely causes jaundice, which is accurate because amyloid deposits in the liver usually do not disrupt liver function to the extent of causing jaundice. Option D claims that amyloidosis of the spleen is associated with severe anemia. This is not typically true as splenic amyloidosis primarily causes splenomegaly and does not directly lead to severe anemia; severe anemia in amyloidosis is more likely related to other complications such as renal failure or bone marrow involvement. Therefore, the statement in Option D is the least accurate and aligns with the query for the statement that is 'not true' concerning amyloidosis.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
