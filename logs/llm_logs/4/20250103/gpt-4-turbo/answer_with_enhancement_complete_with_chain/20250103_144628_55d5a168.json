Spectrin\nopb. Ankyrin\nopc. Tubulin\nopd. Laminin\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nAnkyrin is the correct answer as it directly binds the plasma membrane to the cytoskeleton. It achieves this by linking integral membrane proteins to spectrin, which then connects to actin filaments of the cytoskeleton. This role is well-established in cellular biology and supported by evidence paths showing interactions between ankyrin and spectrin.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The question focuses on the connection between the plasma membrane and the cytoskeleton within a cell. The plasma membrane is crucial for maintaining the structural integrity of the cell and facilitating communication and transport between the cell and its external environment. The cytoskeleton provides structural support and facilitates intracellular transport and cellular movements. The connection between these two components is vital for cellular function. Among the options provided, Ankyrin is known to play a direct role in linking the plasma membrane to the cytoskeleton. It does this by binding to integral membrane proteins and connecting them to spectrin, which in turn is associated with actin filaments of the cytoskeleton. This role of Ankyrin is well-documented in cellular biology, making it the most likely correct answer based on medical consensus and the enhanced information provided.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
