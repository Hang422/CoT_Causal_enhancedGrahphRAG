Duodenum\nopb. Ileum\nopc. Jejunum\nopd. Colon\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nVitamin B12, when combined with intrinsic factor, is absorbed in the ileum of the small intestine. This absorption is facilitated by specific receptors present in the ileum, aligning with the medical consensus and supported by evidence paths highlighting the role of the ileum in the uptake process and its physiological functions.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The absorption of Vitamin B12, when combined with intrinsic factor, is a well-documented physiological process that occurs in the ileum of the small intestine. This is supported by standard medical knowledge which states that the ileum contains specific receptors that facilitate the absorption of Vitamin B12 bound to intrinsic factor. The other segments of the small intestine, such as the duodenum and jejunum, and the colon, do not play a significant role in this specific absorption process. Therefore, based on the consensus and the enhanced information provided, the ileum is the correct answer.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
