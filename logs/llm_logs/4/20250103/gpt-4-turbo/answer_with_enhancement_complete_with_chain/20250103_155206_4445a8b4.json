Quinine\nopb. Chloroquine\nopc. Mefloquine\nopd. Atovaquone\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nChloroquine is known to accumulate in the retina and cause retinal toxicity, which can lead to retinal pigmentation. This is supported by medical consensus and aligns with the evidence path indicating Chloroquine's interaction with the retina. Quinine, Mefloquine, and Atovaquone, while used in malaria treatment, do not have documented evidence linking them to retinal pigmentation, and thus are unlikely to cause this condition. The evidence paths for these drugs do not provide relevant information regarding retinal pigmentation.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The question pertains to the identification of a drug that causes retinal pigmentation. Among the options provided, Chloroquine is well-documented in medical literature for its potential to cause retinal toxicity, which includes retinal pigmentation as a possible outcome. This condition is often referred to as Chloroquine retinopathy. The other drugs listed - Quinine, Mefloquine, and Atovaquone - are also used in the treatment of malaria but do not have strong associations with retinal pigmentation based on current medical consensus and available literature. Therefore, based on the evidence and the known side effects of these medications, Chloroquine is the most likely to cause retinal pigmentation.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
