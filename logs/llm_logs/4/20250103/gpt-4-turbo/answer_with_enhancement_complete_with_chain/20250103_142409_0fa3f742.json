Thiamine\nopb. Pyridoxine\nopc. Niacin\nopd. Riboflavin\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nIsoniazid (INH) causes neuropathy by interfering with pyridoxine (vitamin B6) metabolism, leading to its deficiency and resulting in peripheral neuropathy. The standard treatment for INH-induced neuropathy is pyridoxine supplementation, which restores normal nerve function and alleviates symptoms. This is supported by both medical consensus and direct evidence paths linking pyridoxine treatment to neuropathy alleviation.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Isoniazid (INH), a commonly used antitubercular medication, is known to cause peripheral neuropathy as a side effect. This neuropathy is primarily due to the interference of INH with the metabolism of pyridoxine (vitamin B6), leading to a deficiency. The standard medical treatment for preventing or treating INH-induced neuropathy involves the supplementation of pyridoxine. This approach is well-supported by medical literature and clinical practice, aligning with the consensus that pyridoxine supplementation can effectively restore normal nerve function and alleviate symptoms of neuropathy caused by INH. Other vitamins listed, such as Thiamine, Niacin, and Riboflavin, do not directly address the specific mechanism by which INH induces neuropathy.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
