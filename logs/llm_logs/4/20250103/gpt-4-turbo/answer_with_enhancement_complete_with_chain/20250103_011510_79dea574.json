Which of the following enzymes is defective?\n\n                    ### Options\n                    opa. Fructokinase\nopb. Aldolase A\nopc. Aldolase B\nopd. Sucrase\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nThe symptoms of vomiting, lethargy, and severe jaundice in a 6-month-old baby following the introduction of fruit juice are indicative of Aldolase B deficiency. This enzyme is crucial in the metabolism of fructose, and its deficiency leads to the accumulation of toxic metabolites that can cause liver dysfunction, hypoglycemia, and gastrointestinal disturbances. This aligns with the known medical consensus on hereditary fructose intolerance caused by Aldolase B deficiency.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The symptoms described in the scenario - vomiting, lethargy, and severe jaundice following the introduction of fruit juice - are characteristic of hereditary fructose intolerance (HFI). HFI is a condition where the body lacks the enzyme Aldolase B, which is essential for the proper metabolism of fructose. The deficiency of Aldolase B leads to the accumulation of fructose-1-phosphate in the liver, kidney, and small intestine, causing severe hypoglycemia and liver dysfunction, which are reflected in the symptoms of jaundice and lethargy. The other enzymes listed, such as Fructokinase, Aldolase A, and Sucrase, do not lead to these specific symptoms when deficient. Fructokinase deficiency results in essential fructosuria, a benign condition. Aldolase A deficiency affects glycolysis but is not typically associated with fructose ingestion. Sucrase deficiency would lead to sucrose intolerance symptoms, not fructose intolerance. Therefore, based on the symptoms and the timing with fruit juice introduction, Aldolase B deficiency is the most likely cause.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opc\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
