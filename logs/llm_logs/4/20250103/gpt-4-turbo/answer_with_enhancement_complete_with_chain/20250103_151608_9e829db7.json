Streptomycin\nopb. Ethambutol\nopc. Capreomycin\nopd. Rifampicin\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nRifampicin is the safest antitubercular drug for use in severe renal failure due to its primary metabolism by the liver, minimizing renal stress. Ethambutol may be used with careful dose adjustments and monitoring. Streptomycin and Capreomycin are not recommended due to their primary renal excretion and associated high toxicity risk in renal failure.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"In addressing the question of which antitubercular drug can be safely used in severe renal failure, it is crucial to consider the pharmacokinetics of each drug. Rifampicin is primarily metabolized by the liver, which makes it a safer choice in patients with severe renal failure as it minimizes the burden on the kidneys. Ethambutol could potentially be used but requires careful dose adjustments and monitoring due to its partial renal excretion. Streptomycin and Capreomycin, on the other hand, are primarily excreted by the kidneys and are associated with a higher risk of toxicity in patients with renal impairment. Therefore, based on the standard medical knowledge and the enhanced information provided, Rifampicin is the most appropriate choice among the options given.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
