Hyponatremia\nopb. Hyperkalemia\nopc. Hypoglycemia\nopd. Metabolic alkalosis\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nAdrenal insufficiency leads to hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, and hypoglycemia due to decreased production of aldosterone and cortisol. It is not associated with metabolic alkalosis, as it typically causes metabolic acidosis instead.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "### Core Medical Principle:\nAdrenal insufficiency, such as Addison's disease, involves the underproduction of hormones like cortisol and aldosterone by the adrenal glands. This condition has specific effects on electrolyte balance and metabolism.\n\n### Analysis:\n- **Hyponatremia (opa)**: Adrenal insufficiency leads to a decrease in aldosterone, which helps regulate sodium and water balance. Reduced aldosterone levels result in decreased sodium reabsorption, leading to hyponatremia.\n- **Hyperkalemia (opb)**: Similarly, with decreased aldosterone, there is less secretion of potassium, resulting in hyperkalemia.\n- **Hypoglycemia (opc)**: Cortisol, another hormone produced by the adrenal glands, has gluconeogenic effects (i.e., it helps in the production of glucose). In adrenal insufficiency, reduced cortisol levels lead to hypoglycemia.\n- **Metabolic alkalosis (opd)**: Adrenal insufficiency typically leads to metabolic acidosis, not alkalosis, due to the accumulation of acids in the body when aldosterone is deficient. Aldosterone normally helps in the excretion of hydrogen ions; its deficiency leads to acidosis.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBased on the standard medical knowledge and the effects of hormone deficiencies in adrenal insufficiency, metabolic alkalosis is not typically associated with this condition. Instead, metabolic acidosis is more common. Therefore, the correct answer to the question is that adrenal insufficiency is not associated with metabolic alkalosis.\n\n### Final Output:\n```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Adrenal insufficiency leads to electrolyte imbalances and metabolic changes due to decreased production of aldosterone and cortisol. It is associated with hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, and hypoglycemia, and typically results in metabolic acidosis rather than alkalosis. Thus, metabolic alkalosis is not associated with adrenal insufficiency.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
