Krabbe's disease\nopb. Fabry's disease\nopc. Fragile syndrome\nopd. All\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nKrabbe's disease, Fabry's disease, and Fragile X syndrome are not glycogen storage diseases. Krabbe's and Fabry's are lysosomal storage disorders, involving different biochemical pathways than those affected in glycogen storage diseases. Fragile X syndrome is a genetic disorder linked to the X chromosome and does not involve glycogen metabolism. Therefore, the correct answer is 'All,' as none of these conditions are glycogen storage diseases.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Glycogen storage diseases are a group of disorders that involve the storage and mobilization of glycogen. Krabbe's disease and Fabry's disease are classified as lysosomal storage disorders, which involve the accumulation of different substances within the lysosome due to enzyme deficiencies, not specifically related to glycogen. Fragile X syndrome is a genetic disorder associated with the X chromosome and involves changes in the FMR1 gene, affecting neurological development and function, but it does not involve glycogen metabolism. Therefore, none of the conditions listed in the options are glycogen storage diseases. The enhanced information provided aligns with standard medical knowledge, confirming that all the listed options are not glycogen storage diseases.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 100\n}",
