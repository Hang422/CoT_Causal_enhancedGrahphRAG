Ca transporter\nopb. Cu transporter\nopc. Zn transporter\nopd. Se transporter\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nMenkes Kinky Hair Syndrome is caused by a genetic defect in the ATP7A gene, leading to impaired copper transport. This defect results in symptoms such as brittle, kinky hair, developmental delays, and neurological issues due to copper deficiency. The syndrome is hereditary, aligning with evidence paths that highlight its genetic and symptomatic characteristics.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Menkes Kinky Hair Syndrome is a genetic disorder characterized by a defect in copper transport, specifically due to mutations in the ATP7A gene. This gene encodes a protein that is essential for the proper transport of copper in the body. The impaired copper transport leads to various symptoms including brittle, kinky hair, developmental delays, and neurological issues. The information provided aligns well with established medical knowledge about the syndrome, confirming that the defect is in the copper transporter, not in calcium, zinc, or selenium transporters.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 98\n}",
