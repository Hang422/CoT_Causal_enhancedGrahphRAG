Glucocoicoids\nopb. Mineralcoicoids\nopc. Aldosterone\nopd. Androgens\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nThe zona reticularis of the adrenal cortex primarily secretes androgens, which are a type of steroid hormone. This is supported by the evidence that the zona reticularis is known for synthesizing dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), a precursor to androgens. The retrieved evidence paths confirm that the zona reticularis is a location of androgen production and that DHEA is an androgen. This aligns with the medical consensus that the innermost layer of the adrenal cortex, the zona reticularis, is primarily involved in the production of sex steroids, specifically androgens.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The zona reticularis is the innermost layer of the adrenal cortex and is primarily responsible for the production of androgens, which are sex hormones. This is supported by standard medical knowledge that identifies dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) as a key androgen produced in this region. DHEA serves as a precursor to more potent androgens such as testosterone. The other options presented, such as glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids (specifically aldosterone), are primarily secreted by the zona fasciculata and zona glomerulosa of the adrenal cortex, respectively. Therefore, based on the consensus and the specific role of the zona reticularis in androgen production, the correct answer is that the major hormone secreted by this zone is androgens.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
