Stroma\nopb. Corpora albicans\nopc. Corpora lutea\nopd. Mature follicles\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nProgesterone production in the ovary is primarily by the corpora lutea. Following ovulation, the corpus luteum forms from the remnants of the ruptured follicle and is crucial for progesterone production, which is essential for maintaining the early stages of pregnancy. This is supported by the evidence path linking the structure of the corpus luteum directly to progesterone production. In contrast, mature follicles, while involved in hormone production, primarily focus on estrogen and have less involvement in progesterone production compared to the corpora lutea. The corpora albicans, which are the degenerated remains of the corpus luteum, have significantly reduced hormonal activity and thus contribute minimally to progesterone production. The ovarian stroma, being mainly a structural component, plays a minor role in hormone production overall. Therefore, the most accurate answer to the question is that the corpora lutea are the primary site of progesterone production in the ovary.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Progesterone is a key hormone in the female reproductive system, primarily involved in preparing and maintaining the uterus for pregnancy. After ovulation, the corpus luteum forms from the remnants of the ruptured follicle. This structure is crucial for the production of progesterone during the early stages of pregnancy. The corpora lutea's primary function is to secrete progesterone, which is essential for maintaining the uterine lining and supporting early pregnancy. In contrast, mature follicles mainly produce estrogen, which is pivotal before ovulation but not the primary source of progesterone. The corpora albicans, which are the degenerated remains of the corpus luteum, do not significantly contribute to hormone production, including progesterone. Similarly, the ovarian stroma, primarily providing structural support, plays a minimal role in hormone production. Based on standard medical knowledge and the consensus in reproductive physiology, the corpora lutea are indeed the primary site for progesterone production in the ovary.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opc\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
