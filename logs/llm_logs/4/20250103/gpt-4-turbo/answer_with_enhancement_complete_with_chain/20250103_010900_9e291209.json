Directly\nopb. IG1-1\nopc. Thyroxine\nopd. Intranuclear receptors\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nGrowth hormone primarily influences growth through the stimulation of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1). GH binds to its receptor, activates the JAK-STAT signaling pathway, leading to the transcription of IGF-1 genes in the liver, and the secretion of IGF-1 into the bloodstream. IGF-1 then promotes growth in various tissues. Other mechanisms like direct effects on muscle or interactions with intranuclear receptors are less supported and not the primary pathways for GH's growth effects.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Growth hormone (GH) primarily exerts its effects on growth through the stimulation of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), which is a well-established pathway in endocrinology. Upon GH binding to its receptor on target cells, it activates the JAK-STAT signaling pathway. This activation leads to the transcription of IGF-1 genes predominantly in the liver. The liver then secretes IGF-1 into the bloodstream, where it acts on various tissues to promote growth. This mechanism is supported by a broad consensus in the medical community and is considered the primary pathway through which GH influences growth. Other suggested mechanisms, such as direct effects of GH or interactions with intranuclear receptors, do not play a primary role in GH-mediated growth effects according to current understanding.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
