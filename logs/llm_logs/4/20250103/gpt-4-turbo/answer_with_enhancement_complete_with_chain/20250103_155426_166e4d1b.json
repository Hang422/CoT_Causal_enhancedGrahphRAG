Discoid lupus erythematous\nopb. Rheumatoid ahritis\nopc. Infectious mononucleosis\nopd. All of the above\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nChloroquine is effective in treating Discoid Lupus Erythematosus and Rheumatoid Arthritis due to its immune-modulating and anti-inflammatory properties. It is not effective for Infectious Mononucleosis, making the option 'All of the above' incorrect. The medication's role is well-supported in the treatment of autoimmune conditions but not in viral infections like infectious mononucleosis.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Chloroquine is primarily known for its use in treating malaria, but it also has applications in managing autoimmune diseases due to its anti-inflammatory and immune-modulating properties. Specifically, it is used in the treatment of Discoid Lupus Erythematosus (DLE) and Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). Both conditions benefit from chloroquine's ability to reduce inflammation and modulate the immune system. However, Chloroquine is not effective in treating viral infections such as Infectious Mononucleosis, which is caused by the Epstein-Barr virus. Therefore, while chloroquine is useful for both DLE and RA, it is not applicable for all the options listed, particularly not for Infectious Mononucleosis. Based on this understanding, the correct answer is that chloroquine is useful in treating both Discoid Lupus Erythematosus and Rheumatoid Arthritis.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}",
