Imiquimod\nopb. Podophylline\nopc. Interferon\nopd. Acyclovir\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nImiquimod is the most appropriate topical immunomodulator for the treatment of genital warts, as it activates the immune system and enhances cytokine production to eliminate HPV-infected cells. This aligns with medical consensus and is supported by its specific action on the immune system relevant to HPV infection.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The question pertains to the identification of a topical immunomodulator used for the treatment of genital warts. Among the options provided, Imiquimod (opa) is recognized as a topical immunomodulator that activates the immune system to target HPV-infected cells, which is the causative agent of genital warts. This mechanism of action is consistent with the role of an immunomodulator in enhancing the body's immune response against the virus. Podophylline (opb) is used topically for genital warts but functions primarily as a cytotoxic agent rather than an immunomodulator. Interferon (opc) can be used in some cases but is typically administered through injections rather than as a topical treatment. Acyclovir (opd) is an antiviral medication effective against herpes viruses, not HPV. Therefore, based on the standard medical knowledge and the specific action of the drugs, Imiquimod is the most appropriate choice for a topical immunomodulator in the treatment of genital warts.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
