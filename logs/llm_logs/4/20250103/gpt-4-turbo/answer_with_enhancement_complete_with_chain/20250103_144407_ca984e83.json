Single dose in ascariasis\nopb. Immunostimulant\nopc. Paralysis of worms by depolarisation\nopd. Immunodepressant in high doses\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nLevamisole is effectively used as an anthelmintic for ascariasis, often in single doses, and acts as an immunostimulant by enhancing immune responses. It paralyzes worms through depolarization of muscle membranes. However, its use as an immunodepressant at high doses is not supported by strong evidence or consensus, making it the correct answer to the query about its non-uses.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "### Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\n1. **Understanding Levamisole's Uses**:\n   - **Single Dose in Ascariasis**: Levamisole is known to be effective as an anthelmintic, particularly for treating ascariasis. It is commonly administered in a single dose for this purpose.\n   - **Immunostimulant**: Levamisole has been documented to act as an immunostimulant. It enhances various aspects of the immune response, which is beneficial in certain clinical scenarios.\n   - **Paralysis of Worms by Depolarization**: The mechanism by which levamisole acts as an anthelmintic involves the depolarization of muscle membranes in worms, leading to their paralysis and eventual death.\n\n2. **Evaluating the Controversial Use**:\n   - **Immunodepressant in High Doses**: The claim that levamisole acts as an immunodepressant at high doses is not widely supported by medical literature or clinical practice. While some drugs can have immunosuppressive effects at higher doses, specific evidence pointing to levamisole having such a dual role (both as an immunostimulant and an immunodepressant) is lacking or not robust.\n\n3. **Consensus and Medical Literature**:\n   - The majority of reliable medical sources and literature support the use of levamisole as an anthelmintic, an immunostimulant, and for its mechanism involving depolarization of worm muscle membranes. The notion of it being an immunodepressant at high doses does not align well with the consensus or widely accepted pharmacological profiles.\n\n### Final Analysis and Confidence Score\nBased on the available evidence and medical consensus, the most likely correct answer is that levamisole is not used as an \"Immunodepressant in high doses.\" This option does not align with the standard medical understanding and usage of levamisole. The confidence in this conclusion is relatively high due to the clear support for the other uses and the lack of evidence for this particular claim.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Levamisole is well-documented as an effective treatment for ascariasis, an immunostimulant, and works by causing paralysis of worms through depolarization.
