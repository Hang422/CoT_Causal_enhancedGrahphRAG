Loxatidine\nopb. Pirenzepine\nopc. Omeprazole\nopd. Famotidine\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nOmeprazole is the only drug among the options that blocks both basal and stimulated gastric acid secretion without affecting cholinergic, histaminergic, or gastrin receptors. It acts by inhibiting the H+/K+ ATPase enzyme system at the secretory surface of gastric parietal cells, which is a mechanism distinct from those involving the specified receptors. The evidence paths, while broad, support its classification and mechanism of action as a proton pump inhibitor, aligning with medical consensus on its effects on gastric acid secretion.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The question requires identifying a drug that inhibits both basal and stimulated gastric acid secretion without affecting cholinergic, histaminergic, or gastrin receptors. Among the options provided, Omeprazole is the only drug that fits this description. Omeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) that works by blocking the H+/K+ ATPase enzyme system in the gastric parietal cells. This action reduces the secretion of gastric acid by inhibiting the final step in acid production, thus affecting both basal and stimulated secretion. The other drugs listed, such as Loxatidine, Pirenzepine, and Famotidine, do not share this mechanism. Pirenzepine targets cholinergic receptors, and Famotidine is a histamine H2 receptor antagonist, both differing from the requirement to not affect cholinergic, histaminergic, or gastrin receptors. Therefore, based on the mechanism of action and the specific requirements of the question, Omeprazole is the correct choice.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opc\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
