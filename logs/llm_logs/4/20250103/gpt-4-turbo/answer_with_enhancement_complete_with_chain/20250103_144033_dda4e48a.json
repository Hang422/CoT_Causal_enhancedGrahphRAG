Produced by alpha cells of pancreas\nopb. Two polypeptide chains are bound by disulfide linkages\nopc. Shifts potassium outside the cell\nopd. S.c insulin tl/2 is 60 mins\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nThe only true statement regarding insulin among the options is that it consists of two polypeptide chains bound by disulfide linkages. Insulin is produced by beta cells of the pancreas, not alpha cells, and it facilitates the uptake of potassium into cells, contrary to shifting it outside. The half-life of subcutaneously administered insulin is approximately 5-6 minutes, not 60 minutes.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Analyzing the provided options about insulin, we can determine the correct answer based on standard medical knowledge. Insulin is indeed produced by the beta cells of the pancreas, not the alpha cells, which produce glucagon, thus eliminating option 'opa'. Regarding option 'opc', insulin actually promotes the uptake of potassium into the cells rather than shifting it outside, making this statement incorrect. For option 'opd', the half-life of subcutaneously administered insulin is much shorter, approximately 5-6 minutes, not 60 minutes, which disqualifies this option as well. The correct statement is option 'opb', which states that insulin consists of two polypeptide chains bound by disulfide linkages. This is a well-established fact in biochemistry, confirming the structure of insulin as a hormone crucial for glucose metabolism.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
