Proprioception\nopb. Vibratory sense\nopc. Heat sensation\nopd. Touch\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nThe dorsal columns of the spinal cord are responsible for carrying proprioception, vibratory sense, and fine touch. Heat sensation, however, is transmitted via the spinothalamic tract and is not carried by the dorsal columns. The reasoning chains for proprioception, vibratory sense, and touch align with medical consensus, while the chain for heat sensation correctly identifies it as not associated with the dorsal columns.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The dorsal columns of the spinal cord are primarily responsible for carrying sensory modalities such as proprioception, vibratory sense, and fine touch. These functions are well-documented in medical literature and align with the consensus in neurophysiology. Proprioception involves the sense of the relative position of one's own body parts and strength of effort being employed in movement. Vibratory sense refers to the ability to perceive vibrations through mechanoreceptors. Touch, particularly fine touch, involves the perception of stimuli that contact the skin in a more detailed manner. On the other hand, heat sensation is transmitted through the spinothalamic tract, not the dorsal columns. This distinction is crucial and well-supported by neuroanatomical evidence. Therefore, the option that correctly identifies a function not carried by the dorsal columns is heat sensation.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opc\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
