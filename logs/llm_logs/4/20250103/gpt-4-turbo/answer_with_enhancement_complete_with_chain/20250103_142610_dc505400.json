Imipramine\nopb. Fluvoxamine\nopc. Phenelzine\nopd. Bupropion\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nImipramine, a tricyclic antidepressant, is known to have anticholinergic effects which can increase bladder capacity and reduce bedwetting, making it effective for the treatment of nocturnal enuresis. This aligns with medical consensus and is supported by its classification and interaction within the group of tricyclic antidepressants. Other options such as Fluvoxamine (an SSRI), Phenelzine (an MAOI), and Bupropion (an NDRI) lack significant anticholinergic effects and are not effective for treating nocturnal enuresis, consistent with their pharmacological profiles.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The question pertains to the use of an antidepressant drug for the treatment of nocturnal enuresis (bedwetting). Among the options provided, Imipramine is a tricyclic antidepressant known for its anticholinergic effects, which can increase bladder capacity and decrease the frequency of bedwetting. This aligns with its known pharmacological effects and its use in clinical practice for this condition. The other drugs listed - Fluvoxamine, Phenelzine, and Bupropion - do not have significant anticholinergic effects and are not typically used for treating nocturnal enuresis. Therefore, based on medical consensus and pharmacological profiles, Imipramine is the correct choice for treating nocturnal enuresis.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
