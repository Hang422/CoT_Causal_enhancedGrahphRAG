Fatty acids\nopb. Ketone bodies\nopc. Glucose\nopd. Any of the above\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nUnder normal conditions, the primary source of energy for cardiac muscle is fatty acids. This is supported by the evidence path linking myocardium location to fatty acid metabolism. While cardiac muscle can also utilize glucose and ketone bodies, these are not the predominant sources under normal conditions. Glucose is indeed metabolized by the heart, but it is secondary to fatty acids. Ketone bodies are typically used under conditions of fasting or low carbohydrate intake, making them a less likely primary source in normal conditions. Therefore, the most accurate answer is that fatty acids are the main energy source for cardiac muscle under typical conditions.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The heart primarily uses fatty acids as its main source of energy under normal conditions. This is a well-established fact in biochemistry and cardiology, supported by numerous studies that show the myocardium's preference for fatty acid metabolism. While the heart can also metabolize glucose and, to a lesser extent, ketone bodies, these sources are secondary and more prominent under specific conditions such as high-intensity exercise or fasting, respectively. The enhanced information provided aligns with this consensus, reinforcing that under typical conditions, fatty acids are the predominant energy source for cardiac muscle. Therefore, the selection of fatty acids as the primary energy source for the heart in normal conditions is based on a strong consensus in the medical community.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
