Stomach\nopb. Duodenum\nopc. Ileum\nopd. Duodenum + Jejunum\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nIron is primarily absorbed in the duodenum, with some absorption also occurring in the jejunum. The stomach facilitates the conversion of iron into a soluble form but is not a site of significant absorption. The ileum plays a minimal role in iron absorption. The best supported options for where iron is absorbed are the duodenum and duodenum + jejunum, with the duodenum being the most critical site.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Iron absorption primarily occurs in the duodenum, which is well-supported by standard medical knowledge. The duodenum is the initial section of the small intestine immediately following the stomach, where it is most efficient at absorbing iron, particularly in its ferrous form. While some absorption can also occur in the jejunum, the next part of the small intestine, the majority of the absorption happens in the duodenum. The option 'Duodenum + Jejunum' also acknowledges absorption in the jejunum, but the critical and most significant site remains the duodenum. Given that the duodenum is explicitly mentioned in both relevant options but is the primary site, the best-supported option focusing on the primary absorption site is the most accurate. Therefore, the option 'Duodenum' is selected as it directly points to the primary site of iron absorption.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}",
