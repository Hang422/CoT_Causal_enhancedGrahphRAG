Xylose\nopb. Mannose\nopc. Glucose\nopd. Ribose\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nGlucose is the only sugar normally absorbed in the intestine against a concentration gradient. This absorption process is mediated by active transport mechanisms, specifically involving sodium-glucose transport proteins (SGLT1), which require energy in the form of ATP. This is consistent with the physiological consensus that active transport is necessary for moving substances against their concentration gradient. The evidence paths mentioning glucose's role in intestinal metabolism and its energy requirements during respiration support this understanding, as active transport is an energy-dependent process. Other sugars like xylose, mannose, and ribose are absorbed via passive or facilitated diffusion, which do not work against a concentration gradient and thus do not require energy input.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The question pertains to the absorption of sugars in the intestine, specifically focusing on which sugar is absorbed against a concentration gradient. The core medical principle involved here is the mechanism of sugar absorption via active transport versus passive or facilitated diffusion. Active transport is a process that requires energy to move substances from an area of lower concentration to an area of higher concentration, which is against the concentration gradient. Among the options provided - xylose, mannose, glucose, and ribose - glucose is well-documented in medical literature as being absorbed in the intestine through active transport mechanisms. This process is facilitated by sodium-glucose transport proteins (SGLT1), which utilize ATP as an energy source to transport glucose against its concentration gradient. The other sugars listed, such as xylose, mannose, and ribose, are typically absorbed through passive or facilitated diffusion, which do not require energy and do not move substances against a concentration gradient. Therefore, based on standard medical knowledge and the consensus in physiological literature, glucose is the correct answer.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opc\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
