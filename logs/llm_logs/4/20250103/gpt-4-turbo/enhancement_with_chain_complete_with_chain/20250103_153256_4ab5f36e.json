      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        The 5α reductase inhibitor that has been found to be effective both in benign prostatic hypertrophy and male pattern baldness is:\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Flutamide\nopb. Finasteride\nopc. Prazosin\nopd. Minoxidil\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"5α reductase inhibitor\" -> \"reduces conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT)\" -> \"decreases prostate gland size\" -> \"effective in benign prostatic hypertrophy\" -> \"Finasteride\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"5α reductase inhibitor\" -> \"reduces conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT)\" -> \"decreases DHT in scalp hair follicles\" -> \"slows hair loss in male pattern baldness\" -> \"Finasteride\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Flutamide\" -> \"nonsteroidal antiandrogen\" -> \"blocks androgen receptors\" -> \"not a 5α reductase inhibitor\" -> \"ineffective reasoning for benign prostatic hypertrophy and male pattern baldness via 5α reductase inhibition\" -> 10%\nCHAIN: \"Prazosin\" -> \"alpha-1 adrenergic receptor blocker\" -> \"used to treat hypertension and facilitate urinary flow in benign prostatic hypertrophy\" -> \"not a 5α reductase inhibitor\" -> \"ineffective reasoning for male pattern baldness via 5α reductase inhibition\" -> 10%\nCHAIN: \"Minoxidil\" -> \"vasodilator\" -> \"used to treat hypertension and promote hair growth\" -> \"not a 5α reductase inhibitor\" -> \"ineffective reasoning for benign prostatic hypertrophy via 5α reductase inhibition\" -> 10%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Stanolone)-CAUSES->(Androgenetic Alopecia)\n(Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia)-PREDISPOSES->(Complication)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Genes)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Finasteride)\n(Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia)-CAUSES->(Obstruction)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Genes)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Finasteride)\n(Androgenetic Alopecia)-PREDISPOSES->(Atherosclerosis)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Genes)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Finasteride)\n(Androgenetic Alopecia)-PREDISPOSES->(Insulin Resistance)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Genes)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Finasteride)\n(Alopecia)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Genes)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Finasteride)\n(Alopecia)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(KLK3 gene|KLK3)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Finasteride)\n(Stanolone)-CAUSES->(paracrine)-PROCESS_OF->(Prostate)\n(Stanolone)-CAUSES->(Immunity)-PROCESS_OF->(Prostate)\n(Stanolone)-CAUSES->(uptake)-PROCESS_OF->(Prostate)\n(Testosterone)-CAUSES->(Cytoprotection)-PROCESS_OF->(Prostate)\n(Testosterone)-CAUSES->(physiological aspects)-PROCESS_OF->(Prostate)\n(Testosterone)-CAUSES->(Physiological Processes)-PROCESS_OF->(Prostate)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Finasteride is the correct answer as it is a 5α reductase inhibitor that effectively reduces the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT). This reduction in DHT levels leads to a decrease in prostate gland size, making it effective in treating benign prostatic hypertrophy. Additionally, the reduction of DHT in scalp hair follicles helps slow hair loss in male pattern baldness. The evidence paths confirm the interaction of Finasteride with genes associated with both benign prostatic hyperplasia and androgenetic alopecia, supporting its dual effectiveness. Other options such as Flutamide, Prazosin, and Minoxidil do not function as 5α reductase inhibitors and are therefore not effective for both conditions through this mechanism.\"\n}",
