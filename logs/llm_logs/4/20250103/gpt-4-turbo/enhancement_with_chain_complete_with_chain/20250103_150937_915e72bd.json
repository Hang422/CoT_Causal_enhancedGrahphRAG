      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Physiology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Which is not secreted by stomach?\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Lipase\nopb. Pepsinogens\nopc. HCI\nopd. None\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Stomach\" -> \"secretes lipase\" -> \"lipase is secreted by stomach\" -> 0%\nCHAIN: \"Stomach\" -> \"secretes pepsinogens\" -> \"pepsinogens are secreted by stomach\" -> 0%\nCHAIN: \"Stomach\" -> \"secretes HCl\" -> \"HCl is secreted by stomach\" -> 0%\nCHAIN: \"Stomach\" -> \"secretes lipase, pepsinogens, HCl\" -> \"None of the options is not secreted by stomach\" -> \"None is incorrect\" -> 0%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Lipase)-CAUSES->(Fat absorption)-PROCESS_OF->(Stomach)\n(Stomach)-LOCATION_OF->(Pathogenesis)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Lipase)\n(Stomach)-LOCATION_OF->(Fatty degeneration)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Lipase)\n(Stomach)-LOCATION_OF->(Hypertrophy)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Pepsinogens)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "### Enhanced Information Analysis:\n\n1. **Lipase Secretion by Stomach**:\n   - **Consensus**: The stomach secretes a small amount of gastric lipase, which is involved in the digestion of lipids, although its contribution is minor compared to pancreatic lipase.\n   - **Evidence Paths**: The paths linking lipase with processes in the stomach (like fat absorption) support the fact that lipase is indeed secreted by the stomach, albeit not as the primary lipase for fat digestion.\n   - **Conclusion**: The chain correctly states that lipase is secreted by the stomach.\n\n2. **Pepsinogens Secretion by Stomach**:\n   - **Consensus**: Pepsinogens are indeed secreted by the stomach's chief cells and are precursors to the enzyme pepsin, which is crucial for protein digestion.\n   - **Evidence Paths**: The path linking pepsinogens with hypertrophy in the stomach does not directly support the secretion but does not contradict it either.\n   - **Conclusion**: The chain correctly states that pepsinogens are secreted by the stomach.\n\n3. **HCl Secretion by Stomach**:\n   - **Consensus**: Hydrochloric acid (HCl) is secreted by the parietal cells of the stomach and is essential for creating an acidic environment, which helps in food digestion and pepsin activation.\n   - **Evidence Paths**: No specific paths provided for HCl, but the consensus is strong and well-established in medical literature.\n   - **Conclusion**: The chain correctly states that HCl is secreted by the stomach.\n\n4. **Option Analysis (None)**:\n   - **Consensus**: Since lipase, pepsinogens, and HCl are all secreted by the stomach, the option stating \"None\" (implying none of these are secreted by the stomach) is incorrect.\n   - **Evidence Paths**: The paths provided do not directly address this option, but the individual confirmations for each substance support the incorrectness of this option.\n   - **Conclusion**: The chain correctly identifies that \"None\" is an incorrect option as all listed substances are secreted by the stomach.\n\n### Final Enhanced Information:\nThe stomach secretes lipase, pepsinogens, and hydrochloric acid (HCl). Lipase, although secreted in smaller amounts compared to pancreatic lipase, plays a role in fat digestion. Pepsinogens are precursors to pepsin, crucial for protein digestion, and are activated by the acidic environment produced by HCl secretion. Therefore, all options listed (lipase, pepsinogens, HCl) are indeed secreted by the stomach, making the option \"None\" incorrect. The evidence paths support the secretion roles of these substances, aligning well with medical consensus.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"The stomach secretes lipase, pepsinogens, and hydrochloric acid (HCl).
