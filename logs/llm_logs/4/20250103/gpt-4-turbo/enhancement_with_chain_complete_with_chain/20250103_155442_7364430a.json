      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Biochemistry.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Essential amino acids are all except:\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Leucine\nopb. Lysine\nopc. Methionine\nopd. Proline\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Leucine\" -> \"classified as an essential amino acid\" -> \"necessary for human diet\" -> 0%\nCHAIN: \"Lysine\" -> \"classified as an essential amino acid\" -> \"necessary for human diet\" -> 0%\nCHAIN: \"Methionine\" -> \"classified as an essential amino acid\" -> \"necessary for human diet\" -> 0%\nCHAIN: \"Proline\" -> \"classified as a non-essential amino acid\" -> \"can be synthesized by the human body\" -> 100%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Leucine)-INTERACTS_WITH->(T-Lymphocyte)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Amino Acids)\n(Leucine)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cells)-LOCATION_OF->(Amino Acids)\n(Lysine)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cells)-INTERACTS_WITH/LOCATION_OF->(Amino Acids)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Among the options provided, Leucine, Lysine, and Methionine are classified as essential amino acids, which means they must be obtained through the diet as the human body cannot synthesize them. Proline, on the other hand, is a non-essential amino acid because it can be synthesized by the human body. Therefore, the correct answer to the question 'Essential amino acids are all except:' is Proline. The evidence paths provided, although broad, confirm the classification of Leucine and Lysine interacting within cells, aligning with their essential nature, but do not directly impact the differentiation between essential and non-essential amino acids.\"\n}",
