  "response": "### Enhanced Information Summary\n\nThe drug of choice for a pregnant female suspected of having a baby with congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) is dexamethasone. This decision is based on the specific need for a medication that effectively crosses the placenta to prevent virilization in a female fetus, a key concern in CAH. Dexamethasone is preferred because it crosses the placenta efficiently and does not activate the fetal adrenal glands, thereby preventing the excess androgen production that leads to virilization.\n\nThe reasoning chain for dexamethasone aligns well with medical consensus and is supported by the evidence path indicating that dexamethasone treats virilism, which is directly relevant to the prevention of virilization in CAH. Other corticosteroids like betamethasone, hydrocortisone, and prednisolone were considered; however, their effectiveness and appropriateness for this specific prenatal use are not supported as strongly as dexamethasone. Betamethasone does cross the placenta but is less commonly used for this indication. Hydrocortisone has poor placental crossing, making it less effective for fetal treatment in CAH. Prednisolone, while having moderate placental crossing, is not typically used for prenatal treatment of CAH and its effectiveness in this context remains unclear.\n\nThus, the best consensus-supported interpretation based on the available evidence and medical guidelines is that dexamethasone is the most appropriate choice for preventing virilization in fetuses at risk of CAH.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"The drug of choice for a pregnant female suspected of having a baby with congenital adrenal hyperplasia is dexamethasone.
