If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "### Enhanced Information Summary\n\nNimodipine is the drug specifically indicated for the prevention of cerebral vasospasm following a subarachnoid hemorrhage. This is supported by its mechanism of action as a calcium channel blocker with high specificity for cerebral arteries, which helps prevent the constriction of these vessels and reduces the risk of secondary ischemic injuries. Clinical guidelines and medical consensus strongly support the use of Nimodipine in this context due to its proven effectiveness in improving neurological outcomes.\n\nWhile other calcium channel blockers like Amlodipine, Diltiazem, and Verapamil are also used in various cardiovascular conditions, they do not have the same level of evidence or specific indications for cerebral vasospasm associated with subarachnoid hemorrhage. The evidence paths confirm that while Diltiazem and Verapamil are noted to treat cerebral vasospasm, they lack the targeted action and clinical endorsement that Nimodipine holds for this particular use. Amlodipine's role as a calcium channel blocker does not extend to a specific recommendation for cerebral vasospasm due to its broader vascular target profile and less specificity compared to Nimodipine.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate and consensus-aligned recommendation for a drug indicated in the case of subarachnoid hemorrhage, specifically to prevent cerebral vasospasm, is Nimodipine.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Nimodipine is the drug specifically indicated for the prevention of cerebral vasospasm following a subarachnoid hemorrhage, due to its high specificity for cerebral arteries and proven effectiveness in improving neurological outcomes.
