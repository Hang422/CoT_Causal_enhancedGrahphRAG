  "response": "### Enhanced Information Summary\n\nIsoniazid (INH), a medication used primarily for treating tuberculosis, is known to cause neuropathy as a side effect by interfering with the metabolism of pyridoxine (vitamin B6). This interference leads to a deficiency in pyridoxine, which is crucial for nerve function, resulting in peripheral neuropathy. The standard medical consensus and treatment for preventing or alleviating INH-induced neuropathy involve supplementing with pyridoxine.\n\nThe reasoning chains for pyridoxine (options b and c) correctly identify the depletion of pyridoxine due to INH use and the subsequent development of neuropathy. These chains are supported by evidence paths that directly link pyridoxine treatment to neuropathy alleviation, confirming that pyridoxine supplementation restores normal nerve function and reduces symptoms of neuropathy.\n\nIn contrast, the reasoning chains for thiamine, niacin, and riboflavin (options a, c, and d) suggest possible interactions or depletions but do not provide strong, direct evidence linking these vitamins to the specific treatment of INH-induced neuropathy. The evidence paths related to these vitamins are either too broad or not directly relevant to the specific mechanism by which INH causes neuropathy. Therefore, these options are not supported by either the medical consensus or the available evidence paths.\n\nIn conclusion, the best-supported treatment for INH-induced neuropathy, based on both the reasoning chains and the evidence paths, is the supplementation of pyridoxine. This approach is aligned with medical consensus and is directly supported by evidence linking pyridoxine supplementation to the alleviation of neuropathy symptoms caused by INH.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Isoniazid (INH) causes neuropathy by interfering with pyridoxine (vitamin B6) metabolism, leading to its deficiency and resulting in peripheral neuropathy.
