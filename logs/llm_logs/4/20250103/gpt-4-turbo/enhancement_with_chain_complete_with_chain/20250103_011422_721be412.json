      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Which of the following drug causes Pseudotumour cerebri -\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Sparfloxacin\nopb. Tetracycline\nopc. Gentamicin\nopd. Clofazimine\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Tetracycline\" -> \"inhibition of cerebrospinal fluid absorption\" -> \"increased intracranial pressure\" -> \"Pseudotumour cerebri\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Sparfloxacin\" -> \"no known effect on cerebrospinal fluid\" -> \"unlikely to cause Pseudotumour cerebri\" -> 10%\nCHAIN: \"Gentamicin\" -> \"primarily affects renal function and auditory nerves\" -> \"no significant impact on cerebrospinal fluid dynamics\" -> \"unlikely to cause Pseudotumour cerebri\" -> 10%\nCHAIN: \"Clofazimine\" -> \"used for leprosy and inflammatory conditions\" -> \"no reported cases linking to Pseudotumour cerebri\" -> \"unlikely to cause Pseudotumour cerebri\" -> 10%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Clofazimine)-TREATS->(Leprosy)\n(Leprosy)-CAUSES->(Disease)-CAUSES->(Pseudotumor Cerebri)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Among the listed drugs, Tetracycline is known to cause Pseudotumour cerebri. This is due to its effect on inhibiting the absorption of cerebrospinal fluid, which can lead to increased intracranial pressure, a characteristic of Pseudotumour cerebri. The other drugs listed, Sparfloxacin, Gentamicin, and Clofazimine, do not have known effects on cerebrospinal fluid dynamics or intracranial pressure that would lead to Pseudotumour cerebri. Specifically, Sparfloxacin has no known effect on cerebrospinal fluid, Gentamicin primarily affects renal function and auditory nerves without impacting cerebrospinal fluid dynamics, and Clofazimine, used for leprosy and inflammatory conditions, has no reported cases linking it to Pseudotumour cerebri. The evidence path linking Clofazimine to leprosy and then leprosy to Pseudotumor Cerebri is too broad and indirect to be relevant for this specific query.\"\n}",
