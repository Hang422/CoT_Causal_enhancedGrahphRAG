      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Pimozide belongs to class of:\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Thiothixanthene\nopb. Phenothiazine\nopc. Butyrophenone\nopd. Diphenyl butyl piperidine\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Pimozide\" -> \"antipsychotic medication\" -> \"belongs to diphenyl butyl piperidine class\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Pimozide\" -> \"used for Tourette's syndrome and schizophrenia\" -> \"not a phenothiazine\" -> \"not a thiothixanthene\" -> \"not a butyrophenone\" -> \"classified as diphenyl butyl piperidine\" -> 95%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Pimozide)-TREATS->(Gilles de la Tourette syndrome)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "### Enhanced Information Summary\n\nPimozide is a medication primarily used in the treatment of chronic psychiatric conditions such as Tourette's syndrome and schizophrenia. It is classified pharmacologically as a diphenyl butyl piperidine, distinguishing it from other classes of antipsychotics like phenothiazines, thiothixenes, and butyrophenones. This classification is based on its chemical structure and mechanism of action, which differs significantly from those of the other mentioned classes.\n\nThe reasoning chains provided correctly identify pimozide as belonging to the diphenyl butyl piperidine class. The evidence path mentioning pimozide's use in treating Gilles de la Tourette syndrome supports its clinical application but does not directly influence its classification among antipsychotic drugs. Therefore, while the evidence path confirms the drug's use, it does not alter the classification based on chemical structure and pharmacological action.\n\nIn conclusion, pimozide is accurately classified as a diphenyl butyl piperidine based on its unique chemical structure and mechanism, distinct from other antipsychotic classes such as phenothiazines, thiothixenes, and butyrophenones.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Pimozide is a diphenyl butyl piperidine, used primarily for treating Tourette's syndrome and schizophrenia.
