Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Characteristics of glycoprotein:\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Protein linked with glycosidic bond\nopb. Core protein\nopc. Sugar residues are long in carbohydrate poion of glycoprotein\nopd. None\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Protein linked with glycosidic bond\" -> \"describes a glycosidic bond linking a protein to a carbohydrate in glycoproteins\" -> \"accurate characteristic of glycoproteins\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Core protein\" -> \"refers to the protein part of a glycoprotein\" -> \"essential component of glycoproteins\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: s\" -> \"long sugar residues can occur but not a defining characteristic\" -> 70%\nCHAIN: \"None\" -> \"implies no options are correct\" -> \"incorrect as other options are valid characteristics of glycoproteins\" -> 10%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Proteins)-INTERACTS_WITH/PART_OF->(Cells)-LOCATION_OF->(Glycoproteins)\n(Proteins)-INTERACTS_WITH->(T-Lymphocyte)-LOCATION_OF->(Carbohydrates)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "### Enhanced Information Analysis:\n\n#### Option A: Protein linked with glycosidic bond\n- **Original Chain Analysis**: The chain correctly identifies that glycoproteins involve a glycosidic bond linking a protein to a carbohydrate. This is a fundamental aspect of glycoproteins where carbohydrates (often oligosaccharides) are covalently attached to the polypeptide side chains.\n- **Evidence Path Relevance**: The evidence paths provided do not directly support the specific nature of the bond in glycoproteins but establish the interaction between proteins and carbohydrates within biological contexts.\n- **Consensus Confirmation**: The description aligns with biochemical consensus that glycoproteins are characterized by glycosidic bonds between carbohydrates and the amino acid side chains of proteins.\n\n#### Option B: Core protein\n- **Original Chain Analysis**: This chain correctly points out that the core protein is an essential component of a glycoprotein, forming the backbone to which carbohydrates are attached.\n- **Evidence Path Relevance**: The paths mention interactions between proteins and other cellular components but do not specifically address the core protein concept in glycoproteins.\n- **Consensus Confirmation**: It is a standard understanding in biochemistry that glycoproteins consist of a core protein structure.\n\n#### Option C: Sugar residues are long in carbohydrate portion of glycoprotein\n- **Original Chain Analysis**: The chain suggests that while long sugar residues can occur in glycoproteins, they are not a defining or consistent characteristic across all glycoproteins.\n- **Evidence Path Relevance**: No specific evidence paths address the length of sugar residues in glycoproteins.\n- **Consensus Confirmation**: Biochemical consensus agrees that the length and composition of sugar chains in glycoproteins can vary widely; thus, length is not a definitive characteristic.\n\n#### Option D: None\n- **Original Chain Analysis**: This option is correctly identified as incorrect since other options validly describe characteristics of glycoproteins.\n- **Evidence Path Relevance**: Not applicable as the option is inherently incorrect.\n- **Consensus Confirmation**: Biochemical knowledge confirms that the characteristics listed in other options are indeed true of glycoproteins, invalidating this option.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe characteristics of glycoproteins include having a core protein structure and being linked by glycosidic bonds to carbohydrates. The length of sugar residues, while variable, is not a defining feature. The evidence paths, while broad, support the interaction of proteins and carbohydrates but do not specifically enhance the understanding of glycoprotein structure beyond what is established by biochemical consensus.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Glycoproteins are characterized by a core protein structure and the presence of glycosidic bonds linking carbohydrates to the protein's amino acid side chains. The length of sugar residues in glycoproteins can vary and is not a defining characteristic. Biochemical consensus supports these characteristics, and while the provided evidence paths confirm general protein-carbohydrate interactions, they do not specifically address these points in detail.\"\n}\n```",
