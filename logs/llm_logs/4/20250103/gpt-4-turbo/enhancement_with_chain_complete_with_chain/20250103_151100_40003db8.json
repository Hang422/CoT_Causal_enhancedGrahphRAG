      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Anticoagulant of choice for prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism in patient with cancer surgery is:-\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Heparin sulfate\nopb. Protamine sulfate\nopc. Low molecular weight heparin\nopd. Warfarin\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Cancer surgery\" -> \"increased risk of venous thromboembolism\" -> \"need for effective anticoagulant\" -> \"Low molecular weight heparin\" -> \"proven efficacy in cancer patients\" -> \"recommended by guidelines\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Cancer surgery\" -> \"increased risk of venous thromboembolism\" -> \"need for anticoagulation\" -> \"Heparin sulfate\" -> \"less effective in cancer patients compared to LMWH\" -> \"not the first choice\" -> 70%\nCHAIN: \"Cancer surgery\" -> \"increased risk of venous thromboembolism\" -> \"need for anticoagulation\" -> \"Warfarin\" -> \"requires monitoring and slow onset\" -> \"not ideal for immediate postoperative period\" -> 65%\nCHAIN: \"Cancer surgery\" -> \"increased risk of venous thromboembolism\" -> \"need for anticoagulation\" -> \"Protamine sulfate\" -> \"used to reverse effects of heparin, not as a prophylactic\" -> \"incorrect use\" -> 10%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Protamine Sulfate)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cells)-INTERACTS_WITH/LOCATION_OF->(Heparin)\n(Venous Thromboembolism)-CAUSES->(Death, Sudden)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Genes)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Anticoagulants)\n(anticoagulation)-CAUSES/PREVENTS->(Disease)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Antiinflammatory Effect)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Protamine Sulfate)\n(anticoagulation)-CAUSES/PREVENTS->(Thrombosis)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Warfarin)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"For the prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism in patients undergoing cancer surgery, Low Molecular Weight Heparin (LMWH) is the anticoagulant of choice. This decision is supported by clinical guidelines and evidence demonstrating its efficacy and safety profile in cancer patients. LMWH is preferred over unfractionated heparin (heparin sulfate) due to its more predictable anticoagulant effect and lower risk of bleeding. Warfarin, while effective for long-term anticoagulation, is not ideal for immediate postoperative prophylaxis due to its need for careful monitoring and dose adjustment. Protamine sulfate is not used as a prophylactic agent but rather as a reversal agent for heparin, confirming its inappropriateness for this indication. The evidence path highlighting the interaction between anticoagulants and thrombosis supports the use of anticoagulants like LMWH to prevent thrombosis in high-risk scenarios such as post-cancer surgery.\"\n}",
