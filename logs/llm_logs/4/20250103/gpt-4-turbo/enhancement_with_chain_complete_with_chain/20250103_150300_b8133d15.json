Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4.

Large T tubules\nopc. Troponin system present\nopd.

Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3.

  "response": "### Enhanced Information Summary\n\nCardiac muscle is characterized by several distinct features that differentiate it from other muscle types. Here's a breakdown of the options provided, aligned with medical consensus and supported by relevant evidence:\n\n1. **Striated**: Cardiac muscle is indeed striated, similar to skeletal muscle, due to the organized arrangement of actin and myosin filaments. This feature is well-established in medical literature and matches option A.\n\n2. **Large T tubules**: The assertion in option B that cardiac muscle has large T tubules is incorrect. In fact, T tubules in cardiac muscle are smaller and less extensive compared to those in skeletal muscle. This is a critical point of differentiation and directly conflicts with option B.\n\n3. **Troponin system present**: Cardiac muscle uses the troponin system for calcium-mediated regulation of contraction, aligning with option C. This is a fundamental mechanism in cardiac muscle contraction and is well-documented in biochemistry.\n\n4. **Caldesmon as an important regulatory protein**: Caldesmon is not a significant regulatory protein in cardiac muscle; it is more relevant in smooth muscle. The evidence paths confirm that caldesmon interacts with cells in smooth muscle tissue, supporting the assertion that its primary role is outside of cardiac muscle function. This directly conflicts with option D.\n\nIn conclusion, all options except for option D accurately describe features of cardiac muscle. Caldesmon's role as an important regulatory protein in cardiac muscle is not supported by medical consensus or the provided evidence paths, making option D the correct answer to the question of which feature is not associated with cardiac muscle.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Cardiac muscle is striated and uses the troponin system for contraction, but has smaller T tubules compared to skeletal muscle. Caldesmon, primarily associated with smooth muscle, is not a significant regulatory protein in cardiac muscle, making option D ('Caldesmon is an important regulatory protein') the correct answer as it does not describe a feature of cardiac muscle.\"\n}\n```",
