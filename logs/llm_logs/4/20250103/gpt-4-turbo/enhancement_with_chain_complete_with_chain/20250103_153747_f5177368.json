      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Biochemistry.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4.

Retinol\nopb. Retinal\nopc. Retinoic acids\nopd. All of the above\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Vitamin A\" -> \"converted to retinol in the body\" -> \"retinol supports vision and skin health\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Vitamin A\" -> \"metabolized to retinal\" -> \"retinal essential for vision\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Vitamin A\" -> \"converted to retinoic acids\" -> \"retinoic acids regulate gene expression and cell differentiation\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Vitamin A\" -> \"includes retinol, retinal, and retinoic acids\" -> \"all forms are crucial for different physiological functions\" -> \"all of the above are correct\" -> 98%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Vitamin A)-CAUSES->(Disease)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(paracrine)-PROCESS_OF->(Retina)\n(Vitamin A)-CAUSES->(Disease)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(uptake)-PROCESS_OF->(Retina)\n(Vitamin A)-CAUSES->(Disease)-CAUSES->(arterial stiffness)-PROCESS_OF->(Retina)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3.

  "response": "### Enhanced Information Summary\n\nVitamin A is a crucial nutrient that is metabolized into several biologically active forms within the body, each serving distinct physiological functions. These forms include retinol, retinal, and retinoic acids. \n\n1. **Retinol** is a primary form of vitamin A that supports vision and skin health. It is stored in the liver and transported to peripheral tissues where it is needed.\n2. **Retinal** is essential for vision, particularly in the conversion of light into electrical signals in the retina of the eye. This process is critical for night vision.\n3. **Retinoic acids** are known for their role in gene expression and cell differentiation, impacting a wide range of biological processes including immune function and embryonic development.\n\nThe reasoning chains provided for each option align well with the standard medical consensus on the functions of vitamin A and its metabolites. The evidence paths, while broad, hint at the importance of vitamin A in various biological processes, particularly in vision as indicated by the repeated reference to the retina. However, these paths do not directly enhance the understanding of the specific roles of retinol, retinal, and retinoic acids.\n\nGiven the comprehensive roles of all these metabolites, the correct answer to the question regarding the function of vitamin A is \"All of the above,\" as each metabolite (retinol, retinal, retinoic acids) plays a crucial role in human physiology. This conclusion is supported by the reasoning chains and aligns with the biochemical functions of vitamin A derivatives.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Vitamin A is metabolized into retinol, retinal, and retinoic acids, each serving essential physiological functions. Retinol supports vision and skin health, retinal is crucial for vision, particularly night vision, and retinoic acids regulate gene expression and cell differentiation. The correct answer to the function of vitamin A is 'All of the above,' reflecting the diverse and critical roles of its metabolites in human health.\"\n}\n```",
