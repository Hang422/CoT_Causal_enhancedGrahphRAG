Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4.

Immunostimulant\nopc. Paralysis of worms by depolarisation\nopd. Immunodepressant in high doses\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Levamisole\" -> \"used as an anthelmintic\" -> \"effective in single doses for ascariasis\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Levamisole\" -> \"acts as an immunomodulator\" -> \"functions as an immunostimulant\" -> 98%\nCHAIN: \"Levamisole\" -> \"causes hyperpolarization of worm muscle membrane\" -> \"leads to paralysis of worms\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Levamisole\" -> \"used in low doses primarily\" -> \"immunodepressant effects at high doses unclear\" -> 70%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Levamisole)-TREATS->(Disease)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Immunity)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Immunologic Adjuvants)\n(Levamisole)-TREATS->(Disease)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Antiinflammatory Effect)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Immunologic Adjuvants)\n(Anthelmintics)-PREVENTS->(Ascariasis)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3.

  "response": "### Enhanced Information Summary:\n\nLevamisole is primarily known for its use as an anthelmintic agent, particularly effective in treating ascariasis, often in single doses. This aligns with the consensus that anthelmintics, including Levamisole, are effective in preventing and treating ascariasis, as supported by the evidence path linking anthelmintics to the prevention of ascariasis.\n\nAdditionally, Levamisole acts as an immunomodulator. It is generally recognized for its immunostimulant properties, which is consistent with the retrieved evidence paths that associate Levamisole with immunologic adjuvants, indicating its role in enhancing immune responses.\n\nRegarding the paralysis of worms, Levamisole achieves this through depolarization (not hyperpolarization as initially stated) of the worm muscle membrane, leading to muscle contraction and subsequent paralysis. This mechanism is a well-established action of Levamisole in its anthelmintic capacity.\n\nThe claim of Levamisole acting as an immunodepressant at high doses is not well-supported by robust evidence or medical consensus. The evidence paths and standard medical understanding suggest that while Levamisole has immunomodulatory effects, its role as an immunodepressant, especially at high doses, remains unclear and not well-documented.\n\nBased on the corrected reasoning and the integration of relevant evidence paths, the best answer to the question \"Levamisole is used as all except\" is option (opd) \"Immunodepressant in high doses,\" as this use is not well-supported by medical consensus or evidence.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Levamisole is effectively used as an anthelmintic for ascariasis, often in single doses, and acts as an immunostimulant by enhancing immune responses. It paralyzes worms through depolarization of muscle membranes. However, its use as an immunodepressant at high doses is not supported by strong evidence or consensus, making it the correct answer to the query about its non-uses.\"\n}\n```",
