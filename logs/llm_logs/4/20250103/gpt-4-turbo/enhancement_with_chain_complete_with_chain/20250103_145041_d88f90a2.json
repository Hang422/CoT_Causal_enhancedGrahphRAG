Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4.

Alpha IEN\nopb. Beta IFN\nopc. Gamma IFN\nopd. Natalizumab\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Beta IFN\" -> \"modulates immune response\" -> \"reduces frequency of relapses in RRMS\" -> \"approved as first-line treatment for RRMS\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Natalizumab\" -> \"blocks immune cell migration to CNS\" -> \"reduces inflammation and relapse rates in RRMS\" -> \"used for patients with inadequate response to first-line treatments\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Alpha IEN\" -> \"antiviral and antiproliferative properties\" -> \"not primarily used for RRMS\" -> \"less effective in reducing relapse rates compared to Beta IFN\" -> 40%\nCHAIN: \"Gamma IFN\" -> \"increases immune response\" -> \"potentially exacerbates autoimmune diseases\" -> \"not recommended for RRMS treatment\" -> 30%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(natalizumab)-TREATS->(Disease)-CAUSES->(Obstruction)\n(natalizumab)-TREATS->(Epilepsy)-CAUSES->(Obstruction)\n(Recombinant Interleukin-6)-CAUSES->(Hyperesthesia)-PREDISPOSES->(Disease)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Immunity)\n(Recombinant Interleukin-6)-TREATS->(Liver Failure)-CAUSES->(Disease)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Immunity)\n(Recombinant Interleukin-6)-TREATS->(Baculovirus)-CAUSES->(Disease)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Immunity)\n(natalizumab)-TREATS->(Complication)-CAUSES->(Obstruction)\n(Relapse)-CAUSES->(Adhesions)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Genes)-PART_OF->(Mucous Membrane)-LOCATION_OF->(First line treatment)\n(Relapse)-CAUSES->(Adhesions)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Genes)-PART_OF->(Skeletal muscle structure)-LOCATION_OF->(First line treatment)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2.

  "response": "### Enhanced Information Summary\n\n**Beta IFN (Interferon beta)** is widely recognized as a first-line treatment for relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). It modulates the immune response, which is crucial in a disease characterized by an abnormal immune attack on the central nervous system. Clinical evidence supports that Beta IFN reduces the frequency of relapses in RRMS patients, aligning with its approval status for this indication.\n\n**Natalizumab** is another effective medication for RRMS but is generally reserved for patients who have not responded adequately to first-line treatments like Beta IFN. It works by blocking the migration of immune cells into the CNS, thereby reducing inflammation and the rate of relapses. This makes it a valuable option for more aggressive or treatment-resistant cases of RRMS.\n\n**Alpha IFN (Interferon alpha)** and **Gamma IFN (Interferon gamma)** are not typically used for RRMS. Alpha IFN has antiviral and antiproliferative properties but does not directly address the immune dysregulation seen in RRMS. Gamma IFN, on the other hand, can potentially exacerbate autoimmune conditions, including RRMS, due to its immune-enhancing effects.\n\nThe retrieved evidence paths do not provide additional relevant information directly applicable to the treatment of RRMS with these drugs. The paths mentioning natalizumab and various diseases and complications are too broad and do not specifically address its role in RRMS beyond what is already established in medical consensus.\n\nIn conclusion, based on standard medical consensus and the specific characteristics of these treatments, **Beta IFN remains the drug of choice for most patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis**, with natalizumab as a secondary option for those with inadequate response to first-line therapies.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Beta IFN is the first-line treatment for relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis, effectively reducing relapse frequency by modulating the immune response. Natalizumab serves as a secondary option, particularly for patients who do not respond adequately to first-line treatments, by blocking immune cell migration to the CNS and reducing inflammation. Alpha IFN and Gamma IFN are not suitable for RRMS, with Gamma IFN potentially worsening the condition.\"\n}\n```",
