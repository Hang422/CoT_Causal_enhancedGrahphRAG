      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Physiology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        The only Sugar normaly absorbed in the intestine against a concentration gradient is :\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Xylose\nopb. Mannose\nopc. Glucose\nopd. Ribose\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Glucose\" -> \"absorbed via active transport in the intestine\" -> \"requires energy to move against concentration gradient\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Xylose\" -> \"absorbed via passive diffusion\" -> \"does not require energy, not against gradient\" -> 10%\nCHAIN: \"Mannose\" -> \"absorbed but mechanism similar to glucose\" -> \"unclear if against concentration gradient like glucose\" -> 50%\nCHAIN: \"Ribose\" -> \"absorbed via facilitated diffusion\" -> \"does not move against concentration gradient\" -> 10%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Glucose)-CAUSES->(Intestinal Metabolism)-PROCESS_OF->(Intestines)\n(Glucose)-CAUSES->(paracrine)-PROCESS_OF->(Intestines)\n(Glucose)-CAUSES->(Respiration)-PROCESS_OF->(Intestines)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Glucose is the only sugar normally absorbed in the intestine against a concentration gradient. This absorption process is mediated by active transport mechanisms, specifically involving sodium-glucose transport proteins (SGLT1), which require energy in the form of ATP. This is consistent with the physiological consensus that active transport is necessary for moving substances against their concentration gradient. The evidence paths mentioning glucose's role in intestinal metabolism and its energy requirements during respiration support this understanding, as active transport is an energy-dependent process. Other sugars like xylose, mannose, and ribose are absorbed via passive or facilitated diffusion, which do not work against a concentration gradient and thus do not require energy input.\"\n}",
