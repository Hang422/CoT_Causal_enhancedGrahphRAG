      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        All of the following drugs are indicated in the treatment of bipolar disorder except?\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Carbamazepine\nopb. Vigabatrin\nopc. Sodium valproate\nopd. Lamotrigine\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Carbamazepine\" -> \"used as a mood stabilizer\" -> \"indicated for bipolar disorder\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Vigabatrin\" -> \"used primarily for epilepsy\" -> \"not typically indicated for bipolar disorder\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Sodium valproate\" -> \"acts as a mood stabilizer\" -> \"indicated for bipolar disorder\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Lamotrigine\" -> \"used as a mood stabilizer\" -> \"indicated for bipolar disorder\" -> 95%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Vigabatrin)-COMPLICATES->(Epilepsy)\n(Carbamazepine)-INTERACTS_WITH/ISA->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Mood Stabilizer)\n(Sodium Valproate)-INTERACTS_WITH/ISA->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Mood Stabilizer)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Carbamazepine, sodium valproate, and lamotrigine are all used as mood stabilizers and are indicated for the treatment of bipolar disorder, aligning with medical consensus and supported by their interactions as pharmaceutical preparations with mood stabilizing properties. Vigabatrin, however, is primarily used for epilepsy and is not typically indicated for bipolar disorder, which is consistent with its primary complication with epilepsy and lack of association with mood stabilization.\"\n}",
