      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Biochemistry.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        While going for oxidation in the mitochondria, free fatty acid are transpoed by:\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. None of the above\nopb. Albumin\nopc. Globulins\nopd. Chylomicrons\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Free fatty acids\" -> \"released into the bloodstream\" -> \"bound by albumin for transport\" -> \"transported to mitochondria for oxidation\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Free fatty acids\" -> \"need transport molecules in blood\" -> \"albumin acts as a carrier for fatty acids\" -> \"fatty acids reach mitochondria\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Chylomicrons\" -> \"transport dietary lipids from intestines\" -> \"not primarily for transporting free fatty acids to mitochondria\" -> \"less likely to be involved in this context\" -> 70%\nCHAIN: \"Globulins\" -> \"function mainly in immune response\" -> \"not involved in fatty acid transport\" -> \"unlikely to transport free fatty acids to mitochondria\" -> 60%\nCHAIN: \"None of the above\" -> \"implies no correct carrier listed\" -> \"incorrect because albumin is a known carrier\" -> \"not applicable in this scenario\" -> 10%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Albumins)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cells)-INTERACTS_WITH/LOCATION_OF->(E2F1 gene|E2F1|UBE2L3)-PART_OF->(Mitochondria)\n(Chylomicrons)-CAUSES->(uptake)-PROCESS_OF->(Intestines)\n(Blood Circulation)-PROCESS_OF->(Organ)-LOCATION_OF->(Albumins)\n(Blood Circulation)-PROCESS_OF->(Entire tibia)-LOCATION_OF->(Albumins)\n(Release procedure)-PREVENTS->(Complication)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Albumins)\n(Release procedure)-TREATS->(Functional disorder)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Albumins)\n(Fatty Acids)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Genes)-PART_OF->(Mitochondria)\n(Fatty Acids)-PART_OF->(Liposomes)-PART_OF->(Mitochondria)\n(Intestines)-LOCATION_OF->(Palmitates)-PART_OF->(Mitochondria)\n(Globulins)-CAUSES->(Asthenia)-CAUSES->(Disease)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(physiological aspects)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "### Enhanced Information Summary\n\nFree fatty acids (FFAs) are primarily transported in the bloodstream bound to albumin. Albumin acts as a carrier for these fatty acids, facilitating their transport to various tissues, including the mitochondria for oxidation. This is a well-established biochemical consensus, supported by the evidence path linking albumin with cellular interactions and mitochondrial components. The role of albumin in FFA transport is crucial because FFAs are hydrophobic and cannot circulate freely in the aqueous environment of the blood.\n\nChylomicrons, on the other hand, are primarily involved in the transport of dietary lipids from the intestines to other parts of the body and are not predominantly used for transporting FFAs to the mitochondria for oxidation. This aligns with the evidence path indicating that chylomicrons are associated with lipid uptake processes in the intestines.\n\nGlobulins are mainly involved in immune responses and other functions but do not play a significant role in the transport of FFAs to the mitochondria. The evidence paths do not suggest any direct involvement of globulins in fatty acid transport or mitochondrial interactions.\n\nThe option \"None of the above\" is incorrect as albumin is indeed a known and significant carrier for FFAs in the bloodstream, facilitating their transport to the mitochondria.\n\nIn conclusion, albumin is the correct answer for the transport of free fatty acids to the mitochondria for oxidation, supported by both biochemical consensus and relevant evidence paths.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Free fatty acids are primarily transported in the bloodstream bound to albumin, which facilitates their transport to various tissues, including the mitochondria for oxidation.
