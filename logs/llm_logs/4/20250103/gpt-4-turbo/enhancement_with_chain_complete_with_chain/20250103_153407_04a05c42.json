      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Drug of choice for Treponema Pallidum is?\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Penicillin G\nopb. Tetracycline\nopc. Azithromycin\nopd. Doxycycline\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Treponema pallidum\" -> \"causative agent of syphilis\" -> \"Penicillin G recommended by CDC\" -> \"effective at all stages of syphilis\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Treponema pallidum\" -> \"sensitive to penicillin\" -> \"Penicillin G disrupts bacterial cell wall synthesis\" -> \"bactericidal effect\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Treponema pallidum\" -> \"alternative treatment needed for penicillin allergy\" -> \"Doxycycline used as alternative\" -> \"less effective than Penicillin G\" -> 80%\nCHAIN: \"Treponema pallidum\" -> \"requires antibiotic treatment\" -> \"Azithromycin used in some cases\" -> \"potential for resistance\" -> 70%\nCHAIN: \"Treponema pallidum\" -> \"treated with antibiotics\" -> \"Tetracycline is a possible alternative\" -> \"less preferred due to side effects and resistance issues\" -> 75%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Treponema pallidum)-CAUSES->(Syphilis)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Penicillin G is the drug of choice for treating Treponema pallidum, the causative agent of syphilis, as recommended by the CDC. It is effective at all stages of the disease due to its bactericidal effect, which involves disrupting the bacterial cell wall synthesis. For individuals allergic to penicillin, Doxycycline serves as an alternative treatment, though it is less effective than Penicillin G. Other antibiotics like Azithromycin and Tetracycline are also used in some cases but are generally less preferred due to potential resistance and side effects. The evidence path confirming Treponema pallidum as the cause of syphilis supports the use of these antibiotics, particularly emphasizing the primary role of Penicillin G in treatment.\"\n}",
