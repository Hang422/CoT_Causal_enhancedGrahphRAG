  "response": "### Enhanced Information Summary\n\n1. **Increases liver glycogenolysis**: Epinephrine, when administered in high doses, activates beta-adrenergic receptors, specifically the beta-2 subtype in liver cells. This activation leads to an increase in cyclic AMP, which in turn activates glycogen phosphorylase, an enzyme responsible for breaking down glycogen into glucose. This process is known as glycogenolysis. The evidence path confirming the interaction of cyclic AMP with liver enzymes supports this chain of reasoning.\n\n2. **Causes bronchiolar constriction**: This option is incorrect as epinephrine, particularly at high doses, primarily activates beta-2 adrenergic receptors which cause bronchiolar relaxation, not constriction. This is a well-established physiological response where the activation of these receptors leads to the relaxation of smooth muscle in the bronchioles, facilitating easier breathing. The reasoning chain and evidence paths related to beta-2 adrenergic receptors support this opposite effect (relaxation), confirming that bronchiolar constriction is not an action of epinephrine.\n\n3. **Evokes extrasystoles in the heart**: High doses of epinephrine stimulate beta-1 adrenergic receptors in the heart, which can increase the heart rate and the force of contraction. This heightened cardiac activity can lead to extrasystoles, which are premature heartbeats. The evidence paths linking increased force of contraction to premature cardiac complexes align with this reasoning, supporting the idea that epinephrine can evoke extrasystoles.\n\n4. **Produces restlessness and anxiety**: Epinephrine can stimulate the central nervous system, leading to increased alertness and anxiety. This stimulation can manifest as psychological effects such as restlessness and anxiety. The evidence paths linking anxiety to agitation provide additional support for this chain, confirming that high doses of epinephrine can indeed produce these psychological effects.\n\nIn conclusion, the action that is not associated with high doses of epinephrine is bronchiolar constriction. Instead, epinephrine causes bronchiolar relaxation. The other actions listed (increases liver glycogenolysis, evokes extrasystoles in the heart, and produces restlessness and anxiety) are all consistent with the pharmacological effects of epinephrine.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Epinephrine, when administered intravenously in high doses, increases liver glycogenolysis, evokes extrasystoles in the heart, and produces restlessness and anxiety. However, it does not cause bronchiolar constriction; it causes bronchiolar relaxation. This is supported by the activation of beta-2 adrenergic receptors leading to relaxation of bronchiolar smooth muscle, contrary to the incorrect option suggesting constriction.\"\n}\n```",
