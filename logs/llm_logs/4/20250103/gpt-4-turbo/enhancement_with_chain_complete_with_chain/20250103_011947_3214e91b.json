      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Which of the following most often causes cholestatic jaundice:\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. INH\nopb. Erythromycin estolate\nopc. Pyrazinamide\nopd. Ethionamide\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Erythromycin estolate\" -> \"inhibits bile flow\" -> \"accumulation of bile in the liver\" -> \"cholestatic jaundice\" -> 75%\nCHAIN: \"INH\" -> \"mild liver enzyme elevation\" -> \"rarely leads to cholestasis\" -> \"unlikely cause of cholestatic jaundice\" -> 30%\nCHAIN: \"Pyrazinamide\" -> \"can cause liver injury\" -> \"more often hepatocellular than cholestatic\" -> \"less likely cause of cholestatic jaundice\" -> 40%\nCHAIN: \"Ethionamide\" -> \"hepatotoxic effects\" -> \"primarily hepatocellular damage\" -> \"infrequent cause of cholestatic jaundice\" -> 35%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(isoniazid)-PREVENTS/TREATS->(Complication)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Liver enzyme)\n(Liver enzyme)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Hepatocyte)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-PREDISPOSES/PREVENTS->(Cholestasis)\n(Cholestasis)-CAUSES->(Jaundice, Obstructive)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Among the options provided, Erythromycin estolate is the most common cause of cholestatic jaundice. This is because Erythromycin estolate is known to inhibit bile flow, leading to the accumulation of bile in the liver and subsequently causing cholestatic jaundice. The other drugs listed, such as INH (Isoniazid), Pyrazinamide, and Ethionamide, are more commonly associated with hepatocellular damage rather than cholestasis. INH, for instance, typically causes mild liver enzyme elevation and rarely leads to cholestasis. Similarly, Pyrazinamide and Ethionamide primarily cause hepatocellular damage, making them less likely to cause cholestatic jaundice. The evidence paths confirm the association between liver enzyme disruptions and liver damage but do not specifically support the frequency of cholestasis with these drugs compared to Erythromycin estolate.\"\n}",
