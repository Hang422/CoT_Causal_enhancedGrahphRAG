      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Biochemistry.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        True statement regarding insulin:\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Produced by alpha cells of pancreas\nopb. Two polypeptide chains are bound by disulfide linkages\nopc. Shifts potassium outside the cell\nopd. S.c insulin tl/2 is 60 mins\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Insulin\" -> \"produced by beta cells of pancreas\" -> \"not produced by alpha cells\" -> 5%\nCHAIN: s connected by disulfide bonds\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Insulin function\" -> \"increases cellular uptake of potassium\" -> \"shifts potassium into the cell\" -> 5%\nCHAIN: \"Insulin administration\" -> \"subcutaneous injection\" -> \"half-life approximately 5-6 minutes\" -> \"not 60 minutes\" -> 5%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Insulin)-CAUSES->(Energy Metabolism)-PROCESS_OF->(Pancreas)\n(Insulin)-CAUSES->(physiological aspects)-PROCESS_OF->(Pancreas)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "### Enhanced Information Summary\n\n1. **Option A: Produced by alpha cells of pancreas**\n   - **Consensus Fact**: Insulin is produced by the beta cells of the pancreas, not the alpha cells. Alpha cells primarily produce glucagon.\n   - **Corrected Chain**: Insulin is produced by beta cells in the pancreas. This directly contradicts the statement in option A, making it false.\n\n2. **Option B: Two polypeptide chains are bound by disulfide linkages**\n   - **Consensus Fact**: Insulin is indeed composed of two polypeptide chains (A and B chains) that are connected by disulfide bonds.\n   - **Supported Chain**: This option is accurate and aligns with biochemical consensus about the structure of insulin.\n\n3. **Option C: Shifts potassium outside the cell**\n   - **Consensus Fact**: Insulin promotes the uptake of potassium into the cells, not shifting it outside. It facilitates the movement of potassium from the bloodstream into the cells, which is critical for cellular function.\n   - **Corrected Chain**: Insulin increases the cellular uptake of potassium, thereby shifting potassium into the cell, not outside. This makes option C false.\n\n4. **Option D: S.c insulin t1/2 is 60 mins**\n   - **Consensus Fact**: The half-life of subcutaneously administered insulin is typically around 5-6 minutes, not 60 minutes. The duration of action can vary depending on the type of insulin formulation, but the half-life remains much shorter than 60 minutes.\n   - **Corrected Chain**: The half-life of subcutaneously injected insulin is approximately 5-6 minutes. This makes option D false.\n\n**Relevant Evidence Paths**: The provided paths about insulin's role in energy metabolism and physiological aspects are too broad and do not directly support or refute any specific option regarding the biochemical properties or pharmacokinetics of insulin.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe only true statement among the options, based on medical and biochemical consensus, is option B: \"Two polypeptide chains are bound by disulfide linkages.\" The other options are contradicted by well-established facts about insulin's production, function, and pharmacokinetics.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"The only true statement regarding insulin among the options is that it consists of two polypeptide chains bound by disulfide linkages. Insulin is produced by beta cells of the pancreas, not alpha cells, and it facilitates the uptake of potassium into cells, contrary to shifting it outside. The half-life of subcutaneously administered insulin is approximately 5-6 minutes, not 60 minutes.\"\n}\n```",
