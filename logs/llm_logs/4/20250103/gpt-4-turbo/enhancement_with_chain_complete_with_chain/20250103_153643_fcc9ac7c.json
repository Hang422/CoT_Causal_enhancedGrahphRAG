      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Biochemistry.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Which of the following is the source of energy for a cardiac muscle at normal conditions?\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Fatty acids\nopb. Ketone bodies\nopc. Glucose\nopd. Any of the above\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Fatty acids\" -> \"primary energy source for cardiac muscle under normal conditions\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Ketone bodies\" -> \"used by cardiac muscle during fasting or low carbohydrate intake, not normal conditions\" -> \"less likely primary source under normal conditions\" -> 30%\nCHAIN: \"Glucose\" -> \"utilized by cardiac muscle\" -> \"not the primary source under normal conditions compared to fatty acids\" -> 70%\nCHAIN: \"Any of the above\" -> \"cardiac muscle can metabolize all these substrates\" -> \"fatty acids remain the predominant source under normal conditions\" -> 80%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Glucose)-CAUSES->(Energy Metabolism)-PROCESS_OF->(Myocardium)\n(Myocardium)-LOCATION_OF->(Fatty Acids)\n(Fatty Acids)-TREATS->(Obesity)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Energy Metabolism)-PROCESS_OF->(Myocardium)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Under normal conditions, the primary source of energy for cardiac muscle is fatty acids. This is supported by the evidence path linking myocardium location to fatty acid metabolism. While cardiac muscle can also utilize glucose and ketone bodies, these are not the predominant sources under normal conditions. Glucose is indeed metabolized by the heart, but it is secondary to fatty acids. Ketone bodies are typically used under conditions of fasting or low carbohydrate intake, making them a less likely primary source in normal conditions. Therefore, the most accurate answer is that fatty acids are the main energy source for cardiac muscle under typical conditions.\"\n}",
