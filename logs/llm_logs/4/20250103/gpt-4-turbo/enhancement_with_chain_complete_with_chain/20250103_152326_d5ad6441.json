      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Drug of choice for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder is:-\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Haloperidol\nopb. Imipramine\nopc. Alprazolam\nopd. Methylphenidate\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Methylphenidate\" -> \"stimulates central nervous system\" -> \"increases dopamine and norepinephrine in the brain\" -> \"improves attention and focus in ADHD patients\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Haloperidol\" -> \"antipsychotic medication\" -> \"used primarily for schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders\" -> \"not typically used for ADHD\" -> \"possible misuse could worsen symptoms of ADHD\" -> 10%\nCHAIN: \"Imipramine\" -> \"tricyclic antidepressant\" -> \"sometimes used off-label for ADHD\" -> \"less effective than stimulants for ADHD\" -> \"potential side effects\" -> 40%\nCHAIN: \"Alprazolam\" -> \"benzodiazepine\" -> \"used for anxiety disorders\" -> \"not indicated for ADHD\" -> \"could potentially reduce hyperactivity but not improve attention or cognitive functions\" -> 15%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Norepinephrine)-TREATS->(Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder)\n(Dopamine)-PREVENTS->(Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder)\n(Benzodiazepines)-TREATS->(Anxiety Disorders)\n(Haloperidol)-INTERACTS_WITH/ISA->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Antipsychotic Agents)\n(Alprazolam)-TREATS->(Disease)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Virus)-LOCATION_OF->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Benzodiazepines)\n(Alprazolam)-TREATS->(Chronic Disease)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Virus)-LOCATION_OF->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Benzodiazepines)\n(Antidepressive Agents, Tricyclic)-TREATS->(Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder)\n(Imipramine)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Antidepressive Agents)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Antidepressive Agents, Tricyclic)\n(Imipramine)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Antipsychotic Agents)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Antidepressive Agents, Tricyclic)\n(Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder)-CAUSES/COMPLICATES->(Disease)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(biological adaptation to stress)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Central Nervous System Stimulants)\n(Antipsychotic Agents)-CAUSES->(Schizophrenia)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Methylphenidate is the drug of choice for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) as it stimulates the central nervous system, increasing dopamine and norepinephrine levels in the brain, which are crucial for improving attention and focus in ADHD patients. This is supported by evidence paths indicating that norepinephrine and dopamine are involved in treating ADHD. Other options such as Haloperidol, an antipsychotic, and Imipramine, a tricyclic antidepressant, are less effective and not primarily indicated for ADHD. Haloperidol is mainly used for schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders and could potentially worsen ADHD symptoms. Imipramine, though sometimes used off-label for ADHD, is less effective than stimulants and has potential side effects. Alprazolam, a benzodiazepine used for anxiety disorders, is not indicated for ADHD and does not improve the core symptoms of attention or cognitive functions in ADHD patients.\"\n}",
