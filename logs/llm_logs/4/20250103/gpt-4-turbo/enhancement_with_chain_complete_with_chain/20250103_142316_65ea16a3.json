      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Biochemistry.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Nyctalopia is due to deficiency of\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Vitamin A\nopb. Vitamin B\nopc. Vitamin C\nopd. Vitamin E\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Vitamin A deficiency\" -> \"reduced production of rhodopsin\" -> \"impaired adaptation to low-light conditions\" -> \"nyctalopia\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Vitamin B deficiency\" -> \"neurological symptoms\" -> \"possible indirect vision issues\" -> \"unclear link to nyctalopia\" -> 20%\nCHAIN: \"Vitamin C deficiency\" -> \"antioxidant reduction\" -> \"possible increased oxidative stress in eye tissues\" -> \"unclear direct link to nyctalopia\" -> 15%\nCHAIN: \"Vitamin E deficiency\" -> \"antioxidant protection reduced\" -> \"possible retinal damage\" -> \"unclear direct link to nyctalopia\" -> 20%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Vitamin A Deficiency)-PREDISPOSES->(Pathogenesis)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Rhodopsin)\n(Vitamin A Deficiency)-CAUSES->(Degenerative abnormality)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Rhodopsin)\n(Retina)-LOCATION_OF->(Night Blindness)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Nyctalopia, commonly known as night blindness, is primarily caused by a deficiency in Vitamin A. This deficiency leads to a reduced production of rhodopsin, a pigment essential for vision in low-light conditions. The evidence paths confirm the association between Vitamin A deficiency and disruptions in rhodopsin function, which is crucial for night vision. Other vitamins such as Vitamin B, Vitamin C, and Vitamin E deficiencies do not have a direct, well-established link to causing nyctalopia, as their deficiencies typically lead to other health issues without a direct or clear connection to impaired night vision.\"\n}",
