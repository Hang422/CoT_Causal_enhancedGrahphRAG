  "response": "### Enhanced Information Summary\n\nAldosterone is a hormone that plays a crucial role in regulating sodium and water balance in the body, primarily by acting on the kidneys. The primary site of aldosterone action is the collecting duct of the nephron. Here, aldosterone binds to mineralocorticoid receptors, which leads to increased sodium reabsorption and potassium excretion. This process is essential for maintaining blood pressure and electrolyte balance.\n\nThe reasoning chain for the collecting duct accurately reflects this mechanism, stating that aldosterone binds to mineralocorticoid receptors and increases sodium reabsorption specifically in this part of the nephron. The evidence path confirming aldosterone's interaction with mineralocorticoid receptors supports this chain and aligns well with medical consensus.\n\nFor the other options:\n- The glomerulus is primarily involved in the filtration of blood, not directly influenced by aldosterone. The reasoning chain and evidence paths suggest an unclear effect of aldosterone here, which is consistent with the consensus that aldosterone's action is not significant at this site.\n- The proximal convoluted tubule primarily reabsorbs nutrients, water, and electrolytes passively and is not a significant site for aldosterone action. The reasoning chain correctly identifies that aldosterone's effect here is not significant.\n- The loop of Henle, involved in creating a concentration gradient in the medulla of the kidney, does not have a significant role for aldosterone. The reasoning chain correctly notes that aldosterone is not active in this part of the nephron.\n\nIn conclusion, the most accurate and consensus-aligned answer to where aldosterone acts is the collecting duct. This is supported by both the specific reasoning chain and the relevant interaction evidence with mineralocorticoid receptors.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Aldosterone primarily acts at the collecting duct of the nephron, where it binds to mineralocorticoid receptors to increase sodium reabsorption and potassium excretion, crucial for maintaining blood pressure and electrolyte balance.

Other nephron segments like the glomerulus, proximal convoluted tubule, and loop of Henle do not play significant roles in aldosterone's function.\"\n}\n```",
