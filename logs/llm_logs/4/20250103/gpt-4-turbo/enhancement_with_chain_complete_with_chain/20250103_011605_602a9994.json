  "response": "### Enhanced Information Summary\n\nPropranolol, a non-selective beta-blocker, is known for its effects on reducing sympathetic nervous system activity, which leads to a decrease in heart rate and contractility. This mechanism makes it useful in conditions where a reduction in heart rate and contractility is beneficial.\n\n1. **Atrial Flutter**: Propranolol is effective in managing atrial flutter due to its ability to decrease heart rate, which can help in controlling this arrhythmia. This aligns well with medical consensus.\n\n2. **Parkinsonian Tremor**: Although propranolol is used to treat essential tremor, its effectiveness in Parkinsonian tremor is less established. Parkinsonian tremor primarily results from dopamine deficiency and is less influenced by sympathetic nervous system activity. The retrieved evidence path linking tremor broadly to Parkinsonian tremor does not specifically support the use of propranolol for Parkinsonian tremors, as this is not a primary treatment recommended in standard medical guidelines.\n\n3. **Thyrotoxicosis**: Propranolol is beneficial in thyrotoxicosis for symptomatic control, particularly in reducing symptoms like tremor, anxiety, and tachycardia, by blocking beta receptors. This is a well-supported use in medical literature.\n\n4. **Hypertrophic Obstructive Cardiomyopathy (HOCM)**: In HOCM, the decrease in heart rate and contractility caused by propranolol may actually worsen symptoms by increasing the duration of ventricular filling and exacerbating outflow obstruction. This makes propranolol generally not recommended in HOCM, aligning with the consensus that beta-blockers should be used cautiously in this condition.\n\n**Conclusion**: Based on the corrected reasoning and medical consensus, propranolol is not useful in Parkinsonian tremor and HOCM, with its use in HOCM being more clearly contraindicated due to potential exacerbation of symptoms. The evidence supports its use in atrial flutter and thyrotoxicosis. Therefore, the best answer to the question \"Propranolol is useful in all except\" would be Parkinsonian tremor, considering the broader medical guidelines and typical treatment strategies.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Propranolol, a non-selective beta-blocker, effectively reduces heart rate and contractility, making it useful in atrial flutter and thyrotoxicosis. However, its role in Parkinsonian tremor is not well-supported, as this condition primarily stems from dopamine deficiency rather than excessive sympathetic activity. In HOCM, propranolol may worsen symptoms by increasing ventricular filling time and exacerbating outflow obstruction, making it generally not recommended.\"\n}\n```",
