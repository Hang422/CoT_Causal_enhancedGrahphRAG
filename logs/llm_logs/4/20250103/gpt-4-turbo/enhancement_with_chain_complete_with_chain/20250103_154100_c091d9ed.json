      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Physiology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Major hormone secreted by zona reticularis of adrenal coex ?\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Glucocoicoids\nopb. Mineralcoicoids\nopc. Aldosterone\nopd. Androgens\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Zona reticularis of adrenal cortex\" -> \"Secretes sex steroids\" -> \"Primarily produces androgens\" -> \"Androgens\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Zona reticularis of adrenal cortex\" -> \"Produces steroid hormones\" -> \"Androgens are a type of steroid hormone\" -> \"Androgens\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Zona reticularis of adrenal cortex\" -> \"Part of adrenal gland\" -> \"Adrenal gland produces various hormones\" -> \"Androgens are among these hormones\" -> \"Androgens\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Zona reticularis of adrenal cortex\" -> \"Located in innermost layer of adrenal cortex\" -> \"Known for synthesizing dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA)\" -> \"DHEA is an androgen\" -> \"Androgens\" -> 95%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Zona Reticularis)-LOCATION_OF->(Androgens)-ISA->(Steroid hormone)\n(Steroid hormone)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Androgens)\n(Hormones)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Androgens)\n(Adrenal Cortex)-LOCATION_OF->(dehydroepiandrosterone)\n(dehydroepiandrosterone)-INTERACTS_WITH/ISA->(Androgens)\n(Zona Reticularis)-PART_OF->(Brain)-LOCATION_OF->(Steroid hormone)\n(Adrenal Glands)-LOCATION_OF->(Genes)-INTERACTS_WITH/ISA->(Hormones)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"The zona reticularis of the adrenal cortex primarily secretes androgens, which are a type of steroid hormone. This is supported by the evidence that the zona reticularis is known for synthesizing dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), a precursor to androgens. The retrieved evidence paths confirm that the zona reticularis is a location of androgen production and that DHEA is an androgen. This aligns with the medical consensus that the innermost layer of the adrenal cortex, the zona reticularis, is primarily involved in the production of sex steroids, specifically androgens.\"\n}",
