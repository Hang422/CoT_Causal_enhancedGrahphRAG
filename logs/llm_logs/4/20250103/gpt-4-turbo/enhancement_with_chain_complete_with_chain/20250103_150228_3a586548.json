      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Physiology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Digestion of disaccharides occurs at ?\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Mouth\nopb. Stomach\nopc. Small intestine\nopd. Large intestine\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Disaccharides ingestion\" -> \"Salivary amylase in mouth begins starch breakdown, not disaccharides\" -> \"Disaccharides remain intact\" -> \"Small intestine\" -> \"Disaccharidases like lactase, sucrase break down disaccharides into monosaccharides\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Disaccharides ingestion\" -> \"Stomach acid deactivates salivary amylase\" -> \"No significant disaccharide digestion in stomach\" -> \"Small intestine\" -> \"Enzymatic action on disaccharides\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Disaccharides reach large intestine\" -> \"No significant disaccharide-digesting enzymes present\" -> \"Fermentation by microbiota, not digestion\" -> \"Incorrect location for disaccharide digestion\" -> 5%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Disaccharides)-CAUSES->(Disease)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(biological adaptation to stress)-PROCESS_OF->(Intestines, Small)\n(Disaccharides)-CAUSES->(Diastasis)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(biological adaptation to stress)-PROCESS_OF->(Intestines, Small)\n(Intestines, Small)-LOCATION_OF->(Disaccharides)\n(Disaccharides)-CAUSES->(Disease)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Excretory function)-PROCESS_OF->(Intestines, Small)\n(Stomach)-PART_OF->(Intestines, Small)\n(Disaccharides)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Enzymes)\n(Intestines)-LOCATION_OF->(Enzymes)\n(Disaccharides)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Fructose)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Starch)\n(Disaccharides)-ISA->(Sugars)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Starch)\n(Starch)-ISA->(Polysaccharides)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Disaccharides)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Digestion of disaccharides primarily occurs in the small intestine. Disaccharides such as sucrose, lactose, and maltose are not significantly broken down in the mouth as salivary amylase targets polysaccharides like starch, not disaccharides. In the stomach, the acidic environment deactivates salivary amylase, and no specific enzymes for disaccharide digestion are present. Once disaccharides reach the small intestine, specific enzymes called disaccharidases (including lactase, sucrase, and maltase) break them down into monosaccharides, which can then be absorbed. This process is supported by evidence indicating the presence of disaccharides and relevant enzymes in the small intestine. The large intestine does not play a significant role in the digestion of disaccharides, as it lacks the necessary enzymes, and any disaccharides reaching this region are typically fermented by microbiota rather than digested.\"\n}",
