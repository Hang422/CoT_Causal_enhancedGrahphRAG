      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        The following statements regarding insulin resistance in diabetic patients are true except:\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. It is more common with huminsulin\nopb. It may occur in the presence of infections\nopc. It may be due to antibodies to insulin\nopd. Use of glucocorticoids may be useful in severe cases\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Huminsulin\" -> \"synthetic human insulin\" -> \"similar resistance profile to other insulin types\" -> \"unlikely to be more common with huminsulin\" -> 20%\nCHAIN: \"Infections\" -> \"stress response in body\" -> \"increased counter-regulatory hormones\" -> \"increased insulin resistance\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Antibodies to insulin\" -> \"immune response against insulin\" -> \"reduced insulin efficacy\" -> \"increased insulin resistance\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Glucocorticoids\" -> \"increase in blood glucose levels\" -> \"worsen insulin resistance\" -> \"not useful in severe cases of insulin resistance\" -> 15%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Glucocorticoids)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Insulin)-CAUSES->(Finding of blood glucose level)\n(Finding of blood glucose level)-PREDISPOSES->(Disease)-CAUSES->(Insulin Resistance)\n(Finding of blood glucose level)-PREDISPOSES->(Obesity)-CAUSES->(Insulin Resistance)\n(Finding of blood glucose level)-PREDISPOSES->(Diabetes Mellitus, Insulin-Dependent)-CAUSES->(Insulin Resistance)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"The statement that use of glucocorticoids may be useful in severe cases of insulin resistance is incorrect. Glucocorticoids are known to increase blood glucose levels and exacerbate insulin resistance, making them counterproductive in managing severe insulin resistance. This is supported by evidence showing that glucocorticoids interact with insulin to cause elevated blood glucose levels, which predisposes individuals to insulin resistance. The other statements are accurate: insulin resistance can indeed occur in the presence of infections due to a stress-induced increase in counter-regulatory hormones, and it may be due to antibodies to insulin which reduce insulin efficacy. Additionally, huminsulin, being a synthetic form of human insulin, does not have a higher incidence of insulin resistance compared to other types of insulin.\"\n}",
