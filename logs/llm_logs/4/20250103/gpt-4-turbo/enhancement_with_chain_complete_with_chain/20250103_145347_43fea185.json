      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        All of the following are true about Nizatidine except\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. It is a H2 blocker used in peptic ulcer disease\nopb. It has 100% Bioavailability\nopc. It also enhances gastric emptying\nopd. It can also lead to tachycardia\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Nizatidine\" -> \"H2 receptor antagonist\" -> \"used in peptic ulcer disease\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Nizatidine\" -> \"H2 receptor antagonist\" -> \"does not have -> 100%\nCHAIN: \"Nizatidine\" -> \"H2 receptor antagonist\" -> \"no significant effect on gastric emptying\" -> \"does not enhance gastric emptying\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Nizatidine\" -> \"H2 receptor antagonist\" -> \"possible side effects include cardiovascular effects\" -> \"can lead to tachycardia\" -> 80%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Nizatidine)-TREATS->(Disease)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Virus)-LOCATION_OF->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Histamine H2 Antagonists)\n(Nizatidine)-TREATS->(Parkinson Disease)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Virus)-LOCATION_OF->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Histamine H2 Antagonists)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "### Enhanced Information Summary\n\n1. **Nizatidine as an H2 Blocker in Peptic Ulcer Disease**:\n   - **Consensus**: Nizatidine is indeed a histamine H2 receptor antagonist, commonly used in the treatment of peptic ulcer disease. This aligns with the standard pharmacological classification and therapeutic use of H2 blockers.\n   - **Chain Verification**: The chain correctly identifies Nizatidine as an H2 receptor antagonist used for peptic ulcer disease. This is a well-established fact in pharmacology.\n\n2. **Bioavailability of Nizatidine**:\n   - **Consensus**: Nizatidine does not have 100% bioavailability when administered orally. Typical oral bioavailability of Nizatidine is around 70-90%, which is less than 100%.\n   - **Chain Verification**: The chain stating that Nizatidine does not have 100% bioavailability is correct and aligns with pharmacokinetic data.\n\n3. **Effect of Nizatidine on Gastric Emptying**:\n   - **Consensus**: Nizatidine has no significant effect on gastric emptying. It primarily works by reducing gastric acid secretion through H2 receptor antagonism.\n   - **Chain Verification**: The chain correctly notes that Nizatidine does not enhance gastric emptying, which is consistent with its pharmacodynamic profile.\n\n4. **Nizatidine Leading to Tachycardia**:\n   - **Consensus**: While H2 blockers can have cardiovascular side effects, tachycardia is not a commonly reported side effect of Nizatidine. More common side effects include headache, dizziness, and gastrointestinal disturbances.\n   - **Chain Verification**: The chain suggesting that Nizatidine can lead to tachycardia is less supported by clinical evidence and consensus. This side effect is not typically associated with Nizatidine, making this claim less accurate.\n\n5. **Relevance of Evidence Paths**:\n   - The provided evidence paths are overly broad and do not directly support the specific pharmacological properties or side effects of Nizatidine. They link Nizatidine to general categories of diseases and pharmaceutical preparations without providing specific, actionable insights into the drug's bioavailability, effects on gastric emptying, or cardiovascular side effects.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe most accurate statement that does not align with medical consensus regarding Nizatidine is that it has 100% bioavailability. This statement is incorrect as the bioavailability of Nizatidine is less than 100%. The other statements, except for the claim about tachycardia, align well with established pharmacological knowledge. The claim about tachycardia, while possible, is not strongly supported by typical clinical data associated with Nizatidine.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Nizatidine is a histamine H2 receptor antagonist used in peptic ulcer disease with a bioavailability less than 100%, and it does not significantly affect gastric emptying. The claim of 100% bioavailability is incorrect, and while it can have cardiovascular side effects, tachycardia is not a commonly reported side effect.\"\n}\n```",
