      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Which of the following drugs is used to treat both diabetes mellitus and diabetes insipidus\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Chlorpropamide\nopb. Glibenclamide\nopc. Glicazide\nopd. Glipizide\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Chlorpropamide\" -> \"increases insulin secretion\" -> \"lowers blood glucose in diabetes mellitus\" -> \"enhances ADH effect in kidney\" -> \"reduces urine output in diabetes insipidus\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Glibenclamide\" -> \"stimulates insulin release\" -> \"controls blood sugar in diabetes mellitus\" -> \"no effect on ADH or urine output\" -> \"not used for diabetes insipidus\" -> 10%\nCHAIN: \"Glicazide\" -> \"promotes insulin secretion\" -> \"manages hyperglycemia in diabetes mellitus\" -> \"no action on ADH pathways\" -> \"ineffective for diabetes insipidus\" -> 10%\nCHAIN: \"Glipizide\" -> \"triggers insulin release\" -> \"treats high blood sugar in diabetes mellitus\" -> \"does not influence ADH activity\" -> \"not applicable for diabetes insipidus treatment\" -> 10%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Glipizide)-ASSOCIATED_WITH/TREATS->(Diabetes)-CAUSES->(Tachycardia)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Insulin)\n(Insulin)-CAUSES->(Diabetes Mellitus)\n(Glyburide)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Insulin)\n(Insulin)-CAUSES->(Hyperglycemia)\n(Diabetes Mellitus)-PREDISPOSES->(arterial stiffness)-PROCESS_OF->(Kidney)\n(Diabetes Mellitus)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Immunity)-PROCESS_OF->(Kidney)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "### Enhanced Information Summary\n\nChlorpropamide is a sulfonylurea class drug that is primarily used to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus by increasing insulin secretion, which helps lower blood glucose levels. Unlike other sulfonylureas, chlorpropamide also has a unique property of enhancing the effect of antidiuretic hormone (ADH), which can be beneficial in the treatment of diabetes insipidus, particularly the mild central form. This dual functionality makes chlorpropamide distinct among the options listed, as it can address both diabetes mellitus and diabetes insipidus.\n\nThe other drugs listed - Glibenclamide, Glicazide, and Glipizide - are also sulfonylureas that stimulate insulin release to control blood sugar in diabetes mellitus. However, they do not have an effect on ADH activity or the management of diabetes insipidus. This aligns with the medical consensus that these drugs are specifically effective for diabetes mellitus but not for diabetes insipidus.\n\nThe retrieved evidence paths, while broad, confirm the role of insulin in managing diabetes mellitus but do not provide additional specific insights into the treatment of diabetes insipidus with any of the drugs listed. Therefore, these paths do not alter the conclusion drawn from the medical consensus and the specific properties of chlorpropamide.\n\nIn conclusion, among the options provided, chlorpropamide is the only drug used to treat both diabetes mellitus and diabetes insipidus, leveraging its ability to increase insulin secretion and enhance ADH effect.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Chlorpropamide is unique among the listed drugs as it treats both diabetes mellitus and diabetes insipidus by increasing insulin secretion and enhancing ADH effect. Other sulfonylureas like Glibenclamide, Glicazide, and Glipizide are effective in treating diabetes mellitus but do not impact ADH activity or treat diabetes insipidus.\"\n}\n```",
