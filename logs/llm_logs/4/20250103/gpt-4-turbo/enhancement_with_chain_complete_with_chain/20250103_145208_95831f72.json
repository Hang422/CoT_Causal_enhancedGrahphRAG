      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Biochemistry.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        SACD (Subacute combined degeneration of cord) is feature of which vitamin deficiency?\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Vitamin A\nopb. Vitamin B6\nopc. Vitamin B9\nopd. Vitamin B12\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Vitamin B12 deficiency\" -> \"disruption in myelin synthesis\" -> \"demyelination in the spinal cord\" -> \"Subacute combined degeneration of cord (SACD)\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Vitamin B6 deficiency\" -> \"neurological symptoms\" -> \"possible confusion with SACD\" -> \"unlikely cause of SACD\" -> 10%\nCHAIN: \"Vitamin A deficiency\" -> \"affects vision and immune function\" -> \"not directly linked to myelin or spinal cord health\" -> \"not a cause of SACD\" -> 5%\nCHAIN: \"Vitamin B9 deficiency\" -> \"leads to anemia and other hematological issues\" -> \"possible neurological complications\" -> \"not typically causing SACD\" -> 15%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Folic Acid Deficiency)-CAUSES->(Anemia)\n(Demyelination)-CAUSES->(Guillain-Barre Syndrome)-CAUSES->(Subacute combined degeneration of spinal cord)\n(Vitamin B 6 Deficiency)-CAUSES->(Neurologic Symptoms)\n(Anemia)-CAUSES->(NEUROLOGIC COMPLICATION)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord (SACD) is primarily associated with Vitamin B12 deficiency. This deficiency leads to a disruption in myelin synthesis, which is crucial for nerve fiber protection and signal transmission. The resulting demyelination specifically affects the spinal cord, leading directly to SACD. The evidence path linking demyelination to neurological disorders like Guillain-Barre Syndrome, although correct, is not directly relevant to SACD but confirms the role of demyelination in severe neurological conditions. Other vitamins such as Vitamin B6, Vitamin A, and Vitamin B9, though they have roles in neurological health or anemia, do not directly cause SACD. Vitamin B6 deficiency does lead to neurological symptoms, but these do not typically manifest as SACD. Vitamin A affects vision and immune function but has no direct link to myelin synthesis or spinal cord health. Vitamin B9 deficiency can lead to anemia and might have neurological complications, but it is not a typical cause of SACD.\"\n}",
