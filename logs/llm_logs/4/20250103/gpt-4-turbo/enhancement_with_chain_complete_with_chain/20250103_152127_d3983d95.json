      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Physiology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Lipids are transferred from intestine to liver by\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Chylomicrons\nopb. VLDL\nopc. HDL\nopd. LDL\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Chylomicrons\" -> \"absorb dietary lipids in the intestine\" -> \"transport lipids through lymphatic system\" -> \"deliver lipids to liver\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"VLDL\" -> \"produced by the liver\" -> \"transports lipids from liver to tissues\" -> \"does not transport lipids from intestine to liver\" -> 10%\nCHAIN: \"HDL\" -> \"involved in reverse cholesterol transport\" -> \"transports cholesterol from tissues to liver\" -> \"does not primarily transport lipids from intestine to liver\" -> 15%\nCHAIN: \"LDL\" -> \"formed from VLDL in bloodstream\" -> \"carries cholesterol to peripheral tissues\" -> \"does not transport lipids from intestine to liver\" -> 10%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Chylomicrons)-CAUSES->(uptake)-PROCESS_OF->(Intestines)\n(Liver)-PART_OF->(Intestines)\n(Body tissue)-PART_OF->(Liver)\n(Low-Density Lipoproteins)-TREATS->(Disease)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Blood Circulation)\n(Low-Density Lipoproteins)-TREATS->(Infection)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Blood Circulation)\n(Low-Density Lipoproteins)-TREATS->(Cardiovascular Diseases)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Blood Circulation)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Chylomicrons are the primary lipoproteins responsible for transporting dietary lipids from the intestine to the liver. After lipids are absorbed in the intestine, they are packaged into chylomicrons, which then travel through the lymphatic system before reaching the bloodstream and ultimately delivering lipids to the liver. This pathway is supported by the evidence path linking chylomicrons with the uptake process in the intestines. In contrast, VLDL, HDL, and LDL are involved in lipid transport processes that do not primarily include the transfer of lipids from the intestine to the liver. VLDL transports lipids from the liver to various tissues, HDL is mainly involved in reverse cholesterol transport from tissues back to the liver, and LDL primarily carries cholesterol from the liver to peripheral tissues. These functions do not align with the lipid transfer from the intestine to the liver, as required by the question.\"\n}",
