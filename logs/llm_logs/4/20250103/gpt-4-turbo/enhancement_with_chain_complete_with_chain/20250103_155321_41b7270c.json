Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4.

Tirofiban\nopd. Prasugrel\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Abciximab\" -> \"Gp2b3A inhibitor\" -> 95% CHAIN: \"Eptifibatide\" -> \"Gp2b3A inhibitor\" -> 95% CHAIN: \"Tirofiban\" -> \"Gp2b3A inhibitor\" -> 95% CHAIN: \"Prasugrel\" -> \"Not a Gp2b3A inhibitor\" -> \"Thienopyridine class\" -> \"Inhibits platelet activation by blocking ADP receptors\" -> 95%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(thienopyridine)-TREATS->(Kidney Failure, Chronic)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Virus)-LOCATION_OF->(Liposomes)-LOCATION_OF->(Medical Imaging)-DIAGNOSES->(Mental blocking)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "### Enhanced Information Summary\n\nThe question asks to identify which among the listed options is not a Gp2b3A inhibitor. Gp2b3A inhibitors are a class of antiplatelet drugs that prevent platelet aggregation by blocking the glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor on the surface of platelets.\n\n1. **Abciximab** is correctly identified as a Gp2b3A inhibitor. It is a monoclonal antibody that binds to the glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor, inhibiting platelet aggregation.\n\n2. **Eptifibatide** is also correctly identified as a Gp2b3A inhibitor. It is a cyclic heptapeptide that binds to the glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor.\n\n3. **Tirofiban** is accurately described as a Gp2b3A inhibitor. It is a non-peptide antagonist of the glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor.\n\n4. **Prasugrel**, however, is not a Gp2b3A inhibitor. It belongs to the thienopyridine class and works by inhibiting platelet activation through the blockade of ADP receptors, not glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptors.\n\nThe retrieved evidence paths discussing thienopyridines and their broad medical implications do not directly support the specific pharmacological action of Prasugrel concerning the question. Therefore, this path is not relevant to the decision-making process here.\n\nIn conclusion, the correct answer to the question \"Gp2b3A inhibitors are all except\" is **Prasugrel**. This decision is based on the standard pharmacological classification and mechanism of action of the drugs listed, aligning with medical consensus.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Abciximab, Eptifibatide, and Tirofiban are Gp2b3A inhibitors, which block the glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor on platelets to prevent aggregation. Prasugrel, however, is not a Gp2b3A inhibitor; it belongs to the thienopyridine class and inhibits platelet activation by blocking ADP receptors. Therefore, the correct answer is Prasugrel.\"\n}\n```",
