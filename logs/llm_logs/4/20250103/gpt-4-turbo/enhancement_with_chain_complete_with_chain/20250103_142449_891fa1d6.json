      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Which of the following antitussive can lead to hallucinations\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Morphine\nopb. Dextromethorphan\nopc. Diphenhydramine\nopd. Aprepitant\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Dextromethorphan\" -> \"acts on central nervous system\" -> \"can cause dissociative effects\" -> \"possible hallucinations\" -> 75%\nCHAIN: \"Morphine\" -> \"opioid receptor agonist\" -> \"primarily causes euphoria and pain relief\" -> \"hallucinations not commonly reported\" -> 20%\nCHAIN: \"Diphenhydramine\" -> \"anticholinergic properties\" -> \"can cross blood-brain barrier\" -> \"possible confusion and hallucinations in high doses\" -> 60%\nCHAIN: \"Aprepitant\" -> \"substance P/neurokinin 1 receptor antagonist\" -> \"used to prevent chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting\" -> \"hallucinations not a known side effect\" -> 10%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Morphine)-INTERACTS_WITH/ISA->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Opioids)\n(Diphenhydramine)-ISA->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Anticholinergic Agents)\n(Opioids)-PART_OF->(Brain)-PART_OF->(Muscle)-LOCATION_OF->(Pain relief)\n(Opioids)-PART_OF->(Brain)-PART_OF->(Nerve)-LOCATION_OF->(Pain relief)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Dextromethorphan, an antitussive that acts on the central nervous system, can cause dissociative effects including possible hallucinations, aligning with its known side effects at high doses. Diphenhydramine, with anticholinergic properties, can also lead to confusion and hallucinations, particularly in high doses, due to its ability to cross the blood-brain barrier. Morphine, primarily an opioid receptor agonist, is associated with euphoria and pain relief, and hallucinations are not commonly reported with its use. Aprepitant, functioning as a substance P/neurokinin 1 receptor antagonist, is used to prevent chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, with no known side effects of hallucinations. The evidence paths confirm the classifications and primary effects of these drugs but do not directly address the occurrence of hallucinations.\"\n}",
