      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Physiology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Which of the following is not carried in dorsal column of spinal cord:March 2011\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Proprioception\nopb. Vibratory sense\nopc. Heat sensation\nopd. Touch\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Dorsal column of spinal cord\" -> \"carries proprioception\" -> \"Proprioception is correctly associated with dorsal column\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Dorsal column of spinal cord\" -> \"carries vibratory sense\" -> \"Vibratory sense is correctly associated with dorsal column\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Dorsal column of spinal cord\" -> \"does not carry heat sensation\" -> \"Heat sensation is not associated with dorsal column\" -> 98%\nCHAIN: \"Dorsal column of spinal cord\" -> \"carries touch\" -> \"Touch is correctly associated with dorsal column\" -> 95%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Dorsal funiculus)-LOCATION_OF->(SLIT2 gene|SLIT3|SLIT2)-PART_OF->(Endothelium)-LOCATION_OF->(Therapeutic tactile stimulation)\n(Spinal Cord)-LOCATION_OF->(ARSE)-PART_OF->(Prostatic Tissue)-LOCATION_OF->(Therapeutic tactile stimulation)\n(Spinal Cord)-LOCATION_OF->(ARSE)-PART_OF->(Body tissue)-LOCATION_OF->(Therapeutic tactile stimulation)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "### Enhanced Information Summary\n\nThe dorsal columns of the spinal cord are primarily responsible for carrying sensory modalities such as proprioception, vibratory sense, and fine touch. These functions are well-documented in medical literature and align with the physiological understanding of the sensory pathways in the human nervous system.\n\n1. **Proprioception**: The dorsal column is known to carry proprioceptive information from the body to the brain. This is a consensus in neurophysiology, and the reasoning chain provided aligns with this understanding.\n\n2. **Vibratory Sense**: Similarly, the vibratory sense is transmitted via the dorsal columns. This is a standard teaching in neuroanatomy and is correctly reflected in the reasoning chain.\n\n3. **Heat Sensation**: Heat sensation, however, is not transmitted via the dorsal columns. Instead, it is carried by the spinothalamic tract, which is a different pathway in the spinal cord. The reasoning chain correctly identifies that heat sensation is not associated with the dorsal column, aligning with medical consensus.\n\n4. **Touch**: The dorsal column does carry information related to fine touch. However, it is important to specify that this refers to fine or discriminative touch, as crude touch is transmitted through other pathways like the spinothalamic tract.\n\nThe retrieved evidence paths, while correct in their broader anatomical context, do not provide direct or specific information relevant to the sensory modalities carried by the dorsal columns. Therefore, these paths do not contribute to the decision-making process for this specific question and are not included in the enhanced information.\n\nIn conclusion, the option that is not carried in the dorsal column of the spinal cord is \"Heat sensation\" (opc). The reasoning chains for the other options correctly align with the standard medical consensus on the function of the dorsal columns in sensory transmission.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"The dorsal columns of the spinal cord are responsible for carrying proprioception, vibratory sense, and fine touch.
