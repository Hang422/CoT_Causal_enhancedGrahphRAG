  "response": "### Enhanced Information Summary\n\nThe question asks to identify which of the listed options is not an enzymatic marker of the plasma membrane. \n\n1. **5'-nucleotidase** is indeed a marker of the plasma membrane, involved in the hydrolysis of nucleotide monophosphates. This is well-supported by physiological consensus and is correctly included in the options as a plasma membrane marker.\n\n2. **Adenylyl cyclase** is also a marker of the plasma membrane. It catalyzes the conversion of ATP to cyclic AMP and is integral to signal transduction pathways. The evidence paths provided, linking adenylyl cyclase with cyclic AMP and phosphatidic acid, both components associated with the cell membrane, reinforce its role as a plasma membrane marker.\n\n3. **Na+-K+-ATPase** is a well-known plasma membrane marker, crucial for maintaining the electrochemical gradient across the plasma membrane by pumping sodium out of and potassium into the cell. This is a standard fact in physiology, and its inclusion as a plasma membrane marker is accurate.\n\n4. **Galactosyl transferase**, however, is primarily associated with the Golgi apparatus, where it functions in the glycosylation of proteins. The reasoning chain correctly identifies it as not a marker of the plasma membrane but of the Golgi apparatus. This is aligned with standard biochemical consensus and is supported by the absence of contradicting evidence paths.\n\nIn conclusion, the enzymatic marker not associated with the plasma membrane among the options provided is **Galactosyl transferase**. The reasoning chains for the other options align well with standard medical consensus and are supported by the evidence paths where applicable.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Among the options provided, 5'-nucleotidase, Adenylyl cyclase, and Na+-K+-ATPase are confirmed enzymatic markers of the plasma membrane, supported by physiological consensus and relevant evidence paths.
