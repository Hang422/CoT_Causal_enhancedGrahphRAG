      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Biochemistry.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Which of the following fat soluble vitamin has been  identified to function as a coenzyme?\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Vitamin A\nopb. Vitamin K\nopc. Vitamin E\nopd. Vitamin D\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Vitamin A\" -> \"functions in vision, immune function, and cell growth\" -> \"not primarily a coenzyme\" -> 10%\nCHAIN: \"Vitamin K\" -> \"functions in blood clotting and bone metabolism\" -> \"acts as a coenzyme in the carboxylation of glutamic acid residues\" -> \"identified as a coenzyme\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Vitamin E\" -> \"functions as an antioxidant\" -> \"protects cell membranes from oxidation\" -> \"not identified as a coenzyme\" -> 10%\nCHAIN: \"Vitamin D\" -> \"regulates calcium and phosphate metabolism\" -> \"promotes bone and immune health\" -> \"not identified as a coenzyme\" -> 10%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Vitamin D2)-INTERACTS_WITH->(calcium)\n(Vitamin E)-INTERACTS_WITH/ISA->(Antioxidants)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Vitamin K is identified as a coenzyme, functioning in the carboxylation of glutamic acid residues, which is essential for blood clotting and bone metabolism. This aligns with medical consensus that recognizes Vitamin K's coenzyme role in activating proteins involved in these processes. Other vitamins listed, such as Vitamin A, Vitamin E, and Vitamin D, do not function as coenzymes. Vitamin A is crucial for vision, immune function, and cell growth; Vitamin E acts primarily as an antioxidant protecting cell membranes; and Vitamin D regulates calcium and phosphate metabolism, promoting bone and immune health. The evidence paths provided do not directly support the coenzyme function of any vitamins but confirm the roles of Vitamin D and E in other biochemical processes.\"\n}",
