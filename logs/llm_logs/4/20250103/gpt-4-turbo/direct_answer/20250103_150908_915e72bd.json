  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"The stomach secretes several substances that aid in digestion, including hydrochloric acid (HCl) and pepsinogens, which are precursors to the enzyme pepsin. Lipase is primarily secreted by the pancreas, although gastric lipase is also secreted by the stomach but in much smaller amounts compared to pancreatic lipase. However, the question likely refers to the primary source of lipase in the digestive system, which is the pancreas, not the stomach.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opa\",\n    \"confidence\": 85\n}",
