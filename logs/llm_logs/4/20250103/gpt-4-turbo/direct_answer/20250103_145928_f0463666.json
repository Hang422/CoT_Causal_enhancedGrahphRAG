  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Ketoacidosis, particularly in the context of diabetes mellitus, is primarily characterized by an increased glucagon/insulin ratio. This imbalance leads to elevated blood glucose levels due to decreased insulin activity, which fails to facilitate glucose uptake by cells, and increased glucagon, which promotes gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis. Additionally, the lack of insulin stimulates the breakdown of fat, leading to an increase in free fatty acids and their conversion into ketone bodies, further contributing to acidosis. The key features are thus an increased glucagon/insulin ratio, elevated blood glucose, and increased free fatty acids.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opa\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}",
