  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Propranolol is a non-selective beta-blocker used in various cardiovascular conditions and other medical scenarios. It is effective in managing symptoms of thyrotoxicosis (opc) and hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM, opd) by reducing heart rate and myocardial contractility. It is also used off-label for treating Parkinsonian tremor (opb) by alleviating tremor symptoms. However, it is generally not the first choice for atrial flutter (opa) as it does not directly convert atrial flutter to normal sinus rhythm but may slow ventricular rate.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opa\",\n    \"confidence\": 90\n}",
