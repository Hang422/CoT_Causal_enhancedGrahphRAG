  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Finasteride is a 5α reductase inhibitor that is used to treat both benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH) and male pattern baldness (androgenetic alopecia). It works by inhibiting the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT), a key factor in both conditions. Flutamide is an antiandrogen but not a 5α reductase inhibitor, Prazosin is an alpha-blocker used for BPH but not for hair loss, and Minoxidil is used for hair growth but acts through a different mechanism unrelated to 5α reductase inhibition.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opb\",\n    \"confidence\": 100\n}",
