  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Atherosclerosis is primarily associated with the accumulation of low-density lipoproteins (LDL) in the arterial walls, leading to plaque formation. Apo protein E plays a crucial role in lipid metabolism and its deficiency can lead to improper clearance of chylomicrons and VLDL remnants, contributing to the development of atherosclerosis. Therefore, Apo protein E deficiency is directly linked to the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opb\",\n    \"confidence\": 85\n}",
