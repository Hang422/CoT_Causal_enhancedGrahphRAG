  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Hyperammonemia is a condition characterized by elevated levels of ammonia in the blood, which is often associated with defects in the urea cycle. The urea cycle is a series of biochemical steps in the liver that convert ammonia to urea, which is then excreted in the urine. Argininosuccinate synthetase, Carbamoyl Phosphate Synthetase I (CPS-I), and Ornithine Transcarbamoylase (OTC) are all enzymes involved in the urea cycle. Deficiencies in these enzymes can lead to disruptions in the cycle, resulting in the accumulation of ammonia. However, Ornithine Amino Transferase is involved in the metabolism of ornithine in the urea cycle but primarily functions in the synthesis of proline and glutamate-semialdehyde, pathways not directly involved in ammonia detoxification. Therefore, its deficiency typically leads to gyrate atrophy of the choroid and retina but not hyperammonemia.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opd\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}",
