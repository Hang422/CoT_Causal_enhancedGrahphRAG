  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"The lung has several metabolic functions, including the inactivation of certain substances and the conversion of others. One of the most significant and well-known functions is the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II. This conversion is facilitated by the enzyme angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) that is highly expressed in the pulmonary endothelium. This process is crucial for the regulation of blood pressure and fluid balance in the body.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opb\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}",
