  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"The symptoms described in the question, including vomiting, lethargy, and severe jaundice upon the introduction of fruit juice, suggest a disorder involving the metabolism of fructose. Aldolase B is the enzyme responsible for breaking down fructose in the liver. A deficiency in Aldolase B leads to hereditary fructose intolerance, which can cause severe reactions to fructose ingestion, including hypoglycemia, jaundice, and liver dysfunction. The other enzymes listed do not directly relate to the symptoms described when fructose is ingested.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opc\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}",
