  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Blood viscosity refers to the thickness and stickiness of blood, which affects how easily it flows through the vessels. In anemia, where there is a decrease in the number of red blood cells or hemoglobin, blood viscosity is actually decreased, not increased, making option 'opa' incorrect. In polycythemia, characterized by an increased number of red blood cells, blood viscosity is increased, not decreased, making option 'opb' incorrect. Cardiac output, which is the volume of blood the heart pumps per minute, is often increased in anemia to compensate for reduced oxygen carrying capacity, making option 'opc' correct. In Beri-Beri, particularly wet Beri-Beri, which affects the cardiovascular system, cardiac output is typically increased due to high-output heart failure, making option 'opd' incorrect.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opc\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}",
