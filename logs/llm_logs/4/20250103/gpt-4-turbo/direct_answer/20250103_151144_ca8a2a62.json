  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"High Density Lipoprotein (HDL) is known for its protective roles against atherosclerosis, primarily by promoting the reverse transport of cholesterol from the arteries to the liver for excretion, reducing oxidation of LDL, and inhibiting the formation of foam cells. However, while HDL levels are inversely related to the risk of coronary artery disease (CAD), it is not the best predictor of CAD. Other factors such as LDL levels and total cholesterol to HDL ratio are more predictive.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opc\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}",
