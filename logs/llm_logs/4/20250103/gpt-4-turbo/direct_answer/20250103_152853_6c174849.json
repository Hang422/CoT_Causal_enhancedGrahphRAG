The core structure of a glycoprotein includes the protein part, which is fundamental. The carbohydrate chains attached to this core protein can vary in length, but they are typically not described as being particularly long. Therefore, the most accurate description of a glycoprotein among the provided options is that it includes a core protein component.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opb\",\n    \"confidence\": 90\n}",
