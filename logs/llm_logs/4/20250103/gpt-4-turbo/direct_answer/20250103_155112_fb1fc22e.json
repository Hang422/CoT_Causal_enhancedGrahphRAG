  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Misoprostol is the drug of choice for peptic ulcer disease caused by chronic use of NSAIDs. It is a prostaglandin analog that helps in protecting the gastric lining by increasing mucus and bicarbonate production and enhancing blood flow, thereby reducing the risk of ulcers. Esomeprazole, a proton pump inhibitor, is also used for treating NSAID-induced ulcers, but Misoprostol is specifically indicated when prevention of these ulcers is required, especially in high-risk patients. Pirenzepine and Loratadine are not appropriate for this condition; Pirenzepine is an antimuscarinic agent used less commonly for peptic ulcers, and Loratadine is an antihistamine used for allergies.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opc\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}",
