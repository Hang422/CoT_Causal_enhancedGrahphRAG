  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Diabetes insipidus is characterized by the inability of the kidneys to concentrate urine, leading to the production of large volumes of dilute urine. Normal urine osmolality ranges from 300 to 900 mmol/kg. In cases of diabetes insipidus, particularly the central or nephrogenic types, the urine osmolality is typically much lower due to the kidney's inability to concentrate urine effectively. A urine osmolality of less than 300 mmol/kg is indicative of diabetes insipidus, aligning with the definition of the condition where the kidneys excrete excessively dilute urine.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opb\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}",
