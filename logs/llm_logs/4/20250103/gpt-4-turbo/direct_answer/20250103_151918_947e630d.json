Pilocarpine is a miotic agent that can help by constricting the pupil and opening the angle. Clozapine, Fluphenazine, and Paroxetine are not used in the treatment of glaucoma. Clozapine and Fluphenazine are antipsychotics, and Paroxetine is an antidepressant, none of which are indicated for acute angle closure glaucoma. Among these, Clozapine is particularly noted for potential adverse effects on the eye, including exacerbation of glaucoma.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opb\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}",
