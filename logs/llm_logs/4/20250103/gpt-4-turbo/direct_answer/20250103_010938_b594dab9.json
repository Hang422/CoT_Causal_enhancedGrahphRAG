  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"The drug of choice for the treatment of bleeding esophageal varices is Octreotide. Octreotide is a somatostatin analog that reduces splanchnic blood flow, thereby helping to control variceal bleeding. Propranolol is used for the prevention of variceal bleeding, not as an acute treatment. Ethanolamine oleate is a sclerosant used in endoscopic procedures, not typically a first-line pharmacological treatment. Phytonadione (Vitamin K) is used to correct coagulopathy, not directly for variceal bleeding.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opb\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}",
