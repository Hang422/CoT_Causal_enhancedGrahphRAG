  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Phenytoin is known for its zero order kinetics, meaning that it is metabolized at a constant rate regardless of its concentration in the blood. This is a distinctive pharmacokinetic property of phenytoin. It is also a hepatic enzyme inducer, which can affect the metabolism of other drugs. Phenytoin is not excreted unchanged in the urine; it undergoes hepatic metabolism before excretion. Additionally, phenytoin is known to be teratogenic, which means it can cause developmental malformations when used during pregnancy.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opa\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}",
