Enzymes such as maltase, sucrase, and lactase in the small intestine break down disaccharides into monosaccharides, which can then be absorbed by the body. While some initial carbohydrate digestion occurs in the mouth through salivary amylase, the specific breakdown of disaccharides predominantly takes place in the small intestine.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opc\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}",
