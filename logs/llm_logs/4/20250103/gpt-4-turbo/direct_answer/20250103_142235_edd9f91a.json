  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Tamoxifen is a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) primarily used in the treatment and prevention of breast cancer. While it acts as an estrogen antagonist in breast tissue, it can exhibit estrogen-like effects in other tissues. One of the known side effects of tamoxifen is its potential to cause endometrial changes, including endometrial hyperplasia. This is due to its estrogenic effects on the uterine lining. It does not typically cause osteoporosis; in fact, it can have protective effects on bone density in postmenopausal women. It is not directly linked to causing ovarian cancer. Regarding lipid levels, tamoxifen has been associated with increased, rather than decreased, triglyceride levels.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opb\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}",
