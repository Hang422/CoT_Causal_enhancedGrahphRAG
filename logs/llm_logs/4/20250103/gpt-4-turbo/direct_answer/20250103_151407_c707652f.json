  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Spironolactone is a potassium-sparing diuretic often used in the treatment of conditions like hypertension, heart failure, and hyperaldosteronism. It can lead to hyperkalemia (high potassium levels in the blood). ACE inhibitors, which also increase potassium levels, when used in combination with spironolactone, can further increase the risk of hyperkalemia. This combination is generally avoided or used with caution and close monitoring.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opc\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}",
