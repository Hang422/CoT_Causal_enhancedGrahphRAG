  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Cardiac muscle shares several features with skeletal muscle, including being striated and utilizing the troponin system for calcium-mediated contraction regulation. It also has large T tubules which facilitate the rapid conduction of action potentials necessary for synchronized contraction. However, caldesmon is not a regulatory protein in cardiac muscle; it is more relevant in smooth muscle regulation.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opd\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}",
