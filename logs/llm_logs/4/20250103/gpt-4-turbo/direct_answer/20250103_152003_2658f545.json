  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Inherited hyperammonemia often results from deficiencies in enzymes involved in the urea cycle, which is crucial for the detoxification of ammonia in the liver. N-acetyl glutamate synthetase is an enzyme that plays a key role in the urea cycle by activating carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I, the first enzyme of the cycle. Deficiency in N-acetyl glutamate synthetase leads to reduced production of carbamoyl phosphate, resulting in hyperammonemia. The other listed enzymes are involved in the citric acid cycle and do not directly impact the urea cycle.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opc\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}",
