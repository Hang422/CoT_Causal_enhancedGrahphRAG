  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Omeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) that blocks the enzyme system of gastric acid secretion in parietal cells, thereby inhibiting both basal and stimulated gastric acid secretion. It does not directly affect cholinergic, histaminergic, or gastrin receptors, making it distinct from the other options listed. Loxatidine and Famotidine are H2 receptor antagonists, and Pirenzepine is a muscarinic antagonist, all of which have specific receptor targets.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opc\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}",
