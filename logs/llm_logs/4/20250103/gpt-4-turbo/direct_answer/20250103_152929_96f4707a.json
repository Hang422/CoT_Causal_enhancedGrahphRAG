  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Tamoxifen is a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) commonly used in the treatment of estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer. It has several known adverse effects, including an increased risk of thromboembolism and endometrial carcinoma due to its estrogenic effects on the blood and endometrium. Tamoxifen is also associated with an increased risk of cataract formation. However, it is used to reduce the risk of developing breast cancer in the contralateral (opposite) breast, making it a protective agent in this context rather than causing carcinoma.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opc\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}",
