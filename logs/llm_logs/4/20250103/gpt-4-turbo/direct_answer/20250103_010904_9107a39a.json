  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Morphine is commonly used in palliative care to relieve dyspnea in patients with advanced diseases such as lung cancer. It helps by reducing the sensation of breathlessness and decreasing the respiratory drive. Diazepam and clobazam, being benzodiazepines, primarily act as anxiolytics and muscle relaxants, and are less effective in directly reducing dyspnea. Haloperidol is an antipsychotic with no primary indication for treating dyspnea.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opa\",\n    \"confidence\": 90\n}",
