  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Progesterone is a key hormone in the female reproductive system, primarily involved in preparing the endometrium for potential pregnancy after ovulation. It is predominantly produced by the corpora lutea, which are structures formed in the ovary after the follicle releases an egg during ovulation. The corpora lutea arise from the remnants of the mature follicle and are responsible for secreting progesterone during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. The other options listed do not primarily produce progesterone: stroma is the connective tissue component of the ovary, corpora albicans are the degenerated remains of the corpora lutea, and while mature follicles produce some hormones, they are not the primary source of progesterone.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opc\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}",
