  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Insulin is a hormone produced by the beta cells of the pancreas, not the alpha cells, which produce glucagon. Insulin consists of two polypeptide chains (A and B chains) that are linked together by disulfide bonds. Insulin facilitates the uptake of potassium into cells, not shifting it outside. The half-life of subcutaneous insulin varies depending on the type, but for regular insulin, it is approximately 5 to 10 minutes in circulation, not 60 minutes.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opb\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}",
