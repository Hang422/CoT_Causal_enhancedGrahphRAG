  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Scabies is a skin condition caused by the mite Sarcoptes scabiei. The primary treatment involves medications that kill the mites and their eggs. Benzene hexachloride, also known as lindane, has been used historically for this purpose, although it is less commonly used today due to safety concerns and the availability of safer alternatives like permethrin and ivermectin. Erythromycin is an antibiotic and not effective against mites. Piperazine is used to treat parasitic worm infections, and thiabendazole is also an antiparasitic used for worm infections, not for mites.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opb\",\n    \"confidence\": 85\n}",
