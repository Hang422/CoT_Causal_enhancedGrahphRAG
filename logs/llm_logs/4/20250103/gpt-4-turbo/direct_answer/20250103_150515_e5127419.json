  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Quinine, used for treating malaria, can cause hypoglycemia as a side effect by stimulating insulin secretion. The symptoms of hypoglycemia include restlessness and sweating, aligning with the patient's symptoms. Cinchonism typically presents with symptoms like tinnitus, headache, and visual disturbances, while arrhythmias would more likely manifest as palpitations or irregular heartbeat. Generalized sweating alone is less specific and does not directly link to quinine administration without other context.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opa\",\n    \"confidence\": 90\n}",
