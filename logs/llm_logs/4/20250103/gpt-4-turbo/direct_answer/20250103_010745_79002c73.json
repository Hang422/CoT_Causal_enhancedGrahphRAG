Bromocriptine is a dopamine agonist that actually reduces prolactin levels, making it a treatment for conditions associated with hyperprolactinemia, such as prolactinomas. On the other hand, Haloperidol, Reserpine, and Chlorpromazine are known to potentially increase prolactin levels as they block dopamine receptors, which normally inhibit prolactin secretion.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opa\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}",
