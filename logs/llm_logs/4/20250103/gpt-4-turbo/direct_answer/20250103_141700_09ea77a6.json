  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Protease activated receptors (PARs) are a family of G protein-coupled receptors, which are indeed activated by proteases such as thrombin. They are known to play roles in inflammation and can lead to the release of prostaglandins like PGE2, and they also have protective roles in epithelial cells. However, the statement that there are only three members in this family is incorrect. There are four known protease activated receptors, PAR1, PAR2, PAR3, and PAR4.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opa\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}",
