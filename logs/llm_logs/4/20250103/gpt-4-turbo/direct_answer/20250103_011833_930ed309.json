  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"The substantia nigra, particularly its part known as the pars compacta, is crucial in the production and transmission of dopamine. The primary target of the dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta is the corpus striatum, which includes the caudate nucleus and the putamen. This pathway is significant in the regulation of movement, and its dysfunction is a key factor in Parkinson's disease.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opb\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}",
