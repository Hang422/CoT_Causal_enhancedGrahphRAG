  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Atropine is a muscarinic receptor antagonist that blocks the action of acetylcholine at muscarinic receptors. Option A involves nicotine, which primarily acts on nicotinic receptors, not muscarinic receptors, so atropine would not be effective. Option B involves neostigmine, which increases skeletal muscle strength by inhibiting acetylcholinesterase at the neuromuscular junction, primarily affecting nicotinic receptors, thus atropine would not block this effect. Option C, bradycardia caused by acetylcholine, directly involves muscarinic receptors in the heart, where atropine can effectively block the action of acetylcholine, preventing bradycardia.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opc\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}",
