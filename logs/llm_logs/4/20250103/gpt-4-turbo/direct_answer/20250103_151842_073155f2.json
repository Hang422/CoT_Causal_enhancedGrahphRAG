  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Aspirin is known to affect platelet function by irreversibly inhibiting the enzyme cyclooxygenase, which is crucial in the thromboxane pathway, leading to reduced platelet aggregation. Heparin, on the other hand, is an anticoagulant that works by enhancing the activity of antithrombin III, thus inhibiting thrombin and factor Xa, important factors in the clotting cascade. Combining aspirin with heparin increases the risk of bleeding due to their complementary effects on different aspects of blood coagulation and platelet function.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opa\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}",
