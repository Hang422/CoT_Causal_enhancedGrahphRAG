Hypoglycemia can lead to symptoms such as sweating and palpitations, which are consistent with the scenario described. Other options like cinchonism typically present with symptoms like tinnitus, headache, and visual disturbances. Hyperglycemia and hypokalemia do not commonly manifest with sweating and palpitations as primary symptoms in the context of quinine administration.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opc\",\n    \"confidence\": 90\n}",
