  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Fibrinolytic drugs, such as tissue plasminogen activator, are used in the treatment of acute myocardial infarction primarily to dissolve blood clots that are blocking the coronary arteries. The primary mechanism of action for these drugs is to convert plasminogen to plasmin, which then degrades fibrin clots. While effective in restoring blood flow, this mechanism also increases the risk of bleeding elsewhere in the body. Among the options provided, hemorrhagic stroke is a recognized and serious adverse effect of fibrinolytic therapy due to the systemic action of the drug leading to bleeding in the brain.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opd\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}",
