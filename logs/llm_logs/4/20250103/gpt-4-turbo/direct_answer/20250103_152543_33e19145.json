However, each enzyme listed is associated with different disorders: HGPRTase with Lesch-Nyhan syndrome, Adenosine deaminase with severe combined immunodeficiency, APRTase with adenine phosphoribosyltransferase deficiency, and Acid maltase with Pompe disease. Among these, Adenosine deaminase deficiency is a well-known cause of severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), a serious condition often identified in early childhood.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opb\",\n    \"confidence\": 75\n}",
