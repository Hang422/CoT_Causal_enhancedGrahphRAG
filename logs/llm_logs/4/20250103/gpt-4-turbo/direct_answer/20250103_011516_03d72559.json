  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Digoxin is a cardiac glycoside used primarily for treating heart failure and atrial fibrillation. It has a narrow therapeutic index, making it susceptible to significant drug interactions. Quinidine and thiazide diuretics are known to interact with digoxin; quinidine increases digoxin plasma levels, and thiazide diuretics can lead to hypokalemia, enhancing the effects of digoxin. Cholestyramine can bind to digoxin in the intestine, reducing its absorption. However, amlodipine, a calcium channel blocker, generally does not have a significant interaction with digoxin.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opd\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}",
