  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Warfarin-induced skin necrosis is a rare but severe complication associated with warfarin therapy. It typically occurs shortly after the initiation of treatment. The pathophysiology involves a rapid decrease in protein C levels, which is a natural anticoagulant, leading to a transient hypercoagulable state. This condition is more likely to occur in patients with pre-existing protein C deficiency, making them particularly susceptible to developing skin necrosis when exposed to warfarin.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opa\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}",
