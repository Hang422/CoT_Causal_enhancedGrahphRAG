  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Cholecystokinin (CCK) is a hormone that plays multiple roles in the digestive system. It is known to cause the contraction of the gall bladder, which helps in the release of bile. Additionally, CCK stimulates the secretion of pancreatic juice that is rich in digestive enzymes, aiding in the digestion of fats, proteins, and carbohydrates. However, there is no direct evidence linking CCK with the increased secretion of enterokinase, an enzyme involved in protein digestion. Therefore, the correct answer includes the actions of CCK that are well-supported by medical literature.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opd\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}",
