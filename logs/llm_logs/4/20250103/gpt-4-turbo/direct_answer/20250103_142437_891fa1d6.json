  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Dextromethorphan, commonly used as an antitussive in cough medications, can lead to hallucinations, especially at high doses. It acts on the central nervous system and can cause dissociative effects similar to those of ketamine and phencyclidine (PCP). The other options listed do not typically cause hallucinations as a primary side effect. Morphine, an opioid, primarily causes respiratory depression and euphoria. Diphenhydramine, an antihistamine, can cause sedation and sometimes delirium in high doses but is less likely to cause hallucinations. Aprepitant is used to prevent nausea and vomiting; it does not typically affect the central nervous system in a way that would lead to hallucinations.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opb\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}",
