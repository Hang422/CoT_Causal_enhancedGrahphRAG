  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Succinylcholine is known to cause a rapid increase in serum potassium levels due to its mechanism of action, which involves depolarizing the neuromuscular junction. In paraplegic patients, upregulation of extrajunctional acetylcholine receptors often occurs, making them more susceptible to this potassium efflux. The sudden rise in potassium can lead to hyperkalemia, which is a well-documented cause of dysrhythmias, conduction abnormalities, and cardiac arrest.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opb\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}",
