  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Amyloidosis of the spleen, known as splenic amyloidosis, typically does not cause severe anemia. Instead, it may lead to splenomegaly (enlargement of the spleen) and may contribute to an increased risk of bleeding or hypersplenism, which can sometimes cause mild anemia but not typically severe anemia. The other statements are generally accurate: amyloidosis associated with multiple myeloma does have a poor prognosis, fine-needle biopsy of subcutaneous abdominal fat is a reliable diagnostic method for secondary systemic amyloidosis, and hepatic amyloid disease often leads to hepatomegaly without significant jaundice.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opd\",\n    \"confidence\": 90\n}",
