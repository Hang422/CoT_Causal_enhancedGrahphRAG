  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"The fluidity of the plasma membrane is influenced by the types of fatty acids present in the phospholipids that make up the membrane. Unsaturated fatty acids, such as arachidonic acid, have one or more double bonds that create kinks in the fatty acid chains, preventing them from packing tightly together. This increases the fluidity of the membrane. In contrast, saturated fatty acids like palmitic acid and stearic acid have no double bonds, which allows them to pack closely together, decreasing membrane fluidity. Cholesterol also plays a role in modulating membrane fluidity but generally acts to stabilize the membrane and decrease its fluidity at higher temperatures.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opa\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}",
