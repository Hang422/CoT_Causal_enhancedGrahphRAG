  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"In myasthenia gravis, the use of certain drugs can exacerbate muscle weakness. Succinylcholine, a depolarizing neuromuscular blocker, can cause prolonged paralysis in patients with myasthenia gravis due to their altered acetylcholine receptor function. Pyridostigmine, on the other hand, is a medication used to treat myasthenia gravis by inhibiting acetylcholinesterase, thereby increasing the availability of acetylcholine at neuromuscular junctions. Tubocurare and Halothane do not have the same direct contraindications in myasthenia gravis as Succinylcholine.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opa\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}",
