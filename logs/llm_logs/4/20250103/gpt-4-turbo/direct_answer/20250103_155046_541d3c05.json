Among the listed drugs, Chloroquine, Betamethasone, and Zidovudine are known to potentially cause myopathy. Chloroquine can lead to myopathy or neuropathy with long-term use. Betamethasone, a corticosteroid, can cause steroid-induced myopathy. Zidovudine, an antiretroviral drug, is associated with myopathy, particularly mitochondrial myopathy. Chloramphenicol, an antibiotic, does not typically cause myopathy, making it the correct choice.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opc\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}",
