  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Cyclic AMP (cAMP) primarily functions by activating protein kinase A (PKA). When cAMP levels increase, it binds to the regulatory subunits of PKA, causing a conformational change that releases the catalytic subunits. These catalytic subunits then phosphorylate various target proteins, altering their function. While cAMP is involved in the activation of adenylate cyclase, it is more of a product of adenylate cyclase rather than an activator. cAMP does not directly cause Ca2+ release; this is generally mediated by other pathways such as those involving IP3.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opa\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}",
