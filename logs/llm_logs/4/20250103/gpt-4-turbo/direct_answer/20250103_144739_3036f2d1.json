  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"L-Dopa is combined with carbidopa in the treatment of parkinsonism primarily to inhibit the conversion of levodopa to dopamine in the peripheral tissues. This inhibition is crucial because it prevents the premature conversion of levodopa before it reaches the brain, where it is needed to exert its effects. By preventing this peripheral conversion, carbidopa allows more levodopa to reach the brain and reduces the required dose of levodopa, thereby also reducing side effects associated with higher doses of levodopa alone.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opd\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}",
