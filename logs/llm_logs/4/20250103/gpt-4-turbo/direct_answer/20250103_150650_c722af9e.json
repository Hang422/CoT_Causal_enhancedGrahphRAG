  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Heparin is a highly sulfated glycosaminoglycan and is indeed a strong acid, not the weakest. It is primarily sourced from pig intestinal mucosa for commercial preparations. Heparin functions by activating antithrombin, which then inhibits thrombin and factor Xa, crucial steps in the coagulation cascade. One of the known side effects of heparin is heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), where the platelet count can significantly decrease. Therefore, the statement about being the weakest acid is incorrect.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opa\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}",
