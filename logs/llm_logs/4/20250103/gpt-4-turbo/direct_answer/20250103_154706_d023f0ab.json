  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Cholesterol is transported from the liver to peripheral tissues primarily by Low-Density Lipoproteins (LDL). LDL is known for its role in carrying cholesterol released by the liver into the bloodstream to various tissues throughout the body. VLDL initially transports triglycerides and is converted into LDL, which then carries cholesterol. HDL, on the other hand, is involved in reverse cholesterol transport, moving cholesterol away from tissues back to the liver. Chylomicrons primarily transport dietary lipids from the intestines to other locations in the body.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opb\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}",
