  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Fluconazole is a triazole antifungal medication used to treat and prevent superficial and systemic fungal infections. It works by inhibiting the fungal cytochrome P450 enzyme 14Î±-demethylase. This enzyme is involved in the conversion of lanosterol to ergosterol, which is a vital component of the fungal cell membrane. Therefore, fluconazole's action inhibits the demethylation of lanosterol, disrupting cell membrane formation and resulting in fungal cell death. Regarding the other options: Fluconazole is not highly effective against aspergillosis, it does penetrate the blood-brain barrier well, and it has high oral bioavailability, generally higher than that of ketoconazole.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opd\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}",
