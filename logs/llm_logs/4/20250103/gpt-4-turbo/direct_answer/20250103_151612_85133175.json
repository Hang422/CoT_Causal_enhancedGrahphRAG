  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Hyperprolactinemia is a condition characterized by an elevated level of the hormone prolactin in the blood. Metoclopramide, an antiemetic and gastroprokinetic agent, is known to increase prolactin levels as a side effect due to its antagonistic effects on dopamine receptors, which inhibits dopamine's action of suppressing prolactin release. Bromocriptine, on the other hand, is a dopamine agonist used to treat hyperprolactinemia by lowering prolactin levels. Levodopa and Amantadine, used in Parkinson's disease, do not typically cause hyperprolactinemia as a side effect.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opd\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}",
