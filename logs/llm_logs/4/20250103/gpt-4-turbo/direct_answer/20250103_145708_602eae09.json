  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Cisapride is known to prolong the QT interval on an electrocardiogram, which can lead to torsades de pointes, a type of ventricular tachycardia. Erythromycin, an antibiotic the patient is taking, also has the potential to prolong the QT interval. The combination of erythromycin and cisapride can significantly increase the risk of developing torsades de pointes due to additive effects on QT prolongation. The other medications listed (Famotidine, Lansoprazole, and Metoclopramide) are less likely to cause QT prolongation compared to Cisapride.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opa\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}",
