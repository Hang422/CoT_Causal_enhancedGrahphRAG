  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Adrenal insufficiency, such as Addison's disease, typically leads to decreased cortisol and aldosterone production. This results in hyponatremia (low sodium), hyperkalemia (high potassium), and hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) due to the lack of these hormones' effects on sodium retention, potassium excretion, and glucose metabolism, respectively. Metabolic alkalosis, characterized by an increase in blood pH, is not typically associated with adrenal insufficiency. Instead, adrenal insufficiency more commonly leads to metabolic acidosis due to the reduced excretion of hydrogen ions.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opd\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}",
