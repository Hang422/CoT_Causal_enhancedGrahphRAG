  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"The HMP shunt, also known as the pentose phosphate pathway, is present in all cells that require NADPH and ribose-5-phosphate, including liver, adipose tissue, and brain. Red blood cells (RBCs), however, rely heavily on this pathway for the production of NADPH, which is crucial for maintaining the integrity of their cell membranes by keeping glutathione in a reduced state. Therefore, all listed organs except adipose tissue heavily depend on the HMP shunt for critical functions.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opb\",\n    \"confidence\": 85\n}",
