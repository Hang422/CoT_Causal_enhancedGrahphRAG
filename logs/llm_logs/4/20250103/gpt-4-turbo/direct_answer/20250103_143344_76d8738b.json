Albumin acts as a carrier for these fatty acids to various tissues including the liver, where they can undergo oxidation in the mitochondria. Chylomicrons are involved in the transport of dietary lipids from the intestines to other parts of the body, but not typically in the transport of free fatty acids for mitochondrial oxidation.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opb\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}",
