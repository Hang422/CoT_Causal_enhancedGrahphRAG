Among the options provided, Busulfan is well-documented to cause pulmonary fibrosis, particularly in long-term use or high doses. Methotrexate can cause lung toxicity, but it is more commonly associated with pneumonitis rather than fibrosis. Doxorubicin and Cisplatin are primarily linked to other forms of toxicity, such as cardiotoxicity and nephrotoxicity respectively, rather than pulmonary fibrosis.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opd\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}",
