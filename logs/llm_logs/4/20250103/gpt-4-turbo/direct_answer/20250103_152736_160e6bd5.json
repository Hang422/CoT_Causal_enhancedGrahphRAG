  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"ADH (Antidiuretic Hormone), also known as vasopressin, is primarily secreted in response to low blood volume (hypovolemia) or high blood osmolarity. Hypervolemia and decreased osmolarity typically lead to decreased ADH secretion. Hypertension's effect on ADH can vary depending on the underlying cause, but it is not directly associated with a primary increase in ADH secretion. Therefore, hypovolemia is the condition among the options provided that most directly results in an increase in ADH secretion.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opc\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}",
