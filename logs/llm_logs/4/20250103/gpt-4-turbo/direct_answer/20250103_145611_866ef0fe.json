  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Insulin resistance in diabetic patients can indeed be exacerbated by infections or the presence of antibodies to insulin. However, the use of glucocorticoids typically increases insulin resistance and is not generally recommended to manage insulin resistance in diabetic patients. The statement about huminsulin causing more common insulin resistance is not supported by evidence, as huminsulin is simply human insulin and does not inherently cause more insulin resistance compared to other forms of insulin.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opd\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}",
