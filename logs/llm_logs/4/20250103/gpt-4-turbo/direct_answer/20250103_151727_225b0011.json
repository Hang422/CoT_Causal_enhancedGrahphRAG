  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Triamterene is a potassium-sparing diuretic that is used to prevent hypokalemia (low levels of potassium in the blood) which can be a side effect of other diuretics. It works by making the kidneys eliminate sodium (salt) and water from the body while retaining potassium. Therefore, it does not cause hypokalemia but rather helps in preventing it. Muscle cramps can be a side effect of triamterene, typically resulting from its effects on electrolyte balance.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opb\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}",
