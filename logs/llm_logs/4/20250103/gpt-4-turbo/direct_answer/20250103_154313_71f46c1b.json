  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Isoniazid, a medication used to treat tuberculosis, is known to cause a deficiency in Vitamin B6 (pyridoxine). This occurs because isoniazid competes with pyridoxine for binding to the enzyme pyridoxine kinase, which is crucial for the activation of vitamin B6. The deficiency can lead to peripheral neuropathy among other symptoms, which is why pyridoxine supplementation is often recommended during treatment with isoniazid.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opc\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}",
