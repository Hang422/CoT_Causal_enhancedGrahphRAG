  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Alpha-1 adrenergic blockers are commonly used to provide symptomatic relief in benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) by relaxing the smooth muscles in the prostate and bladder neck, thereby improving urine flow. Tamsulosin is specifically indicated for this purpose and is well-known for its selectivity towards alpha-1A receptors, which are primarily found in the prostate. This selectivity makes it effective in treating BPH with a lower risk of causing hypotension, a common side effect of non-selective alpha blockers like Prazosin. Oxazocin and Dolazoline are not recognized as standard treatments for BPH in medical literature.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opa\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}",
