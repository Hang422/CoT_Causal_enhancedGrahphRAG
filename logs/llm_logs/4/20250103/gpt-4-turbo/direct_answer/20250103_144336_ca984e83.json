  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Levamisole is primarily used as an anthelmintic agent and an immunomodulator. It acts by causing paralysis of worms through depolarization and is also known to stimulate the immune system. While it can act as an immunostimulant, there is no evidence to suggest that it acts as an immunodepressant at high doses. Instead, high doses can lead to side effects such as agranulocytosis and leukopenia, which are harmful but do not classify it as an immunodepressant.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opd\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}",
