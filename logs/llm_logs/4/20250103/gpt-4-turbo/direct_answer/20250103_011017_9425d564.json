  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Renin, Angiotensin I, and Erythropoietin are all peptides associated with the renal system. Renin is produced by the kidneys and is involved in the regulation of blood pressure. Angiotensin I is a precursor molecule formed by the action of renin on angiotensinogen. Erythropoietin, also produced by the kidneys, stimulates red blood cell production. However, 1,25-Dihydroxycholecalciferol (1,25DHCC), also known as calcitriol, is the active form of vitamin D, primarily synthesized in the kidneys but not a peptide; it is a secosteroid hormone.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opd\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}",
