  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Aldosterone is the most potent mineralocorticoid among the options listed. It plays a crucial role in regulating sodium and potassium levels in the body, which significantly affects blood pressure and fluid balance. DOCA (Deoxycorticosterone acetate) and Fludrocortisone also have mineralocorticoid activity, with Fludrocortisone being used clinically due to its potent mineralocorticoid properties. However, Aldosterone is naturally the most potent mineralocorticoid produced by the adrenal cortex. Triamcinolone, on the other hand, is primarily a glucocorticoid with negligible mineralocorticoid effects.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opa\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}",
