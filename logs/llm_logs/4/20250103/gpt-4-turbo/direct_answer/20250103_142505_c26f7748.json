  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Myoclonus refers to sudden, brief involuntary twitching or jerking of a muscle or group of muscles. It's described as an abnormal, uncontrolled muscle twitch. Among the options provided, Clonazepam and Sodium Valproate are both effective treatments for myoclonus. Clonazepam, a benzodiazepine, is often used for its efficacy in treating various types of myoclonic jerks and seizures. Sodium Valproate is also widely used and effective in treating myoclonus and other seizure disorders. Phenobarbitone and Ethosuximide are less commonly used for myoclonus, with Ethosuximide primarily targeting absence seizures and not typically used for myoclonus. Based on clinical effectiveness and broader usage in treating myoclonus specifically, Clonazepam is often preferred.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opa\",\n    \"confidence\": 85\n}",
