  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Gp2b3A inhibitors, also known as glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors, are a class of medications that prevent platelet aggregation and thrombus formation by blocking the glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor on the surface of platelets. Abciximab, Eptifibatide, and Tirofiban are all examples of Gp2b3A inhibitors. Prasugrel, on the other hand, is not a Gp2b3A inhibitor; it is a thienopyridine class antiplatelet agent that inhibits platelet activation and aggregation by irreversibly binding to P2Y12 ADP receptors on platelets. Therefore, Prasugrel does not fit the category of Gp2b3A inhibitors.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opd\",\n    \"confidence\": 100\n}",
