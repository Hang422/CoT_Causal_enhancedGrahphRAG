Krabbe's disease is a lysosomal storage disorder, not a glycogen storage disease. Fabry's disease is also a lysosomal storage disorder characterized by the buildup of globotriaosylceramide, not glycogen. Fragile X syndrome is a genetic disorder related to the FMR1 gene affecting the X chromosome, and it does not involve glycogen storage. Therefore, all the options listed are not glycogen storage diseases.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opd\",\n    \"confidence\": 100\n}",
