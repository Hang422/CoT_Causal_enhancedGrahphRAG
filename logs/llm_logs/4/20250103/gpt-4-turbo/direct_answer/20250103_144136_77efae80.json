  "response": "```json\n{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"The symptoms described in the question, including aggressive behavior, self-mutilation, joint pain, and reduced urinary output, suggest a disorder related to purine metabolism. Adenosine Deaminase (ADA) deficiency is known to cause severe combined immunodeficiency, but it does not typically present with the symptoms described. However, a deficiency in Hypoxanthine-Guanine Phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRT), which is not directly listed but implied in the options as 'HGPase', leads to Lesch-Nyhan syndrome. Lesch-Nyhan syndrome is characterized by neurological dysfunction, behavioral disturbances including self-mutilation, and issues related to uric acid metabolism such as gouty arthritis and kidney problems.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opa\",\n    \"confidence\": 90\n}\n```",
