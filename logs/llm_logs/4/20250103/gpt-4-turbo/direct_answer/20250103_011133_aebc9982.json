Morphine metabolites, such as morphine-6-glucuronide, can accumulate in patients with renal impairment, potentially leading to increased toxicity, including respiratory depression and prolonged sedation. Pethidine, Fentanyl, and Atracurium do not have the same degree of risk regarding metabolite accumulation and toxicity in renal failure as Morphine does.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opb\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}",
