  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Enzymatic markers of the plasma membrane are typically enzymes that are either embedded in or associated with the membrane, playing roles in signal transduction, ion transport, or other cellular processes. 5'-nucleotidase, adenylyl cyclase, and Na+-K+-ATPase are all enzymes known to be associated with the plasma membrane. 5'-nucleotidase is involved in purine metabolism and is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored protein on the outer layer of the plasma membrane. Adenylyl cyclase, which converts ATP to cyclic AMP in response to extracellular signals, is an integral membrane protein. Na+-K+-ATPase, crucial for maintaining cellular volume and the electrochemical gradient, is a well-known membrane-bound enzyme. In contrast, Galactosyl transferase, primarily involved in the synthesis of glycoproteins in the Golgi apparatus, is not typically a marker of the plasma membrane.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opd\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}",
