  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Under normal conditions, the primary source of energy for cardiac muscle is fatty acids. Cardiac muscle cells are highly oxidative and rely predominantly on aerobic metabolism. They can utilize various substrates for energy, including fatty acids, glucose, and ketone bodies. However, fatty acids are the preferred source, providing about 60-70% of the ATP generated. Glucose and ketone bodies are also used, but to a lesser extent, unless under specific conditions such as fasting or diabetes.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opa\",\n    \"confidence\": 90\n}",
