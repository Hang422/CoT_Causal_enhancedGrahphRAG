  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Epinephrine, when administered intravenously at high doses, primarily acts as a potent stimulator of both alpha and beta-adrenergic receptors. This leads to increased liver glycogenolysis (opa), potential cardiac arrhythmias such as extrasystoles (opc), and central nervous system effects like restlessness and anxiety (opd). However, epinephrine typically causes bronchodilation, not bronchoconstriction, due to its action on beta-2 adrenergic receptors in the bronchial smooth muscle.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opb\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}",
