  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Uricosuric drugs are medications that increase the excretion of uric acid in the urine, thus lowering the levels of uric acid in the blood. Probenecid is a well-known uricosuric drug used primarily to treat gout and hyperuricemia by inhibiting the reabsorption of uric acid at the renal tubules. Allopurinol, on the other hand, works by reducing the production of uric acid, not by increasing its excretion. Indomethacin and Aspirin are anti-inflammatory drugs and do not primarily affect uric acid excretion.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opb\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}",
