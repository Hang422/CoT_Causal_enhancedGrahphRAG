  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Secretin, a hormone released by the duodenum, primarily functions to regulate the pH of the duodenal contents by stimulating the pancreas to release bicarbonate-rich fluids. This action helps neutralize the acidic chyme received from the stomach, thereby protecting the intestinal mucosa and aiding in digestion. While Secretin also has effects on gastric secretion and the gastrointestinal motility, its principal and most direct action is the stimulation of bicarbonate secretion from the pancreas.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opb\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}",
