  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Sertoli cells, located in the seminiferous tubules of the testes, are primarily responsible for nurturing the developing sperm cells through the process of spermatogenesis. One of the key substances they secrete is the Androgen Binding Protein (ABP), which binds to testosterone, increasing its concentration in the seminiferous tubules and thereby facilitating spermatogenesis. Testosterone itself is produced by the Leydig cells, not Sertoli cells. Luteinizing Hormone (LH) and Follicle-Stimulating Hormone (FSH) are secreted by the anterior pituitary gland, not by the Sertoli cells.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opa\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}",
