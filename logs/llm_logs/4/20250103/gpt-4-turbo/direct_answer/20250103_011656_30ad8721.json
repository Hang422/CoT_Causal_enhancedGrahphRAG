It works by stimulating the immune system to fight the virus. Podophylline is also used for genital warts but is not an immunomodulator. Interferon can be used as an immunotherapy but is less commonly used topically for genital warts. Acyclovir is an antiviral medication used primarily for herpes simplex virus infections and not for HPV.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opa\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}",
