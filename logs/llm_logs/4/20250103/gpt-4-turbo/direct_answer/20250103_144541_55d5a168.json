  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"The plasma membrane of a cell is connected to the cytoskeleton through various proteins that help maintain cell structure and integrity. Ankyrin is a key protein that links the integral membrane proteins to the underlying spectrin-actin cytoskeleton, thereby stabilizing the cell structure and contributing to the cell's mechanical properties. While spectrin is also part of the cytoskeletal structure, it does not directly bind the plasma membrane to the cytoskeleton but rather is connected through ankyrin. Tubulin forms microtubules and laminin is involved in the extracellular matrix, not in linking the plasma membrane to the cytoskeleton.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opb\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}",
