  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Propylthiouracil is generally preferred over methimazole in the first trimester of pregnancy due to a lower risk of congenital malformations associated with its use during this period. Methimazole is associated with a higher risk of congenital defects, especially when used during early pregnancy. Carbimazole is metabolized to methimazole and thus carries similar risks. Perchlorate is not commonly used for managing hyperthyroidism in pregnancy due to its different mechanism and less favorable safety profile.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opb\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}",
