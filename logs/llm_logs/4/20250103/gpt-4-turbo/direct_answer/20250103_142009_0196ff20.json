The 'coasting effect' refers to the phenomenon where symptoms of neurotoxicity worsen or appear after cessation of chemotherapy, which can be seen with drugs like cisplatin. However, pulmonary fibrosis (scarring of the lungs) is not a typical side effect associated with cisplatin; it is more commonly linked to other drugs such as bleomycin.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opd\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}",
