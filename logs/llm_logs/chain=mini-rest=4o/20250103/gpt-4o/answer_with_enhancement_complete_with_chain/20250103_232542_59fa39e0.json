Thiothixanthene\nopb. Phenothiazine\nopc. Butyrophenone\nopd. Diphenyl butyl piperidine\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nPimozide is an antipsychotic medication primarily used to treat Tourette syndrome and functions as a dopamine receptor antagonist. It is classified under the diphenyl butyl piperidine class of antipsychotic agents, not as a butyrophenone. The retrieved evidence paths confirm its use in treating Tourette syndrome and its interaction with antipsychotic agents and dopamine antagonists, supporting its classification as a diphenyl butyl piperidine. Therefore, the correct classification for Pimozide is diphenyl butyl piperidine.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Pimozide is an antipsychotic medication that is primarily used to treat Tourette syndrome. It functions as a dopamine receptor antagonist. The classification of antipsychotic drugs is based on their chemical structure, and Pimozide is classified under the diphenyl butyl piperidine class. This classification is supported by standard pharmacological references and aligns with the enhanced information provided. The other options, such as thiothixanthene, phenothiazine, and butyrophenone, represent different classes of antipsychotic drugs with distinct chemical structures. Therefore, based on the consensus in pharmacology, the most likely correct classification for Pimozide is diphenyl butyl piperidine.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
