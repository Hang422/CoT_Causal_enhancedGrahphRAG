Increases liver glycogenolysis\nopb. Causes broachiolar constriction\nopc. Evokes extrasystoles in the heart\nopd. Produces restlessness and anxiety\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nEpinephrine, when administered intravenously in high doses, primarily acts on adrenergic receptors. It stimulates beta-adrenergic receptors, leading to increased heart rate and contractility, which can evoke extrasystoles in the heart. This aligns with the evidence path showing epinephrine's interaction with beta-adrenergic receptors. It also stimulates alpha-adrenergic receptors, increasing liver glycogenolysis, which is consistent with standard pharmacological knowledge. Epinephrine typically causes bronchodilation by stimulating beta-2 adrenergic receptors, contradicting the notion of bronchiolar constriction. This is supported by the evidence path indicating interaction with beta-adrenergic receptors. Additionally, epinephrine can activate the central nervous system, producing restlessness and anxiety. The evidence paths confirm epinephrine's interaction with adrenergic receptors, supporting its known actions. Therefore, the action not associated with high-dose intravenous epinephrine is bronchiolar constriction.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "
