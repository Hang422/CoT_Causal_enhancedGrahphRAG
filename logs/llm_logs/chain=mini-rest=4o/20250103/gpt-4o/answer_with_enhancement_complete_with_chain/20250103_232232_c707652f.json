Chlorothiazide\nopb. Beta blockers\nopc. ACE inhibitors\nopd. Amlodipine\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nSpironolactone is a potassium-sparing diuretic that increases potassium levels, posing a risk of hyperkalemia. ACE inhibitors, like spironolactone, can also increase potassium levels, making their concurrent use potentially contraindicated due to the increased risk of hyperkalemia. Chlorothiazide, a thiazide diuretic, typically decreases potassium levels and is not contraindicated with spironolactone. Beta blockers do not significantly affect potassium levels and are generally not contraindicated. Amlodipine, a calcium channel blocker, does not affect potassium levels and is not contraindicated with spironolactone. Therefore, the most consensus-aligned contraindication is with ACE inhibitors due to the risk of hyperkalemia.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Spironolactone is a potassium-sparing diuretic that can lead to increased potassium levels in the blood, posing a risk of hyperkalemia. ACE inhibitors also have the potential to increase potassium levels. When used together, the risk of hyperkalemia is significantly heightened, making the concurrent use of spironolactone and ACE inhibitors potentially contraindicated. Chlorothiazide, a thiazide diuretic, typically decreases potassium levels and is not contraindicated with spironolactone. Beta blockers and amlodipine do not significantly affect potassium levels and are generally not contraindicated with spironolactone. Therefore, based on the risk of hyperkalemia, the most likely contraindicated drug with spironolactone is an ACE inhibitor.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opc\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
