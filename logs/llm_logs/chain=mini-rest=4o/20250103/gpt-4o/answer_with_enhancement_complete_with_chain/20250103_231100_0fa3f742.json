Thiamine\nopb. Pyridoxine\nopc. Niacin\nopd. Riboflavin\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nINH (isoniazid) induced neuropathy is primarily associated with vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) deficiency. Isoniazid can lead to peripheral neuropathy by depleting vitamin B6, which is crucial for nerve function. Pyridoxine supplementation is recommended and effective in treating this condition by correcting the deficiency and improving neuropathy symptoms. The retrieved evidence paths support this consensus, indicating that pyridoxine treats neuropathy and is associated with vitamin B6 deficiency, which aligns with the standard medical understanding. Other options like thiamine, niacin, and riboflavin are not relevant to treating INH-induced neuropathy.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"INH (isoniazid) is known to cause peripheral neuropathy due to its interference with vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) metabolism. This is a well-established fact in pharmacology. The neuropathy occurs because isoniazid forms a complex with pyridoxine, leading to a functional deficiency of this vitamin, which is essential for nerve health. The standard treatment for INH-induced neuropathy is supplementation with pyridoxine, which replenishes the depleted vitamin B6 levels and alleviates the symptoms of neuropathy. The enhanced information provided aligns with this consensus, confirming that pyridoxine is the appropriate treatment. Other vitamins listed, such as thiamine, niacin, and riboflavin, do not have a direct role in treating INH-induced neuropathy.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 100\n}\n```",
