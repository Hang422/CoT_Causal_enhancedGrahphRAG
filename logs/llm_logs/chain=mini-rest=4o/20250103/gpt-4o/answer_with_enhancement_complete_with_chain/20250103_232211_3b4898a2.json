Meningitis\nopb. Pericarditis\nopc. Ileo-caecal tuberculosis\nopd. Adrenal involvement\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nIn tuberculosis, steroids are indicated for certain forms to reduce inflammation and improve outcomes. For meningitis, steroids are used to reduce inflammation and improve neurological outcomes, aligning with consensus. In pericarditis, steroids help reduce pericardial inflammation and decrease cardiac complications, supported by evidence paths showing steroids' interaction with inflammation-related genes. For adrenal involvement, steroids are indicated to address adrenal insufficiency and restore hormonal balance. However, in ileo-caecal tuberculosis, steroids are not typically indicated due to the risk of exacerbating the infection, which aligns with standard medical consensus. Therefore, the exception where steroids are not indicated is ileo-caecal tuberculosis.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"In tuberculosis, steroids are used to manage inflammation and improve outcomes in specific cases. For tuberculous meningitis, steroids are indicated to reduce inflammation and improve neurological outcomes. In tuberculous pericarditis, they help reduce pericardial inflammation and prevent complications. In cases of adrenal involvement, steroids are necessary to address adrenal insufficiency. However, in ileo-caecal tuberculosis, the use of steroids is not typically recommended as they can exacerbate the infection by suppressing the immune response. This aligns with standard medical consensus, making ileo-caecal tuberculosis the exception where steroids are not indicated.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opc\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
