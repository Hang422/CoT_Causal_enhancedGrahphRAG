Collecting duct\nopb. Glomerulus\nopc. Proximal convoluted tubule\nopd. Loop of Henle\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nAldosterone is a hormone secreted by the adrenal glands that primarily acts on the renal tubules of the kidneys, specifically targeting the collecting duct. Its main function is to regulate sodium and potassium levels by promoting sodium reabsorption and increasing water retention, which influences fluid and electrolyte balance. The retrieved evidence paths, while broad, support the role of aldosterone in affecting renal tubule structure and function, aligning with the consensus that its primary site of action is the collecting duct. Other nephron segments like the glomerulus, proximal convoluted tubule, and loop of Henle are not the main targets of aldosterone's action.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "
