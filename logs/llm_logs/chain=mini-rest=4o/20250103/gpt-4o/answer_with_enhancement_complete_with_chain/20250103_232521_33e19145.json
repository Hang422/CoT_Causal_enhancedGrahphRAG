HGPRTase\nopb. Adenosine deaminase\nopc. APRTase\nopd. Acid maltase\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nIn evaluating the potential enzyme deficiency in the child, we consider the following: 1) Lesch-Nyhan syndrome is characterized by a deficiency in HGPRTase, leading to uric acid accumulation, gout, and neurological symptoms. This aligns with the consensus understanding of the condition. 2) Severe combined immunodeficiency is associated with adenosine deaminase deficiency, resulting in toxic metabolite accumulation and impaired lymphocyte function, which is well-supported by medical consensus. 3) APRTase deficiency can lead to kidney stones and hyperuricemia due to increased uric acid levels, but this is less commonly associated with the described symptoms. 4) Acid maltase deficiency, known as Pompe disease, results in glycogen accumulation in lysosomes, causing muscle weakness and cardiomyopathy. The evidence paths related to adenosine deaminase and acid maltase support these associations. Based on the symptoms described, the most likely enzyme deficiency is HGPRTase, consistent with Lesch-Nyhan syndrome.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"To determine the enzyme deficiency in the child, we need to consider the symptoms typically associated with each enzyme deficiency. Lesch-Nyhan syndrome, characterized by neurological symptoms, self-mutilation, and hyperuricemia, is caused by a deficiency in HGPRTase. Adenosine deaminase deficiency leads to severe combined immunodeficiency, which presents with recurrent infections and failure to thrive. APRTase deficiency is less commonly associated with neurological symptoms and more with kidney stones. Acid maltase deficiency, or Pompe disease, results in muscle weakness and cardiomyopathy, not typically neurological symptoms. Given the context provided, the symptoms align most closely with Lesch-Nyhan syndrome, suggesting a deficiency in HGPRTase. This is supported by the consensus understanding of the condition.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}",
