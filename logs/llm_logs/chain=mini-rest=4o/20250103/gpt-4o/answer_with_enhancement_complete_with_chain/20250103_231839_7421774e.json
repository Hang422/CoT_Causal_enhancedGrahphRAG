You would be concerned about the use of this drug if the patient also had what comorbid condition\n\n                    ### Options\n                    opa. Glaucoma\nopb. Essential tremor\nopc. Diabetes\nopd. Supraventricular tachycardia\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nPropranolol is a non-selective beta-blocker used prophylactically after myocardial infarction. It can mask symptoms of hypoglycemia, which is a concern for patients with diabetes, as it may lead to unrecognized low blood sugar levels. This aligns with the retrieved evidence path linking diabetes to hypoglycemia. Propranolol can also cause bronchoconstriction, posing a risk for patients with asthma, but this is not directly relevant to the options provided. In patients with supraventricular tachycardia, propranolol may lower heart rate excessively, potentially worsening bradycardia, but it is often used to manage this condition. Propranolol is not contraindicated in glaucoma and can be used cautiously. Therefore, the most concerning comorbid condition when using propranolol is diabetes due to the risk of masking hypoglycemia.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "
