Pirenzepine\nopb. Loratadine\nopc. Misoprostol\nopd. Esomeprazole\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nThe drug of choice for peptic ulcer disease caused by chronic NSAID use is Misoprostol. Chronic NSAID use leads to inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis, resulting in reduced mucosal protection and increased risk of peptic ulcer disease. Misoprostol, a prostaglandin analog, is effective in providing mucosal protection and preventing NSAID-induced ulcers. The retrieved evidence supports the association of Misoprostol with peptic ulcer management, confirming its role as a pharmaceutical preparation beneficial in this context. Other options, such as Pirenzepine, Loratadine, and Esomeprazole, do not align with the consensus for this specific indication.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Peptic ulcer disease caused by chronic NSAID use is primarily due to the inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis, which reduces mucosal protection in the gastrointestinal tract. Misoprostol, a prostaglandin E1 analog, is specifically used to counteract this effect by providing mucosal protection and preventing NSAID-induced ulcers. While proton pump inhibitors like Esomeprazole can also be used to reduce gastric acid secretion and promote ulcer healing, Misoprostol is particularly indicated for its protective role against NSAID-induced mucosal damage. The enhanced information aligns with standard medical knowledge, confirming Misoprostol as the drug of choice in this scenario.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opc\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
