Contraction of gall bladder\nopb. Secretion of pancreatic juice rich in enzymes\nopc. Increases the secretion of enterokinase\nopd. All\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nCholecystokinin (CCK) is a hormone known to have several physiological actions. It stimulates the contraction of the gallbladder, leading to the release of bile into the intestine, which aids in fat digestion. This aligns with the consensus and is supported by the evidence path showing CCK's interaction with cells involved in these processes. CCK also stimulates pancreatic acinar cells to secrete pancreatic juice rich in enzymes, enhancing the digestion of nutrients, which is consistent with the consensus and supported by the evidence path showing CCK's interaction with acinar cells. However, the claim that CCK increases the secretion of enterokinase is not supported by standard consensus; enterokinase is primarily secreted by the intestinal mucosa and not directly influenced by CCK. Therefore, the correct actions of CCK include gallbladder contraction and the secretion of enzyme-rich pancreatic juice, but not the increase in enterokinase secretion. Thus, the correct answer is that CCK's actions include both gallbladder contraction and secretion of pancreatic juice rich in enzymes, but not all the actions listed.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "
