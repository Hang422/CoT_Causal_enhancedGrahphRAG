PAS\nopb. Ethionamide\nopc. Cycloserine\nopd. Pyrazinamide\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nEthionamide is known to inhibit thyroid hormone synthesis, leading to decreased levels of T3 and T4, which can cause hypothyroidism. This aligns with the consensus that ethionamide can induce hypothyroidism. PAS (p-Aminosalicylic Acid) has been suggested to interfere with thyroid function, but the evidence is less direct and not as strongly supported by consensus, making it a less likely cause of hypothyroidism. Cycloserine and Pyrazinamide do not have established links to hypothyroidism, as they do not directly affect thyroid hormone synthesis or function. Therefore, ethionamide is the most likely anti-tubercular drug to cause hypothyroidism based on current medical consensus.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The question asks which anti-tubercular drug is known to cause hypothyroidism. Among the options provided, ethionamide is recognized in medical literature for its potential to inhibit thyroid hormone synthesis, leading to decreased levels of T3 and T4, and thus causing hypothyroidism. This aligns with the consensus that ethionamide can induce hypothyroidism. While PAS has been suggested to interfere with thyroid function, the evidence is not as strong or direct as it is for ethionamide. Cycloserine and Pyrazinamide do not have established links to hypothyroidism. Therefore, based on the current medical consensus, ethionamide is the most likely anti-tubercular drug to cause hypothyroidism.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}\n```",
