Hyoscine\nopb. Metoclopramide\nopc. Prochlorperazine\nopd. Ondansetron\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nHyoscine, also known as scopolamine, is an anticholinergic agent that is well-established in the prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with motion sickness, making it the drug of choice for motion sickness prophylaxis. The evidence path confirms its interaction with anticholinergic agents, supporting its use in this context. Metoclopramide, a dopamine antagonist, primarily increases gastric motility and is not typically used for motion sickness. Prochlorperazine, an antipsychotic with antiemetic effects, is used for general nausea and vomiting but is not a first-line treatment for motion sickness. Ondansetron, a serotonin receptor antagonist, is effective for chemotherapy-induced nausea but not typically used for motion sickness. Therefore, Hyoscine is the most appropriate option for motion sickness prophylaxis.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The primary medical principle in determining the prophylaxis of motion sickness is the use of anticholinergic agents, which are effective in preventing nausea and vomiting associated with this condition. Hyoscine, also known as scopolamine, is a well-established anticholinergic agent specifically used for this purpose. It works by blocking the action of acetylcholine in the brain, which helps to prevent the symptoms of motion sickness. The other options, such as Metoclopramide, Prochlorperazine, and Ondansetron, are not typically used for motion sickness prophylaxis. Metoclopramide is more focused on increasing gastric motility, Prochlorperazine is used for general nausea and vomiting, and Ondansetron is primarily used for chemotherapy-induced nausea. Therefore, based on standard medical knowledge and consensus, Hyoscine is the most appropriate choice for the prophylaxis of motion sickness.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
