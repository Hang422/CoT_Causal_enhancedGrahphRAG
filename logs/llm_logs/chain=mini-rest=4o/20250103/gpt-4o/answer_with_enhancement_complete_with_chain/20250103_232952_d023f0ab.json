HDL\nopb. LDL\nopc. VLDL\nopd. Chylomicrons\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nCholesterol is synthesized in the liver and needs to be transported to peripheral tissues. The primary carrier of cholesterol in the bloodstream is Low-Density Lipoprotein (LDL), which delivers cholesterol to peripheral tissues. LDL is formed from Very Low-Density Lipoprotein (VLDL) after the removal of triglycerides. While VLDL primarily carries triglycerides, it is converted to LDL, which is responsible for cholesterol delivery. High-Density Lipoprotein (HDL) primarily functions to remove excess cholesterol from tissues and transport it back to the liver, not to deliver cholesterol to peripheral tissues. Chylomicrons are involved in the transport of dietary lipids, not liver-derived cholesterol. The evidence paths confirm the interaction of LDL with cells and its role in cholesterol transport, supporting the consensus that LDL is the main transporter of cholesterol from the liver to peripheral tissues.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The transport of cholesterol from the liver to peripheral tissues is primarily carried out by Low-Density Lipoprotein (LDL). Cholesterol is synthesized in the liver and initially transported in the form of Very Low-Density Lipoprotein (VLDL), which primarily carries triglycerides. As VLDL loses triglycerides, it is converted into LDL, which is the main carrier of cholesterol to peripheral tissues. High-Density Lipoprotein (HDL) is mainly involved in reverse cholesterol transport, bringing cholesterol back to the liver, while chylomicrons are responsible for transporting dietary lipids, not liver-derived cholesterol. Therefore, based on standard medical knowledge and the enhanced information provided, LDL is the primary transporter of cholesterol from the liver to peripheral tissues.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
