Methimazole\nopb. Propylthiouraril\nopc. Carbimazole\nopd. Perchlorate\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nIn the treatment of hyperthyroidism during the first trimester of pregnancy, Propylthiouracil (PTU) is the preferred drug due to its better safety profile compared to Methimazole and Carbimazole. Methimazole is associated with teratogenic effects, particularly in the first trimester, and Carbimazole, being a pro-drug of Methimazole, shares these risks. Perchlorate is not commonly used for this indication. The retrieved evidence supports the teratogenic risks associated with Methimazole, reinforcing the consensus that PTU is the safer choice during early pregnancy to minimize fetal harm.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"In the treatment of hyperthyroidism during the first trimester of pregnancy, the primary concern is minimizing the risk of teratogenic effects on the developing fetus. Methimazole and its pro-drug Carbimazole are associated with teratogenic risks, particularly when used in the first trimester. Propylthiouracil (PTU) is preferred during this period because it has a better safety profile and is less likely to cause congenital malformations. Perchlorate is not typically used for this indication. Therefore, based on standard medical knowledge and consensus, PTU is the drug of choice for managing hyperthyroidism in the first trimester of pregnancy.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
