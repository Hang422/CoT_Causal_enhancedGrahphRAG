Mouth\nopb. Stomach\nopc. Small intestine\nopd. Large intestine\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nThe digestion of disaccharides primarily occurs in the small intestine. Disaccharides are ingested and pass through the mouth and stomach without significant digestion, as salivary amylase does not effectively break down disaccharides, and stomach acid does not digest them. Once in the small intestine, specific enzymes such as maltase, sucrase, and lactase act on disaccharides, breaking them down into monosaccharides. This aligns with the consensus that the small intestine is the primary site for disaccharide digestion. The retrieved evidence paths, while broad, support the role of the small intestine in processing disaccharides, as indicated by the presence of pancreatic enzymes and the interaction of disaccharides with enzymes in this region.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

This is because the enzymes responsible for breaking down disaccharides into monosaccharides, such as maltase, sucrase, and lactase, are located in the small intestine. In the mouth, salivary amylase does not significantly affect disaccharides, and the stomach's acidic environment does not contribute to their digestion. Therefore, the small intestine is the primary site where disaccharides are enzymatically broken down into absorbable monosaccharides.
