Duodenum\nopb. Ileum\nopc. Jejunum\nopd. Colon\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nVitamin B12 absorption in the human body requires the presence of intrinsic factor, a protein produced in the stomach. The intrinsic factor binds to vitamin B12, forming a complex that is resistant to digestion in the stomach and small intestine. This complex travels through the digestive tract to the ileum, which is the final part of the small intestine. In the ileum, the intrinsic factor-B12 complex is absorbed into the bloodstream. All reasoning chains correctly identify the ileum as the site of vitamin B12 absorption, aligning with standard medical consensus. The retrieved evidence paths, while broad, support the role of intrinsic factor in the ileum, confirming the consensus that the ileum is the site of vitamin B12 absorption. Therefore, the correct answer is option 'opb. Ileum'.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Vitamin B12 absorption in the human body is a well-understood physiological process. The intrinsic factor, produced by the parietal cells of the stomach, binds to vitamin B12, forming a complex that is resistant to digestion. This complex travels through the small intestine to the ileum, where specific receptors facilitate its absorption into the bloodstream. The ileum is the final part of the small intestine and is the recognized site for vitamin B12 absorption.
