B1\nopb. B2\nopc. B6\nopd. B12\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nWernicke's encephalopathy is primarily associated with a deficiency in thiamine, which is vitamin B1. This condition is often linked to chronic alcoholism, which can lead to poor nutrition and thiamine deficiency. The retrieved evidence supports this by showing that Wernicke's encephalopathy is caused by thiamine deficiency and is complicated by chronic alcoholic intoxication. Other evidence paths, such as those linking Wernicke's encephalopathy to malabsorption syndromes, also align with the consensus that thiamine deficiency is significant in this condition. Therefore, the major vitamin deficiency in Wernicke's encephalopathy is vitamin B1.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "
