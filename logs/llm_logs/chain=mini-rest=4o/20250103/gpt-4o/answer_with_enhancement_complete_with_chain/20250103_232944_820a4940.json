They are called as \"high ceiling\" diuretics\nopb. They act on Na+.K+.2Cl- symporter\nopc. They can cause hyperuricemia\nopd. Loop diuretics lead to hypercalcemia and hypomagnesimia\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nLoop diuretics are known as 'high ceiling' diuretics because they can cause a significant increase in urine output. They act by inhibiting the Na+.K+.2Cl- symporter in the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle, which is consistent with standard pharmacological understanding. This action can lead to increased excretion of sodium, potassium, and chloride, and is associated with hypocalcemia and hypomagnesemia, not hypercalcemia. Loop diuretics can also cause hyperuricemia due to increased reabsorption of uric acid. Therefore, the statement that loop diuretics lead to hypercalcemia is incorrect. The retrieved evidence paths broadly support the role of loop diuretics in affecting renal excretory function and their association with hypomagnesemia and hypocalcemia, but do not directly support the incorrect claim of hypercalcemia.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "
