Adenylyl cyclase\nopc. Na+-K+-ATPase\nopd. Galactosyl transferase\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nEnzymatic markers of the plasma membrane typically include enzymes such as 5'-nucleotidase, adenylyl cyclase, and Na+-K+-ATPase, all of which are associated with the plasma membrane. 5'-nucleotidase is known for its role in nucleotide metabolism at the cell surface, adenylyl cyclase is involved in the conversion of ATP to cyclic AMP and is a key component of signal transduction pathways at the plasma membrane, and Na+-K+-ATPase is crucial for maintaining the electrochemical gradient across the plasma membrane. In contrast, galactosyl transferase is primarily located in the Golgi apparatus, where it functions in glycosylation processes, making it an exception to the list of plasma membrane enzymatic markers. The retrieved evidence paths support the association of adenylyl cyclase with the cell membrane, reinforcing its role as a plasma membrane enzyme. Therefore, the correct answer is that galactosyl transferase is not an enzymatic marker of the plasma membrane.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "
