Vasopressin\nopb. Terlipressin\nopc. Desmopressin\nopd. Pralipressin\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nNeurogenic diabetes insipidus is characterized by insufficient production of antidiuretic hormone (ADH), also known as vasopressin. The standard treatment involves replacing this hormone to manage symptoms such as excessive urination. Desmopressin, a synthetic analog of vasopressin, is the drug of choice due to its efficacy in mimicking ADH, reducing urine output, and improving symptoms. It is preferred over vasopressin itself because of its better safety profile and effectiveness. The retrieved evidence paths, while broad, confirm that Deamino Arginine Vasopressin (Desmopressin) is a pharmaceutical preparation used in treating conditions like central diabetes insipidus, aligning with the consensus that Desmopressin is the appropriate treatment for neurogenic diabetes insipidus.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "
