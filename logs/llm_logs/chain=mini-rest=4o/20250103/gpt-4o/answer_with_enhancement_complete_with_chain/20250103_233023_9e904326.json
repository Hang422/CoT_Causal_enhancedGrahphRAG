Dexamethasone\nopb. Betamethasone\nopc. Hydrocoisone\nopd. Prednisolone\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nIn the context of a pregnant female suspected of having a baby with congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), the primary concern is preventing virilization in a female fetus. The standard medical consensus supports the use of dexamethasone for this purpose, as it effectively reduces fetal androgen production. Dexamethasone is preferred over other corticosteroids like betamethasone, which is primarily used for promoting fetal lung maturity, and hydrocortisone, which is used for treating adrenal insufficiency but not specifically for preventing virilization in CAH. Prednisolone is less effective than dexamethasone in this context. The evidence paths, while broad, indicate interactions between dexamethasone and other corticosteroids, supporting its role in managing conditions associated with CAH. Therefore, dexamethasone is the drug of choice for preventing virilization in a fetus at risk of CAH.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) is a group of genetic disorders affecting the adrenal glands, leading to an overproduction of androgens. In a pregnant female suspected of having a baby with CAH, particularly when there is a risk of virilization in a female fetus, the goal is to reduce fetal androgen production. Dexamethasone is the drug of choice in this scenario because it crosses the placenta and suppresses fetal adrenal androgen production effectively. Other corticosteroids like betamethasone, hydrocortisone, and prednisolone are not as effective for this specific purpose. Betamethasone is primarily used for fetal lung maturity, hydrocortisone is used for adrenal insufficiency, and prednisolone does not cross the placenta as effectively as dexamethasone. Therefore, based on standard medical knowledge and consensus, dexamethasone is the most appropriate choice.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
