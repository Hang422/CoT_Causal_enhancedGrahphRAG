Fibrinolysis\nopb. Activation of collagenase\nopc. Destruction of VWF\nopd. Stabilization of fibrin\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nPlasmin is primarily known for its role in fibrinolysis, where it breaks down fibrin, a key component of blood clots. This aligns with the evidence path showing plasmin causing fibrinolysis. Plasmin does not activate collagenase, as collagenase activation is not a recognized function of plasmin. The evidence path linking fibrinolysis to collagenase is too broad and not directly relevant to plasmin's function. Plasmin is also not involved in the stabilization of fibrin; rather, it degrades fibrin, opposing stabilization. The role of plasmin in the destruction of von Willebrand factor (VWF) is not well-established in standard consensus, making it an uncertain function. Therefore, the correct answer is that plasmin does not stabilize fibrin.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Plasmin is an enzyme primarily involved in fibrinolysis, where it breaks down fibrin in blood clots. This is a well-established function. Plasmin does not activate collagenase, as this is not a recognized function of plasmin. The destruction of von Willebrand factor (VWF) by plasmin is not a well-documented or primary function, making it uncertain. Plasmin is known to degrade fibrin, which is contrary to the stabilization of fibrin. Therefore, the function of stabilizing fibrin is directly opposed to the known action of plasmin, which is to break down fibrin. Based on this analysis, the most likely correct answer is that plasmin does not stabilize fibrin.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
