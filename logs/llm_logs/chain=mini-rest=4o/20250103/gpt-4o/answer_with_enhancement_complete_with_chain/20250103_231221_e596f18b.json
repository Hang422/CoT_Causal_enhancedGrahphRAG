Secretin is released in response to acidic chyme entering the duodenum. It stimulates the pancreatic duct cells to secrete bicarbonate-rich fluid, which neutralizes gastric acid in the duodenum, creating an optimal pH for digestive enzyme activity. This aligns with the consensus that Secretin's primary role is to promote bicarbonate secretion, as supported by evidence paths indicating Secretin's effect on pancreatic fluid secretion and the role of the pancreas in bicarbonate production. While Secretin also has minor roles in inhibiting gastric acid secretion and affecting pyloric sphincter contraction, these are not its primary actions.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

It is released by the S cells of the duodenum in response to acidic chyme entering from the stomach. The primary and most important action of Secretin is to stimulate the pancreas to secrete a bicarbonate-rich fluid. This bicarbonate neutralizes the gastric acid in the duodenum, providing an optimal pH for the activity of digestive enzymes. While Secretin also has secondary effects such as decreasing gastric acid secretion and influencing the pyloric sphincter, these are not its primary functions. The consensus in medical physiology supports that the most critical role of Secretin is to increase the secretion of bicarbonates by the pancreas.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
