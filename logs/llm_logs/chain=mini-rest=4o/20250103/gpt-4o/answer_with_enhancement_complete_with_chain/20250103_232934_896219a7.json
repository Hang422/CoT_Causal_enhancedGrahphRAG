Strongyloidiasis\nopb. Trichomoniasis\nopc. Schistosomiasis\nopd. Rhinosporidiosis\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nPraziquantel is an antiparasitic medication primarily effective against trematodes, making it the treatment of choice for schistosomiasis, a disease caused by trematode parasites. It is not effective against nematodes, and therefore not used for strongyloidiasis, which is caused by nematodes. Additionally, praziquantel is not indicated for trichomoniasis, a protozoan infection, as confirmed by the evidence path linking Trichomonas infections to protozoan infections. Lastly, praziquantel is not used for rhinosporidiosis, which is caused by a fungus, not a parasite. Therefore, the correct use of praziquantel is for the treatment of schistosomiasis.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

Schistosomiasis is caused by trematode parasites, and praziquantel is the drug of choice for this condition. It is not effective against nematodes, protozoans, or fungi, which rules out its use for strongyloidiasis, trichomoniasis, and rhinosporidiosis, respectively.
