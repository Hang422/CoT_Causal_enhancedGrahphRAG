      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in the field of Biochemistry.\n                    You are a medical expert determining the final answer.\n\n            ### Instructions:\n            - Use standard medical knowledge as the primary guide.\n            - Consider enhanced information only if it aligns with consensus.\n            - If conflicting or unclear, present the most likely correct answer based on known facts.\n            - It's acceptable to show moderate confidence if the question is complex, but still choose one best answer.\n\n\n                    ### Question\n                    Starvation and diabetes mellitus can lead on to ketoacidosis which of the following features is in our of ketoacidosis due to diabetes mellitus.\n\n                    ### Options\n                    opa. Increase in glucagon/insulin ratio, increased CAMP and increased blood glucose\nopb. Decreased insulin, increased free fatty acid which is equivalent to blood glucose\nopc. Decreased insulin, increased free fatty acid which is not equivalent to blood glucose\nopd. Elevated insulin and free fatty acid, equivalent to blood glucose\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nIn ketoacidosis due to diabetes mellitus, the key feature is a decreased insulin level leading to an increased glucagon/insulin ratio. This results in elevated cAMP levels and increased blood glucose, which aligns with the pathophysiology of diabetic ketoacidosis. The retrieved evidence supports the interaction between insulin and nonesterified fatty acids, which are elevated due to decreased insulin, contributing to the metabolic state. Option 'opa' correctly reflects this consensus, as it describes the increased glucagon/insulin ratio, increased cAMP, and increased blood glucose, which are characteristic of diabetic ketoacidosis. Options 'opb' and 'opc' correctly note the increase in free fatty acids due to decreased insulin, but 'opc' more accurately reflects that these fatty acids are not equivalent to blood glucose. Option 'opd' is incorrect as elevated insulin is not typical in diabetic ketoacidosis.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"In diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), the primary pathophysiological change is a significant decrease in insulin levels, which leads to an increased glucagon/insulin ratio. This imbalance results in increased gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis, causing elevated blood glucose levels. Additionally, the lack of insulin promotes lipolysis, leading to increased free fatty acids, which are then converted to ketone bodies, contributing to acidosis. The increased glucagon/insulin ratio also elevates cAMP levels, further promoting these metabolic changes. Option 'opa' accurately describes these features: an increased glucagon/insulin ratio, increased cAMP, and increased blood glucose, which are characteristic of DKA. While options 'opb' and 'opc' mention increased free fatty acids due to decreased insulin, 'opc' correctly notes that these fatty acids are not equivalent to blood glucose. However, 'opa' provides a more comprehensive description of the key features of DKA. Option 'opd' is incorrect as elevated insulin is not typical in DKA.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
