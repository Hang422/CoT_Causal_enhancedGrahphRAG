Retro bulbar neuritis\nopb. Deafness\nopc. Red urine\nopd. Peripheral neuritis\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nEthambutol is primarily associated with causing retrobulbar neuritis, a type of visual disturbance, as a side effect. This aligns with the consensus that ethambutol can lead to optic neuropathy, particularly affecting the optic nerve behind the eye, leading to visual impairment. The reasoning chains correctly identify retrobulbar neuritis as a known side effect, supported by the consensus that visual disturbances are a common adverse effect of ethambutol. The retrieved evidence paths suggesting a link between ethambutol and deafness are not directly relevant, as ethambutol is not commonly associated with hearing loss. Peripheral neuritis and red urine are not typical side effects of ethambutol, and the reasoning chains suggesting these are less supported by standard medical consensus. Therefore, the most accurate and consensus-aligned answer is that ethambutol causes retrobulbar neuritis.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Ethambutol is an antitubercular medication known for its potential to cause visual disturbances, specifically retrobulbar neuritis. This condition involves inflammation of the optic nerve, leading to symptoms such as decreased visual acuity and color vision changes. The enhanced information supports this, aligning with the standard medical consensus that retrobulbar neuritis is a recognized side effect of ethambutol. Other options such as deafness, red urine, and peripheral neuritis are not commonly associated with ethambutol. Therefore, the most likely correct answer, based on medical consensus, is that ethambutol causes retrobulbar neuritis.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
