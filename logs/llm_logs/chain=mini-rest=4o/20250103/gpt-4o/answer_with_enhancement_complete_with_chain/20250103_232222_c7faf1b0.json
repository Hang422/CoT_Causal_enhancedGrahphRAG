Methotrexate\nopb. Doxorubicin\nopc. Cisplatin\nopd. Busulfan\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nMethotrexate and Busulfan are both known to cause pulmonary toxicity that can lead to pulmonary fibrosis, aligning with standard medical consensus. Methotrexate is particularly noted for its potential to cause pulmonary fibrosis as a complication of its use. Busulfan is also recognized for causing pulmonary fibrosis, especially in the context of its use in bone marrow transplantation. The evidence paths support these associations by linking Methotrexate and Busulfan to lung-related processes. Doxorubicin, while associated with various pulmonary complications, is less commonly linked to pulmonary fibrosis. Cisplatin can cause lung toxicity but is not typically associated with pulmonary fibrosis. Therefore, Methotrexate and Busulfan are the most relevant options for pulmonary fibrosis as a complication.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Pulmonary fibrosis is a known complication of certain medications due to their potential to cause lung damage. Methotrexate is widely recognized for its association with pulmonary fibrosis, as it can induce lung toxicity leading to this condition. Busulfan is also known to cause pulmonary fibrosis, particularly in the context of its use in bone marrow transplantation. While Doxorubicin and Cisplatin can cause pulmonary complications, they are less commonly linked to pulmonary fibrosis specifically. Given the options, Methotrexate and Busulfan are the most relevant drugs associated with pulmonary fibrosis. However, Methotrexate is more frequently highlighted in medical literature for this specific complication. Therefore, based on standard medical knowledge and consensus, Methotrexate is the most likely correct answer.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
