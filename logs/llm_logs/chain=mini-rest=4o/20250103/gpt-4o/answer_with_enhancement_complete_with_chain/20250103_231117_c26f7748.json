Clonazepam\nopb. Sodium Valproate\nopc. Phenobarbitone\nopd. Ethosuximide\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nIn treating myoclonus in children, Clonazepam is widely recognized as an effective option due to its efficacy in reducing myoclonic jerks, aligning with the consensus that it treats myoclonic seizures. Sodium Valproate is also used for various seizure types, including myoclonic seizures, but is generally considered a secondary option compared to Clonazepam. Phenobarbitone, while an anticonvulsant, is less effective for myoclonic seizures and not typically recommended as a first-line treatment. Ethosuximide is primarily used for absence seizures and is not effective for myoclonic seizures, thus not recommended. The evidence paths confirm Clonazepam's role in treating myoclonus and support the consensus that it is the preferred treatment option.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "
