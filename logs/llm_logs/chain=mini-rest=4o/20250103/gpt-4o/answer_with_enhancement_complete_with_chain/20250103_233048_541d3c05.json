Chloroquine\nopb. Betamethasone\nopc. Chloramphenicol\nopd. Zidovudine\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nChloroquine is primarily used for malaria treatment and is not commonly associated with myopathy, aligning with standard medical consensus. Betamethasone, a corticosteroid, can cause muscle weakness and is associated with myopathy, supported by its interaction with adrenal cortex hormones. Chloramphenicol, an antibiotic, is rarely associated with myopathy, making it a less likely cause compared to others. Zidovudine, used for HIV treatment, is well-known to cause myopathy and muscle damage. Therefore, among the options, Chloroquine is the drug least associated with causing myopathy.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"To determine which drug does not cause myopathy, we need to consider the known side effects of each option. Chloroquine is primarily used for malaria and is not commonly associated with myopathy, although it can cause other muscle-related issues like neuromyopathy in rare cases. Betamethasone, a corticosteroid, is known to cause muscle weakness and myopathy due to its catabolic effects on muscle tissue. Chloramphenicol, an antibiotic, is rarely associated with myopathy, making it a less likely cause compared to others. Zidovudine, an antiretroviral drug used for HIV treatment, is well-documented to cause myopathy and muscle damage. Based on this information, Chloramphenicol is the drug least associated with causing myopathy, as it is rarely linked to this condition compared to the others.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opc\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
