Propanolol\nopb. Oral contraceptives\nopc. Reserpine\nopd. Flupenthixol\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nPropranolol is primarily used to treat anxiety and is not typically associated with causing depression, aligning with the consensus that it is not a common side effect. Oral contraceptives can cause mood changes due to hormonal fluctuations, and while depression is not a common side effect, it can occur in some individuals. Reserpine is well-known for depleting monoamines, which is strongly associated with causing depression, making it likely to induce depressive symptoms. Flupenthixol, an antipsychotic, can cause depressive symptoms, although it is not its primary effect. Therefore, based on consensus and evidence, depression is not a side effect of propranolol.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"To determine which medication does not have depression as a side effect, we need to consider the pharmacological profiles of each option. Propranolol, a beta-blocker, is primarily used for cardiovascular conditions and anxiety, and while it can cause mood changes, depression is not a common side effect. Oral contraceptives can cause mood changes due to hormonal effects, and depression can occur in some individuals. Reserpine is known for depleting monoamines, which is strongly associated with causing depression. Flupenthixol, an antipsychotic, can cause depressive symptoms, although it is not its primary effect. Based on this analysis, propranolol is the least likely to cause depression as a side effect.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
