This results in the production of large volumes of dilute urine. The standard medical consensus is that urine osmolality in Diabetes insipidus is typically low, often less than 300 mmol/L. The reasoning chain for option 'opb' aligns with this consensus, as it correctly identifies the inability to concentrate urine due to ADH deficiency, resulting in urine osmolality of less than 300 mmol/L. Other options suggesting higher osmolality values (e.g., <600 mmol/L or <900 mmol/L) do not align with the typical presentation of Diabetes insipidus. The retrieved evidence path, while broad, does not directly address urine osmolality and is not relevant to refining the consensus understanding of this condition.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "
