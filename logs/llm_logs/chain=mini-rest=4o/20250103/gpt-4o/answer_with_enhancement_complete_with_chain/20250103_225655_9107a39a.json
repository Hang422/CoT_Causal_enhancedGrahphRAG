Morphine patch\nopb. Diazepam\nopc. Clobazam\nopd. Haloperidol\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nIn the management of dyspnoea in a lung cancer patient, morphine is widely recognized for its effectiveness in reducing the perception of breathlessness, thus providing significant palliation of dyspnoea. This aligns with the evidence path indicating that morphine prevents dyspnoea. Diazepam and clobazam, both having anxiolytic effects, may help reduce anxiety-related dyspnoea, but their primary role is not direct palliation of dyspnoea. The evidence paths support the anxiolytic effects of these medications but do not directly link them to dyspnoea relief. Haloperidol, primarily an antipsychotic, has an unclear impact on dyspnoea and is not typically used for this purpose. Therefore, the morphine patch is the most consensus-supported option for palliation of dyspnoea in this context.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"In the management of dyspnoea in lung cancer patients, morphine is well-documented for its ability to alleviate the sensation of breathlessness. This is due to its action on the central nervous system, which reduces the perception of dyspnoea. While diazepam and clobazam can help with anxiety, which may indirectly affect breathing comfort, they do not directly palliate dyspnoea. Haloperidol is primarily used as an antipsychotic and is not typically indicated for dyspnoea relief. Therefore, based on standard medical knowledge and consensus, the morphine patch is the most appropriate choice for palliation of dyspnoea in this context.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
