Protein linked with glycosidic bond\nopb. Core protein\nopc. Sugar residues are long in carbohydrate poion of glycoprotein\nopd. None\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nGlycoproteins are biomolecules composed of protein and carbohydrate components. The protein part is linked to carbohydrate residues through glycosidic bonds, which is a defining characteristic of glycoproteins. This aligns with the consensus that glycoproteins have protein linked with glycosidic bonds. The term 'core protein' is often used in the context of proteoglycans rather than glycoproteins, so this is less applicable here. The carbohydrate portion of glycoproteins can vary in length, but it is not universally long; thus, the statement that sugar residues are long is not a defining characteristic. The evidence path indicating glycoproteins interact with cells and proteins supports the idea that glycoproteins are integral to cellular functions, but it does not directly address the specific characteristics in question. Therefore, the most accurate characteristic of glycoproteins is that they are proteins linked with glycosidic bonds.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

The linkage between the carbohydrate and the protein is typically through a glycosidic bond, which is a defining feature of glycoproteins. The term 'core protein' is more relevant to proteoglycans, where a core protein is heavily glycosylated with glycosaminoglycans. The length of sugar residues in glycoproteins can vary and is not a defining characteristic, as glycoproteins can have short or long carbohydrate chains. Therefore, the most accurate characteristic of glycoproteins is that they are proteins linked with glycosidic bonds.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
