All of the following are true about heparin except-\n\n                    ### Options\n                    opa. Weakest acid found in living things\nopb. Most commercial preparations of heparin now utilize pig intestinal slimes\nopc. Act via Antithrombin activation\nopd. Produce thrombocytopenia\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nHeparin is a widely used anticoagulant in cardiac surgery. It acts by activating Antithrombin, which inhibits thrombin and factor Xa, confirming its anticoagulant mechanism (Option C is true). Most commercial heparin is derived from pig intestinal mucosa, aligning with standard production practices (Option B is true). Heparin can cause thrombocytopenia, a condition characterized by a decrease in platelet count, which is a known side effect (Option D is true). However, heparin is a polysaccharide and not classified as an acid, making the statement that it is the 'weakest acid found in living things' incorrect (Option A is false). The retrieved evidence paths support these points by confirming heparin's interaction with thrombin and its derivation from intestinal mucosa, while also noting its potential to cause thrombocytopenia.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

It functions primarily by activating Antithrombin, which in turn inhibits thrombin and factor Xa, confirming the mechanism described in option C. Most commercial heparin is indeed derived from pig intestinal mucosa, which supports option B. Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia is a recognized side effect, validating option D. However, heparin is a polysaccharide and not classified as an acid, making option A incorrect.
