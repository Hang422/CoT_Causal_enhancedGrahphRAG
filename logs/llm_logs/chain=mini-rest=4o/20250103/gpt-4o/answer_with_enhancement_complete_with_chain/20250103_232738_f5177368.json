Retinol\nopb. Retinal\nopc. Retinoic acids\nopd. All of the above\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nVitamin A functions are related to retinol, retinal, and retinoic acids, which are all forms of vitamin A. Retinol is crucial for immune function and skin health, retinal is essential for vision as it is a component of rhodopsin involved in phototransduction, and retinoic acids are involved in gene expression by regulating transcription. All these forms contribute to the overall functions of vitamin A, including vision, immune support, and skin health. The retrieved evidence paths, while broad, support the involvement of vitamin A in processes related to the retina, which aligns with its role in vision. Therefore, the function of vitamin A is related to all of the above forms: retinol, retinal, and retinoic acids.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Vitamin A is a group of compounds that includes retinol, retinal, and retinoic acids, each playing distinct roles in the body. Retinol is important for immune function and skin health, retinal is crucial for vision as it forms part of the visual pigment rhodopsin, and retinoic acids are involved in regulating gene expression. These functions are well-documented in medical literature, and all these forms are interrelated in the context of vitamin A's biological roles. Therefore, the function of vitamin A is related to all of these forms, making option 'opd. All of the above' the most accurate choice.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
