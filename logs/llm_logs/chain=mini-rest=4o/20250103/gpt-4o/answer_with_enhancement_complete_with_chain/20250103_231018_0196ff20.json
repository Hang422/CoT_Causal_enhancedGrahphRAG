Ototoxicity\nopb. Nephrotoxicity\nopc. Coasting effect\nopd. Pulmonary fibrosis\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nCisplatin is well-documented to cause ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity, which aligns with the retrieved evidence paths showing its association with ototoxicity and toxic nephropathy leading to renal impairment. The 'coasting effect' is not typically associated with Cisplatin; this effect is more commonly linked to other neurotoxic agents, confirming the reasoning chain that Cisplatin does not cause this effect. While the evidence path suggests a potential link between Cisplatin and pulmonary fibrosis, this is not a typical or well-established side effect of Cisplatin. Pulmonary fibrosis is more commonly associated with other chemotherapeutic agents, such as bleomycin. Therefore, the side effect not produced by Cisplatin is pulmonary fibrosis.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Cisplatin is a chemotherapy drug known for its side effects, including ototoxicity (hearing loss) and nephrotoxicity (kidney damage). These are well-documented and common adverse effects of Cisplatin. The 'coasting effect' refers to a phenomenon where symptoms continue to progress even after the cessation of treatment, typically associated with neurotoxic agents, but not specifically with Cisplatin. Pulmonary fibrosis, a condition characterized by scarring of the lung tissue, is not a typical side effect of Cisplatin. It is more commonly associated with other chemotherapeutic agents like bleomycin. Therefore, based on standard medical knowledge and the enhanced information provided, pulmonary fibrosis is the side effect not produced by Cisplatin.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
