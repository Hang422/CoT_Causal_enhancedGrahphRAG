Clindamycin\nopb. Cefepime\nopc. Metronidazole\nopd. Azithromycin\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nThe standard treatment for gonococcal urethritis is ceftriaxone, a cephalosporin antibiotic. However, azithromycin is often used in combination with ceftriaxone to cover potential co-infection with Chlamydia trachomatis, which causes non-gonococcal urethritis. Azithromycin is the preferred treatment for non-gonococcal urethritis due to its effectiveness against Chlamydia. Therefore, azithromycin is commonly recommended for both gonococcal and non-gonococcal urethritis, making it the drug of choice in this context. The retrieved evidence path confirms that gonorrhea causes gonococcal urethritis, supporting the need for effective treatment against both types of urethritis.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The treatment of urethritis depends on whether it is gonococcal or non-gonococcal. Gonococcal urethritis is typically treated with ceftriaxone, but azithromycin is often added to cover potential co-infection with Chlamydia trachomatis, which is a common cause of non-gonococcal urethritis. Azithromycin is effective against Chlamydia and is a recommended treatment for non-gonococcal urethritis. Therefore, azithromycin is frequently used to treat both gonococcal and non-gonococcal urethritis, making it the drug of choice in this context. The other options, clindamycin, cefepime, and metronidazole, are not standard treatments for these conditions. Clindamycin is used for certain bacterial infections, cefepime is a cephalosporin used for different types of infections, and metronidazole is used for anaerobic bacterial and protozoal infections. Thus, azithromycin is the most appropriate choice.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}\n```",
