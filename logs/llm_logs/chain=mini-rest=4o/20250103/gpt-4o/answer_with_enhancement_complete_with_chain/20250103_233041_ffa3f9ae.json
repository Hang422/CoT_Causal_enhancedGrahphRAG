Selenium\nopb. Phosphorus\nopc. Boron\nopd. Zinc\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nSelenium deficiency is well-documented to cause cardiomyopathy due to increased oxidative stress leading to myocardial damage. This aligns with the consensus that selenium is crucial for heart health, and its deficiency can directly lead to cardiomyopathy. Zinc deficiency can lead to impaired immune function and increased inflammation, which might contribute to heart muscle damage, but it is not a primary cause of cardiomyopathy. Phosphorus deficiency affects energy metabolism and cardiac function, but it is not a common cause of cardiomyopathy. Boron deficiency has unclear links to cardiomyopathy, as its role in cardiovascular health is not well-established. Therefore, selenium deficiency is the most directly linked to cardiomyopathy among the options provided.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Cardiomyopathy is a disease of the heart muscle that can be caused by various factors, including nutritional deficiencies. Among the options provided, selenium deficiency is the most well-documented cause of cardiomyopathy. Selenium is an essential trace element that plays a critical role in protecting cells from oxidative damage through its incorporation into selenoproteins, such as glutathione peroxidase. A deficiency in selenium can lead to increased oxidative stress and subsequent myocardial damage, which is a direct cause of cardiomyopathy. While zinc, phosphorus, and boron have roles in various bodily functions, their deficiencies are not primarily associated with cardiomyopathy. Therefore, based on standard medical knowledge and consensus, selenium deficiency is the most likely cause of cardiomyopathy among the given options.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
