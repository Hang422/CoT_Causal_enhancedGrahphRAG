Propanolol\nopb. Aiprazolam\nopc. Buspirone\nopd. Haloperidol\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nPropranolol is used for performance anxiety as it reduces physical symptoms of anxiety, aligning with its role in treating anxiety-related conditions. Alprazolam, a benzodiazepine, is commonly prescribed for anxiety disorders, consistent with its anxiolytic properties. Buspirone is an anxiolytic medication specifically used for generalized anxiety disorder, confirming its role in anxiety treatment. Haloperidol, an antipsychotic, is not primarily used for anxiety; it is mainly indicated for schizophrenia and acute psychosis. Although antipsychotic agents can sometimes be used in anxiety treatment, Haloperidol is not typically indicated for this purpose, aligning with standard treatment guidelines. Therefore, Haloperidol is the drug not used for anxiety.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"To determine which drug is not used for anxiety, we need to consider the primary indications for each medication. Propranolol is a beta-blocker that can be used for performance anxiety due to its ability to reduce physical symptoms like tachycardia. Alprazolam is a benzodiazepine, widely used for its anxiolytic effects in treating anxiety disorders. Buspirone is specifically indicated for generalized anxiety disorder, making it a common choice for anxiety treatment. Haloperidol, on the other hand, is an antipsychotic primarily used for conditions like schizophrenia and acute psychosis. While antipsychotics can sometimes be used off-label for anxiety, Haloperidol is not typically prescribed for this purpose. Therefore, based on standard medical knowledge and treatment guidelines, Haloperidol is the drug not used for anxiety.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
