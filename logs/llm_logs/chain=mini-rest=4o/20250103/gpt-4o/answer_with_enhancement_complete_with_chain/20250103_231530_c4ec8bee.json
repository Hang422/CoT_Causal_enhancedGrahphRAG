Ca transporter\nopb. Cu transporter\nopc. Zn transporter\nopd. Se transporter\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nMenke's Kinky hair syndrome is primarily due to a defect in copper transport, specifically caused by mutations in the ATP7A gene, which impairs the function of copper transporters. This leads to copper deficiency, affecting hair structure and pigmentation, and is associated with neurological symptoms due to copper's essential role in enzyme function. The retrieved evidence supports the link between Menke's syndrome and hypocupremia, which causes neurological symptoms, further confirming the defect in copper transport. Other metal transporters are not primarily involved in this syndrome, aligning with the consensus that the defect is specific to copper transporters.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Menke's Kinky hair syndrome, also known as Menkes disease, is a genetic disorder caused by mutations in the ATP7A gene. This gene is responsible for encoding a copper-transporting ATPase, which is crucial for the proper transport and distribution of copper in the body. The defect in this transporter leads to copper deficiency, which affects various physiological processes, including the structure and pigmentation of hair, resulting in the characteristic 'kinky' hair. The neurological symptoms associated with Menkes disease are also due to the essential role of copper in enzyme function. The enhanced information aligns with the standard medical consensus that the defect is specific to copper transporters, and other metal transporters like calcium, zinc, or selenium are not primarily involved in this syndrome.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 100\n}",
