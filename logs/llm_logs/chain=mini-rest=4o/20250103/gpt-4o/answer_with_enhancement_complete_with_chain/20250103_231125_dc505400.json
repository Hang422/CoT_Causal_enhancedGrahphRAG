Imipramine\nopb. Fluvoxamine\nopc. Phenelzine\nopd. Bupropion\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nImipramine is a tricyclic antidepressant with anticholinergic properties that can reduce bladder contractions, making it effective for treating nocturnal enuresis. This aligns with standard medical consensus and is supported by evidence showing its interaction with tricyclic antidepressants, which are known to treat conditions like bedwetting. Fluvoxamine, an SSRI, and Phenelzine, an MAOI, are not typically used for nocturnal enuresis, as they lack the necessary anticholinergic effects. Bupropion, an atypical antidepressant, is also not indicated for this condition. The evidence paths confirm that while antidepressive agents can influence conditions like bedwetting, Imipramine specifically is the most relevant choice for treating nocturnal enuresis.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The question asks for an antidepressant that can be used in the treatment of nocturnal enuresis. Among the options provided, Imipramine is a tricyclic antidepressant known for its anticholinergic properties, which can help reduce bladder contractions and are effective in treating nocturnal enuresis. This aligns with standard medical knowledge and consensus. The other options, Fluvoxamine (an SSRI), Phenelzine (an MAOI), and Bupropion (an atypical antidepressant), do not have the same anticholinergic effects and are not typically used for this condition. Therefore, Imipramine is the most likely correct answer based on its pharmacological profile and clinical use in nocturnal enuresis.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
