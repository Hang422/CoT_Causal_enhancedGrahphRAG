Anti depressants\nopb. Anti psychotics\nopc. Anti epileptics\nopd. Mood stabilizers\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nSchizophrenia is primarily treated with antipsychotic medications, which are effective in managing psychotic symptoms such as hallucinations and delusions. This aligns with the consensus that antipsychotics are the first-line treatment for schizophrenia, as they improve overall functioning by addressing the core psychotic symptoms. While mood disturbances can occur in schizophrenia, mood stabilizers are not the primary treatment and are less effective than antipsychotics. Antidepressants may be used to manage comorbid conditions like depression, but they are not the primary treatment for schizophrenia itself. Anti-epileptics are not standard in the treatment of schizophrenia, as their role is unclear and not supported by consensus. The retrieved evidence paths confirm that schizophrenia causes psychotic disorders and symptoms, supporting the use of antipsychotics as the main treatment approach.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

The primary treatment for schizophrenia involves the use of antipsychotic medications.
