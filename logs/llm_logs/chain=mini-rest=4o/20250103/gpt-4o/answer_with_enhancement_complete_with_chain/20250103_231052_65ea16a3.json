Vitamin A\nopb. Vitamin B\nopc. Vitamin C\nopd. Vitamin E\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nNyctalopia, commonly known as night blindness, is primarily due to a deficiency of Vitamin A. This condition is characterized by impaired vision in low light conditions and is linked to the health of the retina, where Vitamin A plays a crucial role. Vitamin A is essential for the production and regeneration of rhodopsin, a visual pigment necessary for photoreceptor function in the retina. The retrieved evidence supports this by showing that Vitamin A deficiency is associated with rhodopsin-related degenerative abnormalities and low vision conditions. Therefore, the consensus is that Vitamin A deficiency is the primary cause of nyctalopia.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Nyctalopia, or night blindness, is primarily caused by a deficiency in Vitamin A. This is because Vitamin A is crucial for the production of rhodopsin, a pigment in the retina that is essential for vision in low-light conditions. A deficiency in Vitamin A leads to impaired rhodopsin production, resulting in difficulties seeing in dim light. The enhanced information aligns with the standard medical consensus that Vitamin A deficiency is the primary cause of nyctalopia. Other vitamins listed, such as Vitamin B, C, and E, do not have a direct role in the production of rhodopsin or in the prevention of night blindness.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 100\n}\n```",
