Hyponatremia\nopb. Hyperkalemia\nopc. Hypoglycemia\nopd. Metabolic alkalosis\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nAdrenal insufficiency is characterized by decreased production of cortisol and aldosterone. This leads to hyponatremia due to increased ACTH levels and decreased aldosterone, which causes sodium loss. Hyperkalemia occurs due to decreased aldosterone, leading to potassium retention. Hypoglycemia results from decreased cortisol, impairing gluconeogenesis. Metabolic alkalosis is not typically associated with adrenal insufficiency; instead, metabolic acidosis is more common due to the loss of sodium and retention of hydrogen ions. The evidence paths support the association of adrenal insufficiency with hyponatremia and hyperkalemia, confirming the consensus that metabolic alkalosis is not associated with adrenal insufficiency.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Adrenal insufficiency is characterized by a deficiency in the production of adrenal hormones, primarily cortisol and aldosterone. This condition leads to several metabolic disturbances. Hyponatremia occurs due to the lack of aldosterone, which results in sodium loss. Hyperkalemia is also a consequence of decreased aldosterone, as it normally promotes potassium excretion. Hypoglycemia is a result of decreased cortisol, which is essential for gluconeogenesis and maintaining blood glucose levels. Metabolic alkalosis, however, is not typically associated with adrenal insufficiency. Instead, metabolic acidosis is more common due to the retention of hydrogen ions and loss of bicarbonate. Therefore, the most likely correct answer, based on standard medical knowledge and consensus, is that metabolic alkalosis is not associated with adrenal insufficiency.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
