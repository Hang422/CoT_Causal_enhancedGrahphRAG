Platelet dysfunction\nopb. Aspirin inhibits the action of heparin\nopc. Enhanced hypersensitivity of heparin\nopd. Therapy of heparin cannot be monitored\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nAspirin is an antiplatelet agent that inhibits platelet aggregation, leading to platelet dysfunction and an increased risk of bleeding. This is particularly concerning when combined with heparin, an anticoagulant, as both drugs affect hemostasis and can significantly increase the risk of bleeding. The consensus is that aspirin's effect on platelet function complicates heparin therapy due to the heightened bleeding risk. The retrieved evidence paths, while broad, support the understanding that both aspirin and heparin can lead to platelet dysfunction, reinforcing the rationale for avoiding their concurrent use. Therefore, aspirin is not given to patients on heparin primarily because it causes platelet dysfunction, increasing the risk of bleeding.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Aspirin is known to cause platelet dysfunction by irreversibly inhibiting the enzyme cyclooxygenase, which is crucial for the synthesis of thromboxane A2, a promoter of platelet aggregation. This antiplatelet effect increases the risk of bleeding, especially when used in conjunction with heparin, an anticoagulant that also affects the coagulation cascade. The combination of these two drugs can lead to a significant increase in bleeding risk due to their synergistic effects on hemostasis. Therefore, the primary reason aspirin is not given to patients on heparin is due to its effect on platelet function, which is consistent with the consensus in medical practice.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
