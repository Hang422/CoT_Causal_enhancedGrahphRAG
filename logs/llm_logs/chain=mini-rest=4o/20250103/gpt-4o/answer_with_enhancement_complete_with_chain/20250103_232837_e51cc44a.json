Tyrosine transaminase\nopb. Tyrosine hydroxylase\nopc. Phenylalanine hydroxylase\nopd. Phenylketonuria hydroxylase\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nPhenylketonuria (PKU) is a metabolic disorder caused by a deficiency of the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase. This enzyme is responsible for converting phenylalanine to tyrosine. A deficiency leads to the accumulation of phenylalanine in the blood, which can cause various health issues if not managed. The disorder is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. The reasoning chains correctly identify phenylalanine hydroxylase as the deficient enzyme in PKU. The retrieved evidence paths, while broad, support the association of phenylalanine hydroxylase with phenylalanine metabolism and the genetic basis of the disorder. Therefore, the correct answer is that phenylketonuria is caused by a deficiency of phenylalanine hydroxylase.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Phenylketonuria (PKU) is a well-documented metabolic disorder caused by a deficiency in the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase. This enzyme is crucial for the conversion of phenylalanine to tyrosine. When phenylalanine hydroxylase is deficient, phenylalanine accumulates in the blood, leading to the symptoms associated with PKU. The enhanced information aligns with the standard medical consensus that phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency is the cause of PKU. The other options, such as tyrosine transaminase and tyrosine hydroxylase, are not related to the primary defect in PKU. Therefore, the most likely correct answer is that phenylketonuria is caused by a deficiency of phenylalanine hydroxylase.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opc\",\n  \"confidence\": 100\n}\n```",
