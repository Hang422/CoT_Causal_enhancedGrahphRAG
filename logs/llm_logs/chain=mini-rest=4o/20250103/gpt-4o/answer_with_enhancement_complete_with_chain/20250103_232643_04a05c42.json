Penicillin G\nopb. Tetracycline\nopc. Azithromycin\nopd. Doxycycline\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nThe drug of choice for Treponema pallidum, which causes syphilis, is Penicillin G. This aligns with the standard medical consensus that Penicillin G is the first-line treatment for syphilis due to its high efficacy against Treponema pallidum. While tetracycline and doxycycline are alternative treatments, they are less preferred compared to Penicillin G. Azithromycin can be used in patients allergic to penicillin, but it is not the first-line treatment. The evidence path confirming that the first-line treatment for syphilis involves Treponema pallidum supports the consensus that Penicillin G is the most effective option.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The treatment of choice for infections caused by Treponema pallidum, the bacterium responsible for syphilis, is Penicillin G. This is based on its proven efficacy and long-standing use as the first-line treatment. While alternatives like tetracycline and doxycycline exist, they are typically reserved for patients who cannot tolerate penicillin. Azithromycin is also an alternative but is not preferred due to concerns about resistance and efficacy. The enhanced information aligns with the standard medical consensus, reinforcing that Penicillin G remains the most effective and reliable treatment for syphilis.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
