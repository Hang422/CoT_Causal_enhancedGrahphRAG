Protein C deficiency\nopb. Protein S deficiency\nopc. Hemophillia\nopd. Antithrombin III deficiency\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nWarfarin-induced skin necrosis is most commonly associated with Protein C deficiency. Warfarin inhibits vitamin K-dependent clotting factors, including Protein C, which is a natural anticoagulant. In individuals with Protein C deficiency, this inhibition can lead to a paradoxical increase in thrombosis risk, resulting in skin necrosis. The evidence paths support this by linking skin necrosis to conditions like Purpura Fulminans, which is associated with Protein C deficiency. While Protein S deficiency can also be involved, it is less commonly associated with warfarin-induced skin necrosis. Hemophilia and Antithrombin III deficiency are not typically linked to this condition. Therefore, the most consensus-aligned answer is Protein C deficiency.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Warfarin-induced skin necrosis is a rare but serious complication that occurs due to the paradoxical prothrombotic effect of warfarin in the initial phase of treatment. This is primarily because warfarin inhibits vitamin K-dependent clotting factors, including Protein C, which is a natural anticoagulant. In individuals with Protein C deficiency, the rapid decrease in Protein C levels compared to other clotting factors can lead to a hypercoagulable state, resulting in thrombosis and skin necrosis. While Protein S deficiency can also contribute to a similar risk, it is less commonly associated with this specific complication. Hemophilia and Antithrombin III deficiency are not typically linked to warfarin-induced skin necrosis. Therefore, based on standard medical knowledge and consensus, Protein C deficiency is the most likely cause of warfarin-induced skin necrosis.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
