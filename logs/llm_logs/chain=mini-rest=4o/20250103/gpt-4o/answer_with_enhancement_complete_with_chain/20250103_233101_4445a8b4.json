Quinine\nopb. Chloroquine\nopc. Mefloquine\nopd. Atovaquone\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nChloroquine is known to cause retinal toxicity, which can lead to retinal pigmentation changes. This aligns with the consensus that chloroquine can cause retinopathy, characterized by pigmentation changes in the retina. The retrieved evidence paths, while broad, support the involvement of chloroquine in retinal processes, reinforcing its link to retinal pigmentation changes. Quinine has possible retinal effects, but there is no clear consensus on its impact on pigmentation. Mefloquine is associated with neuropsychiatric side effects and lacks an established link to retinal pigmentation. Atovaquone is primarily known for its antimalarial action and does not have known retinal toxicity. Therefore, chloroquine is the most likely option to cause retinal pigmentation changes.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Chloroquine is well-documented in medical literature to cause retinal toxicity, which can manifest as changes in retinal pigmentation. This condition is often referred to as chloroquine retinopathy or maculopathy. The mechanism involves the drug's accumulation in the retinal pigment epithelium, leading to damage and subsequent pigmentation changes. Quinine, while having some retinal effects, does not have a strong association with pigmentation changes. Mefloquine is primarily linked to neuropsychiatric effects, and atovaquone lacks any significant retinal toxicity profile. Therefore, based on the consensus and available evidence, chloroquine is the most likely cause of retinal pigmentation changes.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
