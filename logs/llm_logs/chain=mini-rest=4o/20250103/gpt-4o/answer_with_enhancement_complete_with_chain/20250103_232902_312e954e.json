Penicillin\nopb. Cotrimoxazole\nopc. Kanamycin\nopd. Levofloxacin\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nPneumonia caused by Pneumocystis jirovecii (formerly known as P. carinii) is commonly associated with immunocompromised patients, particularly those with HIV/AIDS. The standard treatment for this type of pneumonia is Cotrimoxazole (Trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole), which is effective against P. jirovecii. This aligns with standard treatment guidelines and is supported by the reasoning chains that highlight Cotrimoxazole as the first-line treatment. Other antibiotics such as Penicillin, Kanamycin, and Levofloxacin are not effective for this condition. The retrieved evidence paths, while broad, confirm the interaction of Trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole with conditions related to immunocompromised states, supporting its use in treating P. jirovecii pneumonia. Therefore, Cotrimoxazole is the drug of choice for pneumonia caused by P. jirovecii.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "
