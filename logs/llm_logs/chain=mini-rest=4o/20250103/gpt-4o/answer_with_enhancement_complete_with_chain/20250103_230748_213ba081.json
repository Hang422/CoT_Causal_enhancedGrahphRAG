Stomach\nopb. Duodenum\nopc. Ileum\nopd. Duodenum + Jejunum\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nIron absorption primarily occurs in the duodenum, which is the first part of the small intestine. This is supported by the consensus that the duodenum is a key site for nutrient absorption, including iron. While the jejunum can contribute to nutrient absorption, the majority of iron absorption takes place in the duodenum. The retrieved evidence paths confirm the role of the duodenum in iron absorption, as it is a location where iron is processed. Therefore, the most accurate answer is that iron is absorbed in the duodenum.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Iron absorption primarily occurs in the duodenum, which is the first part of the small intestine. This is a well-established fact in physiology, as the duodenum is specifically adapted for the absorption of iron due to its acidic environment and the presence of specific transport proteins. While the jejunum can absorb nutrients, the majority of iron absorption takes place in the duodenum. The enhanced information aligns with the consensus that the duodenum is the key site for iron absorption. Therefore, the most accurate answer is that iron is absorbed in the duodenum.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
