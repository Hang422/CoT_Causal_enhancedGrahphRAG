Stroma\nopb. Corpora albicans\nopc. Corpora lutea\nopd. Mature follicles\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nProgesterone production in the ovary is primarily by the corpus luteum. This is supported by the consensus that after ovulation, the mature follicle transforms into the corpus luteum, which is the main structure responsible for progesterone secretion. The retrieved evidence paths confirm that the structure of the corpus luteum is directly associated with progesterone production. Other structures such as the stroma, corpora albicans, and mature follicles do not primarily produce progesterone. The stroma serves a supportive role, the corpora albicans is a degenerated corpus luteum and does not produce significant hormones, and mature follicles are involved in ovulation but not in progesterone production. Therefore, the corpus luteum is the correct answer.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Progesterone is a hormone crucial for the regulation of the menstrual cycle and maintenance of pregnancy. In the ovary, progesterone production is primarily associated with the corpus luteum. After ovulation, the mature follicle transforms into the corpus luteum, which is the main structure responsible for secreting progesterone. The stroma of the ovary provides structural support and does not primarily produce hormones. The corpora albicans is the scar tissue that forms after the corpus luteum degenerates and does not produce significant hormones. Mature follicles are involved in the process leading up to ovulation and primarily produce estrogen, not progesterone. Therefore, based on standard medical knowledge and consensus, the corpus luteum is the primary source of progesterone production in the ovary.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opc\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
