Vitamin B9\nopb. Vitamin B12\nopc. Vitamin B6\nopd. Vitamin B3\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nIsoniazid is known to interfere with the metabolism of pyridoxine (vitamin B6), leading to a potential deficiency. This interference can result in decreased levels of vitamin B6, which is crucial for various bodily functions, including nerve health. The retrieved evidence supports this by linking pyridoxine to the treatment of peripheral neuropathy, a condition that can arise from vitamin B6 deficiency. Therefore, among the options provided, vitamin B6 deficiency is the most likely to be seen in patients on isoniazid therapy, aligning with standard medical consensus.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Isoniazid is an antibiotic commonly used in the treatment of tuberculosis. It is well-documented in medical literature that isoniazid can lead to a deficiency in vitamin B6 (pyridoxine). This occurs because isoniazid interferes with the metabolism of pyridoxine, which can result in symptoms such as peripheral neuropathy if not supplemented. The standard medical practice is to co-prescribe vitamin B6 with isoniazid to prevent this deficiency. The enhanced information aligns with this consensus, confirming that vitamin B6 deficiency is the most likely to be seen in patients on isoniazid therapy.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opc\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
