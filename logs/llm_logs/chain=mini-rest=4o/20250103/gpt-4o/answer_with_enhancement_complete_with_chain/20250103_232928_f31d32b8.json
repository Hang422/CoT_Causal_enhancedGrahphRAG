Hyperparathyroidism\nopb. Diabetes mellitus\nopc. Kwashiorkor\nopd. Primary aldosteronism\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nHypermagnesemia is not typically associated with hyperparathyroidism, as the condition primarily affects calcium and phosphate metabolism rather than magnesium. In diabetes mellitus, renal impairment can lead to decreased magnesium excretion, potentially causing hypermagnesemia, which aligns with the retrieved evidence path linking diabetes to renal insufficiency. Kwashiorkor, characterized by severe malnutrition, can lead to various electrolyte imbalances, but there is no clear consensus linking it directly to hypermagnesemia. Primary aldosteronism usually results in increased renal excretion of magnesium, leading to lower serum magnesium levels, not hypermagnesemia. Therefore, among the options, diabetes mellitus has the most plausible link to hypermagnesemia due to potential renal complications.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Hypermagnesemia is a condition characterized by elevated levels of magnesium in the blood. It is most commonly associated with renal failure, where the kidneys are unable to excrete magnesium efficiently. In the context of the given options, diabetes mellitus (opb) can lead to renal impairment, which may result in decreased excretion of magnesium and subsequent hypermagnesemia. Hyperparathyroidism (opa) primarily affects calcium and phosphate metabolism, not magnesium. Kwashiorkor (opc) involves severe malnutrition and can cause various electrolyte imbalances, but there is no strong link to hypermagnesemia. Primary aldosteronism (opd) typically causes increased renal excretion of magnesium, leading to hypomagnesemia rather than hypermagnesemia. Therefore, the most likely correct answer is diabetes mellitus due to its potential to cause renal complications that can lead to hypermagnesemia.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
