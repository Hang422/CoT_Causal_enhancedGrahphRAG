Produced by alpha cells of pancreas\nopb. Two polypeptide chains are bound by disulfide linkages\nopc. Shifts potassium outside the cell\nopd. S.c insulin tl/2 is 60 mins\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nOption a is incorrect because insulin is produced by beta cells, not alpha cells, which produce glucagon. Option b is correct; insulin consists of two polypeptide chains (A and B) linked by disulfide bonds. Option c is incorrect; insulin facilitates the uptake of potassium into cells, not out of them. Option d is incorrect; the half-life of subcutaneous insulin is typically shorter, around 4-6 minutes for circulating insulin, but the duration of action can be longer depending on the formulation. The retrieved evidence paths broadly support the role of insulin in metabolism and physiological processes but do not directly address the specifics of these options.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"To determine the true statement regarding insulin, we evaluate each option based on standard medical knowledge. Option a is incorrect because insulin is produced by the beta cells of the pancreas, not the alpha cells, which produce glucagon. Option b is correct; insulin is composed of two polypeptide chains (A and B) linked by disulfide bonds, which is a well-established fact in biochemistry. Option c is incorrect because insulin promotes the uptake of potassium into cells, not the opposite. Option d is incorrect as well; the half-life of circulating insulin is approximately 4-6 minutes, although the duration of action for subcutaneous insulin can vary depending on the formulation. Based on this analysis, option b is the most accurate statement regarding insulin.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
