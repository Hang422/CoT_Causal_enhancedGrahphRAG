Drug implicated is?\n\n                    ### Options\n                    opa. Streptomycin\nopb. Isoniazid\nopc. Ethambutol\nopd. Rifampicin\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nIn evaluating the side effects of anti-tubercular drugs, Streptomycin is well-documented to cause ototoxicity, which can lead to symptoms such as deafness and tinnitus. This aligns with the retrieved evidence paths indicating Streptomycin's association with hearing-related complications. Isoniazid is primarily associated with neuropathy, not typically linked to hearing loss, making it an unlikely cause. Ethambutol is known for causing visual disturbances, not auditory issues, and Rifampicin is associated with hepatotoxicity rather than ototoxicity. Therefore, based on standard medical consensus and the relevant evidence, Streptomycin is the most likely drug implicated in causing deafness and tinnitus in this scenario.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The core medical principle here involves understanding the side effects associated with anti-tubercular drugs. Streptomycin is an aminoglycoside antibiotic known for its ototoxic effects, which can lead to symptoms such as deafness and tinnitus. This aligns with the enhanced information provided, which supports the consensus that Streptomycin is the most likely drug to cause these auditory side effects. Isoniazid, Ethambutol, and Rifampicin have different primary side effects, such as neuropathy, visual disturbances, and hepatotoxicity, respectively, and are not typically associated with ototoxicity. Therefore, based on standard medical knowledge and the enhanced information, Streptomycin is the most likely drug implicated in this scenario.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
