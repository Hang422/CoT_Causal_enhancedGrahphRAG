Cholestyramine\nopb. Thiazide diuretics\nopc. Quinidine\nopd. Amlodipine\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nDigoxin is known to have significant interactions with several drugs. Cholestyramine binds to digoxin in the gastrointestinal tract, reducing its absorption and thus its effectiveness, which is a significant interaction. Thiazide diuretics can lead to electrolyte imbalances, particularly hypokalemia, which increases the risk of digoxin toxicity, making this a significant interaction. Quinidine is well-documented to increase digoxin levels by reducing its clearance, leading to a higher risk of toxicity, which is a significant interaction. Amlodipine, a calcium channel blocker, does not significantly affect digoxin levels and is not known to have a significant interaction with digoxin. Therefore, the correct answer is that amlodipine does not have a significant interaction with digoxin.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "
