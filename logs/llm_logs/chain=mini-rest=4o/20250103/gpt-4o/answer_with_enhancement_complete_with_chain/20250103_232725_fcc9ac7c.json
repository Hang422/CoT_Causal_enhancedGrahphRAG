Fatty acids\nopb. Ketone bodies\nopc. Glucose\nopd. Any of the above\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nUnder normal conditions, the primary source of energy for cardiac muscle is fatty acids. This is supported by the fact that fatty acids are abundant in the bloodstream and undergo beta-oxidation to produce ATP, which aligns with standard biochemical consensus. While cardiac muscle can also utilize glucose and ketone bodies, these are secondary sources under normal conditions. Glucose is metabolized through glycolysis and the Krebs cycle to produce ATP, and ketone bodies can be used during fasting or low carbohydrate intake. The retrieved evidence paths confirm that both fatty acids and glucose are located in the myocardium and are involved in ATP production, supporting their roles in energy metabolism. However, the primary reliance on fatty acids is consistent with the heart's preference for this energy source under normal physiological conditions.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Under normal physiological conditions, cardiac muscle primarily relies on fatty acids as its main source of energy. Fatty acids are abundant in the bloodstream and are efficiently oxidized in the mitochondria of cardiac cells to produce ATP. This preference is due to the high energy yield from fatty acid oxidation, which is crucial for the continuous and high-energy demands of the heart. While glucose and ketone bodies can also be used as energy sources, they are typically secondary to fatty acids under normal conditions. The enhanced information aligns with the standard medical consensus that fatty acids are the primary energy source for cardiac muscle, confirming this understanding.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
