Family of three seven transmembrane protein\nopb. Activated by thrombin\nopc. Releases PGE2\nopd. Protects epithelial cells\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nProtease activated receptors (PARs) are a family of G protein-coupled receptors, consisting of PAR1, PAR2, and PAR3, each with seven transmembrane domains, confirming that they are a family of three seven transmembrane proteins. Thrombin is a well-known activator of PAR1, supporting the statement that they are activated by thrombin. While PARs can influence the release of various mediators, their primary role is not the direct release of PGE2, making the statement about releasing PGE2 likely false. PARs do play a role in cell signaling and can influence protective mechanisms in epithelial cells, but their primary function is not solely protective, making the statement about protecting epithelial cells somewhat ambiguous. Therefore, the statement about releasing PGE2 is the exception and likely false.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "
