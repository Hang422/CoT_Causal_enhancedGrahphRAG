Hypoglycemia\nopb. Cinchonism\nopc. Arrhythmias\nopd. Sweating\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nIntravenous administration of quinine is known to cause hypoglycemia, which can lead to symptoms such as restlessness and sweating. This aligns with the standard medical consensus that hypoglycemia is a common side effect of quinine, especially when administered intravenously. The retrieved evidence paths support the link between agitation (restlessness) and hypoglycemia, reinforcing this interpretation. While cinchonism is a known side effect of quinine, it typically presents with symptoms like tinnitus, headache, and dizziness, rather than restlessness and sweating. Arrhythmias are a possible but less common side effect of quinine and are not directly linked to the symptoms described. Therefore, the most likely cause of the patient's symptoms is hypoglycemia.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

Hypoglycemia can manifest with symptoms such as restlessness and sweating, which aligns with the patient's presentation. While cinchonism is another side effect of quinine, it typically involves symptoms like tinnitus, headache, and dizziness, which do not match the patient's symptoms.
