Three months ago he was diagnosed with hypeension, and placed on antihypeensive medication. Which of the following medications was most likely prescribed?\n\n                    ### Options\n                    opa. Captopril\nopb. Furosemide\nopc. Hydrochlorothiazide\nopd. Spironolactone\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nThe patient, a 52-year-old male, presents with gynecomastia after starting antihypertensive medication. Among the options, Spironolactone is the most likely cause of gynecomastia. This is supported by standard medical consensus, which recognizes Spironolactone, a potassium-sparing diuretic, as a common cause of breast tissue enlargement in males due to its anti-androgenic effects. The retrieved evidence paths confirm that Spironolactone can cause gynecomastia, aligning with the consensus that it is a known side effect. Other medications listed, such as Captopril, Furosemide, and Hydrochlorothiazide, are not typically associated with gynecomastia. Therefore, Spironolactone is the most likely medication prescribed that led to the patient's symptoms.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

Gynecomastia is a known side effect of certain medications, particularly those with anti-androgenic properties. Among the options provided, Spironolactone is a potassium-sparing diuretic that is well-documented to cause gynecomastia due to its anti-androgenic effects. This aligns with standard medical knowledge and consensus. The other medications listed, such as Captopril (an ACE inhibitor), Furosemide (a loop diuretic), and Hydrochlorothiazide (a thiazide diuretic), are not typically associated with gynecomastia. Therefore, based on the symptoms and the known side effects of the medications, Spironolactone is the most likely medication prescribed that led to the patient's symptoms.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
