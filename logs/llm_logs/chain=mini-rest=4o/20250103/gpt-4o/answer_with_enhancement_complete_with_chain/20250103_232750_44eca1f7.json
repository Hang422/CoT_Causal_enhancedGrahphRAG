Tamsulosin\nopb. Prazosin\nopc. Oxazocin\nopd. Dolazoline\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nTamsulosin is a selective alpha-1A adrenergic blocker that relaxes smooth muscle in the prostate, reducing urinary obstruction and improving urinary flow, providing symptomatic relief in BPH. This aligns with the consensus that alpha-1 blockers are effective in treating BPH symptoms. Prazosin, while an alpha-1 blocker, is less selective for the prostate and primarily causes vasodilation, making it less effective for BPH compared to Tamsulosin. Oxazocin is an alpha-1 blocker but is less commonly used and has unclear efficacy in BPH. Dolazoline, being an alpha-2 adrenergic agonist, is not used for BPH and is unlikely to provide symptomatic relief. The evidence paths confirm that urinary tract obstruction leads to lower urinary tract symptoms associated with BPH, supporting the role of alpha-1 blockers in symptom relief.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH) is a common condition in older men characterized by an enlarged prostate gland, leading to urinary symptoms. Alpha-1 adrenergic blockers are commonly used to provide symptomatic relief by relaxing the smooth muscle in the prostate and bladder neck, thereby improving urine flow. Tamsulosin is a selective alpha-1A adrenergic blocker, which specifically targets the receptors in the prostate, making it highly effective for BPH symptom relief. Prazosin, while an alpha-1 blocker, is less selective and primarily used for hypertension, making it less ideal for BPH. Oxazocin is not commonly used or well-documented for BPH treatment. Dolazoline, being an alpha-2 adrenergic agonist, is not relevant for BPH treatment. Based on the consensus and the enhanced information, Tamsulosin is the most appropriate choice for providing symptomatic relief in BPH.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
