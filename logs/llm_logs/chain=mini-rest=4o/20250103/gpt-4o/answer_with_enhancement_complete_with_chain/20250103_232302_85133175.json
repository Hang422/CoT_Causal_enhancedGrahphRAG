Bromocriptine\nopb. Levodopa\nopc. Amantadine\nopd. Metoclopramide\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nHyperprolactinemia is a side effect of metoclopramide. Metoclopramide is a dopamine antagonist, which leads to increased prolactin secretion, thereby causing hyperprolactinemia. This aligns with the consensus that dopamine antagonists can increase prolactin levels. The evidence paths support this by associating metoclopramide with dopamine antagonism. In contrast, bromocriptine is a dopamine agonist, which decreases prolactin secretion, making it unlikely to cause hyperprolactinemia. Levodopa, as a dopamine precursor, can increase dopamine levels and potentially decrease prolactin, while amantadine's effect on prolactin is unclear but generally not associated with hyperprolactinemia. Therefore, metoclopramide is the most likely cause of hyperprolactinemia among the options.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Hyperprolactinemia is a condition characterized by elevated levels of prolactin in the blood. It is commonly associated with the use of medications that antagonize dopamine receptors, as dopamine normally inhibits prolactin secretion. Metoclopramide is a well-known dopamine antagonist, which can lead to increased prolactin levels and thus cause hyperprolactinemia. In contrast, bromocriptine is a dopamine agonist and is actually used to treat hyperprolactinemia by reducing prolactin levels. Levodopa, a precursor to dopamine, and amantadine, which has dopaminergic activity, are not typically associated with causing hyperprolactinemia. Therefore, based on the pharmacological action of these drugs, metoclopramide is the most likely to cause hyperprolactinemia.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
