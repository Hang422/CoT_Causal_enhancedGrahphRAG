Nimodipine\nopb. Amlodipine\nopc. Diltiazem\nopd. Verapamil\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nNimodipine is the drug specifically indicated for the management of subarachnoid hemorrhage due to its ability to prevent cerebral vasospasm, a common and serious complication of this condition. This is supported by the evidence path showing Nimodipine's role in treating cerebral vasospasm. While Amlodipine, Diltiazem, and Verapamil are also calcium channel blockers, they are not specifically indicated for preventing vasospasm in subarachnoid hemorrhage and are less effective than Nimodipine for this purpose. The retrieved evidence paths confirm Nimodipine's interaction with factors associated with subarachnoid hemorrhage complications, further supporting its use in this context.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is a serious condition that can lead to cerebral vasospasm, a complication that can cause delayed cerebral ischemia. Nimodipine, a calcium channel blocker, is specifically indicated for the prevention of cerebral vasospasm following SAH. It is the only drug among the options provided that has a well-established role in this context. While other calcium channel blockers like Amlodipine, Diltiazem, and Verapamil are used for various cardiovascular conditions, they are not specifically indicated for SAH. The enhanced information supports the consensus that Nimodipine is the drug of choice for this condition due to its effectiveness in preventing vasospasm, which is a critical aspect of managing SAH.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
