Heparin sulfate\nopb. Protamine sulfate\nopc. Low molecular weight heparin\nopd. Warfarin\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nFor prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism in patients undergoing cancer surgery, low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) is the anticoagulant of choice. This is supported by clinical guidelines due to its efficacy and safety profile in this context. Heparin sulfate, while an anticoagulant, is typically used for immediate anticoagulation rather than prophylaxis, and is not the first choice in this scenario. Warfarin, although an anticoagulant, is not ideal for immediate post-surgical prophylaxis due to its delayed onset and need for monitoring. Protamine sulfate is not applicable as it is an antidote for heparin, not an anticoagulant. The retrieved evidence paths confirm that heparin and its derivatives are anticoagulants, but do not specifically address the prophylactic use in cancer surgery, thus supporting the consensus that LMWH is preferred.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"In the context of prophylaxis for venous thromboembolism in patients undergoing cancer surgery, the primary consideration is the balance between efficacy and safety. Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) is widely recommended in clinical guidelines for this purpose due to its favorable pharmacokinetic profile, which includes a predictable anticoagulant response, a lower risk of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, and no need for routine monitoring. Heparin sulfate is not typically used for prophylaxis in this setting, as it is more suited for immediate anticoagulation. Warfarin is not ideal due to its delayed onset and requirement for monitoring, making it unsuitable for immediate post-surgical prophylaxis. Protamine sulfate is not an anticoagulant but rather an antidote for heparin. Therefore, based on standard medical knowledge and enhanced information, LMWH is the anticoagulant of choice for prophylaxis in cancer surgery patients.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opc\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
