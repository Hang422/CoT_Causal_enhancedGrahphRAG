It is highly effective in the treatment of aspergillosis\nopb. It does not penetrate the blood-brain barrier\nopc. Its oral bioavailability is less than that of ketoconazole\nopd. It inhibits demethylation of lanosterol\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nFluconazole is an antifungal medication primarily effective against Candida species and not effective against Aspergillus species, making it not highly effective in the treatment of aspergillosis. It is known to penetrate the blood-brain barrier, allowing it to treat fungal infections in the central nervous system. Fluconazole has high oral bioavailability, which is greater than that of ketoconazole. It inhibits the enzyme lanosterol demethylase, which is involved in the synthesis of ergosterol, thus inhibiting the demethylation of lanosterol. The retrieved evidence supports fluconazole's effectiveness against Candida and its interaction with enzymes, aligning with the consensus that it inhibits lanosterol demethylation.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Fluconazole is an antifungal medication that is not effective against Aspergillus species, making option opa incorrect. It is known to penetrate the blood-brain barrier, which makes option opb incorrect. Fluconazole has high oral bioavailability, which is greater than that of ketoconazole, so option opc is incorrect. The mechanism of action of fluconazole involves the inhibition of the enzyme lanosterol demethylase, which is responsible for the demethylation of lanosterol in the synthesis of ergosterol, a key component of fungal cell membranes. This makes option opd the most accurate statement about fluconazole. The enhanced information aligns with the standard medical knowledge, confirming that fluconazole inhibits the demethylation of lanosterol.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
