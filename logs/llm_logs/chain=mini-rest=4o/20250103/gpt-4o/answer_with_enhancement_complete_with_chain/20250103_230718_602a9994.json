Atrial flutter\nopb. Parkinsonian tremor\nopc. Thyrotoxicosis\nopd. HOCM\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nPropranolol is a non-selective beta-blocker commonly used to manage cardiovascular conditions. It is effective in treating atrial flutter by controlling heart rate and reducing arrhythmias. In thyrotoxicosis, propranolol helps alleviate symptoms such as tachycardia due to its ability to reduce sympathetic nervous system activity. However, propranolol is not effective for Parkinsonian tremor, as it is not a dopaminergic agent and does not address the underlying pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease. While propranolol can be used in hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM) to reduce left ventricular outflow obstruction, it is not the primary treatment choice. Therefore, propranolol is useful in atrial flutter, thyrotoxicosis, and HOCM, but not in Parkinsonian tremor.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "
