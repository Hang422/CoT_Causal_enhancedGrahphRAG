Arachidonic acid\nopb. Cholesterol\nopc. Palmitic acid\nopd. Stearic acid\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nThe fluidity of the plasma membrane is influenced by the types of fatty acids present. Arachidonic acid, a polyunsaturated fatty acid, increases membrane fluidity due to its multiple double bonds, which introduce kinks in the fatty acid chains, preventing tight packing. This aligns with the consensus that unsaturated fatty acids enhance membrane fluidity. Cholesterol, while maintaining membrane integrity, can both increase and decrease fluidity depending on temperature and concentration, but generally acts to stabilize the membrane, preventing excessive fluidity. Palmitic acid and stearic acid are saturated fatty acids, which decrease membrane fluidity by allowing tighter packing of the lipid bilayer. The retrieved evidence paths confirm the presence of palmitic acid as a saturated fat, supporting its role in decreasing fluidity. Therefore, arachidonic acid is the most likely to increase membrane fluidity.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

Unsaturated fatty acids, such as arachidonic acid, increase membrane fluidity due to their multiple double bonds, which introduce kinks in the fatty acid chains and prevent tight packing. This is a well-established principle in physiology. Cholesterol can modulate membrane fluidity, but its effect is more complex and context-dependent, often acting to stabilize the membrane. Saturated fatty acids like palmitic acid and stearic acid decrease fluidity by allowing tighter packing of the lipid bilayer. Given this understanding, arachidonic acid is the most likely to increase membrane fluidity.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
