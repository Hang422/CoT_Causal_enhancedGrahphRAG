Alpha IEN\nopb. Beta IFN\nopc. Gamma IFN\nopd. Natalizumab\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nRelapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) requires disease-modifying therapies to manage the condition. Beta interferon (Beta IFN) is widely accepted as a first-line treatment for RRMS, as it reduces relapse rates and improves long-term outcomes, aligning with standard clinical guidelines. Natalizumab is effective for more severe cases of RRMS but is not typically used as a first-line treatment for all patients. Gamma interferon (Gamma IFN) is not commonly used for RRMS due to less evidence supporting its efficacy. The retrieved evidence paths, while broad, do not directly impact the consensus that Beta IFN is the standard of care for RRMS. Therefore, Beta IFN remains the drug of choice for relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) is a form of multiple sclerosis characterized by episodes of new or increasing neurological symptoms followed by periods of partial or complete recovery. The primary goal of treatment is to reduce the frequency and severity of relapses and to slow disease progression. Disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) are the cornerstone of RRMS management. Among the options provided, Beta interferon (Beta IFN) is widely recognized as a first-line treatment for RRMS. It has been shown to reduce relapse rates and delay the progression of disability. Natalizumab is also effective but is typically reserved for patients with more aggressive disease or those who do not respond to first-line therapies due to its risk profile, including the potential for progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). Gamma interferon is not used for RRMS as it can exacerbate the disease. Therefore, based on standard medical guidelines and consensus, Beta IFN is the drug of choice for relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
