Vitamin A\nopb. Vitamin C\nopc. Vitamin D\nopd. Vitamin B12\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nVitamin D is widely recognized for its role in enhancing insulin sensitivity, which can reduce the risk of insulin resistance, obesity, and metabolic syndrome. This aligns with evidence showing Vitamin D's involvement in improving insulin sensitivity and potentially reducing obesity-related risks. Vitamin C, while having antioxidant properties, lacks clear evidence directly linking it to reduced insulin resistance or metabolic syndrome. Vitamin A is primarily associated with immune function and does not have a direct impact on insulin resistance or obesity. Vitamin B12 is crucial for energy metabolism but does not have direct evidence supporting a role in reducing insulin resistance or metabolic syndrome. Therefore, Vitamin D is the most supported option for reducing the risk of insulin resistance, obesity, and metabolic syndrome.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "
