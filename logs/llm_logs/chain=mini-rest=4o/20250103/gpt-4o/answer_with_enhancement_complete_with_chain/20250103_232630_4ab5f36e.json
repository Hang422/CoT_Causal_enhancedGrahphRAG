Flutamide\nopb. Finasteride\nopc. Prazosin\nopd. Minoxidil\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nFinasteride is a 5α reductase inhibitor that effectively reduces dihydrotestosterone (DHT) levels, which is beneficial in treating both benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH) and male pattern baldness (androgenetic alopecia). This dual indication is supported by its mechanism of action, where inhibition of 5α reductase leads to decreased DHT, alleviating urinary symptoms in BPH and promoting hair regrowth in male pattern baldness. The retrieved evidence paths confirm Finasteride's role in treating androgenetic alopecia and its interaction with genetic factors associated with BPH, further supporting its efficacy in these conditions. Other options, such as Flutamide, Prazosin, and Minoxidil, do not share this dual indication, making Finasteride the correct choice.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The question asks for a 5α reductase inhibitor effective in both benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH) and male pattern baldness. Finasteride is well-documented in medical literature as a 5α reductase inhibitor that reduces dihydrotestosterone (DHT) levels. This reduction in DHT is beneficial for treating BPH by alleviating urinary symptoms and for treating male pattern baldness by promoting hair regrowth. The other options do not fit the criteria: Flutamide is an antiandrogen, Prazosin is an alpha-blocker, and Minoxidil is a vasodilator used topically for hair growth but not a 5α reductase inhibitor. Therefore, based on standard medical knowledge and the enhanced information provided, Finasteride is the most likely correct answer.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
