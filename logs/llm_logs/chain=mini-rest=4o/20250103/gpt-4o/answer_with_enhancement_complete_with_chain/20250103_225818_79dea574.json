Which of the following enzymes is defective?\n\n                    ### Options\n                    opa. Fructokinase\nopb. Aldolase A\nopc. Aldolase B\nopd. Sucrase\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nThe symptoms of vomiting, lethargy, and severe jaundice in a 6-month-old male baby after the introduction of fruit juice suggest a metabolic disorder related to fructose metabolism. The most likely condition is hereditary fructose intolerance, which is caused by a deficiency in the enzyme Aldolase B. This enzyme is crucial for the proper metabolism of fructose, and its deficiency leads to the accumulation of toxic metabolites, causing the observed symptoms. The retrieved evidence paths support the involvement of Aldolase B in fructose metabolism and its association with metabolic diseases, aligning with the consensus that Aldolase B deficiency is responsible for hereditary fructose intolerance. Other enzymes like Fructokinase, Aldolase A, and Sucrase are less likely to cause the severe symptoms observed in this case.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The symptoms of vomiting, lethargy, and severe jaundice in a 6-month-old male baby after the introduction of fruit juice are indicative of a metabolic disorder related to fructose metabolism. The most likely condition is hereditary fructose intolerance (HFI), which is caused by a deficiency in the enzyme Aldolase B. Aldolase B is responsible for the breakdown of fructose-1-phosphate into dihydroxyacetone phosphate and glyceraldehyde. In the absence of functional Aldolase B, fructose-1-phosphate accumulates, leading to toxic effects in the liver and kidneys, manifesting as the symptoms observed. Other enzymes listed, such as Fructokinase, Aldolase A, and Sucrase, are involved in different aspects of carbohydrate metabolism and are less likely to cause the specific symptoms associated with HFI. Therefore, based on standard medical knowledge and consensus, the defective enzyme in this scenario is Aldolase B.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opc\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
