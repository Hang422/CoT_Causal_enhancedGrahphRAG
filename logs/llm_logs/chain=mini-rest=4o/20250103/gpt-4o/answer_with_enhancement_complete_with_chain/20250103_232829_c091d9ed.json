Glucocoicoids\nopb. Mineralcoicoids\nopc. Aldosterone\nopd. Androgens\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nThe zona reticularis of the adrenal cortex primarily secretes androgens, such as dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA). This is consistent with the standard physiological understanding that the adrenal cortex is divided into three zones: the zona glomerulosa, which produces mineralocorticoids; the zona fasciculata, which produces glucocorticoids; and the zona reticularis, which produces androgens. The retrieved evidence paths support this by indicating that the zona reticularis is a location of androgens and dehydroepiandrosterone, confirming its role in androgen production. Therefore, the major hormone secreted by the zona reticularis is androgens.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

The zona glomerulosa primarily secretes mineralocorticoids, such as aldosterone. The zona fasciculata is responsible for the production of glucocorticoids, such as cortisol. The zona reticularis, the innermost layer of the adrenal cortex, primarily secretes androgens, including dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and androstenedione. This understanding is consistent with standard medical knowledge and is supported by the enhanced information provided. Therefore, the major hormone secreted by the zona reticularis is androgens.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
