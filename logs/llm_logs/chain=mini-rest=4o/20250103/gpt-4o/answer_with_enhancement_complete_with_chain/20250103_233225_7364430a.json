Leucine\nopb. Lysine\nopc. Methionine\nopd. Proline\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nEssential amino acids are those that cannot be synthesized by the human body and must be obtained through diet. According to standard biochemical consensus, leucine, lysine, and methionine are classified as essential amino acids because they are necessary for protein synthesis, growth, tissue repair, and metabolism, respectively. Proline, on the other hand, is classified as a non-essential amino acid because the body can synthesize it. Therefore, proline is the exception among the options provided. The retrieved evidence paths, while broad, confirm the interaction of leucine, lysine, and methionine with cells, supporting their roles as essential amino acids. Proline's classification as non-essential aligns with the consensus that it can be synthesized by the body, making it the correct answer to the question.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The core medical principle here is the classification of amino acids into essential and non-essential categories. Essential amino acids cannot be synthesized by the human body and must be obtained through diet. Leucine, lysine, and methionine are well-established as essential amino acids, as they play critical roles in protein synthesis and other metabolic processes. Proline, however, is classified as a non-essential amino acid because the body can synthesize it from other compounds. This classification is widely accepted in biochemistry, and there is no significant controversy or complexity surrounding it. Therefore, based on standard medical knowledge and consensus, proline is the exception among the options provided.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 100\n}\n```",
