Abciximab\nopb. Eptifibatide\nopc. Tirofiban\nopd. Prasugrel\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nGp2b3A inhibitors, also known as glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors, are a class of antiplatelet drugs that prevent platelet aggregation by blocking the Gp2b3A receptor on platelets. Abciximab, eptifibatide, and tirofiban are well-known examples of Gp2b3A inhibitors. Prasugrel, on the other hand, is a thienopyridine antiplatelet agent that works by irreversibly inhibiting the P2Y12 receptor on platelets, which is a different mechanism of action from Gp2b3A inhibitors. Therefore, prasugrel is not classified as a Gp2b3A inhibitor. The retrieved evidence paths, while broad, confirm that prasugrel interacts with different pathways and mechanisms than those associated with Gp2b3A inhibitors, supporting the consensus that prasugrel is not a Gp2b3A inhibitor.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "
