Interleukin-6\nopb. Interleukin-6 receptor\nopc. Interleukin-5\nopd. Interleukin-5 receptor\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nTocilizumab is a monoclonal antibody that specifically targets the Interleukin-6 receptor, not Interleukin-6 itself. This is consistent with its mechanism of action in treating rheumatoid arthritis, where it inhibits the signaling pathway of Interleukin-6, a cytokine involved in inflammation. The retrieved evidence supports this by showing interactions between tocilizumab and the Interleukin-6 receptor, as well as its use in treating autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis. Therefore, the correct target of tocilizumab is the Interleukin-6 receptor, aligning with standard medical consensus.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

It works by targeting the Interleukin-6 receptor, thereby inhibiting the signaling pathway of Interleukin-6, which is a cytokine involved in the inflammatory process. This mechanism of action is well-documented and aligns with the standard medical consensus. The enhanced information provided supports this understanding by confirming that tocilizumab specifically targets the Interleukin-6 receptor, not Interleukin-6 itself.
