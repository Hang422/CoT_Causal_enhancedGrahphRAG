It is more common with huminsulin\nopb. It may occur in the presence of infections\nopc. It may be due to antibodies to insulin\nopd. Use of glucocorticoids may be useful in severe cases\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nIn evaluating insulin resistance in diabetic patients, the following insights are aligned with medical consensus: (opb) Insulin resistance can occur during infections, as infections can exacerbate insulin resistance. (opc) Insulin resistance may be due to antibodies to insulin, although this is not common, it is a recognized possibility. (opd) The use of glucocorticoids is known to cause or worsen insulin resistance, making them not useful in severe cases of insulin resistance. The retrieved evidence path supports this by linking glucocorticoids to insulin resistance. (opa) The statement that insulin resistance is more common with human insulin is incorrect; human insulin is not more commonly associated with insulin resistance compared to other forms. Therefore, option (opa) is the exception and the correct answer to the question.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"In evaluating the statements regarding insulin resistance in diabetic patients, we need to identify the one that is incorrect. Option (opb) is true because infections can indeed exacerbate insulin resistance. Option (opc) is also true as antibodies to insulin can cause insulin resistance, although this is not very common. Option (opd) is incorrect because glucocorticoids are known to cause or worsen insulin resistance, not alleviate it, making them unsuitable for treating severe cases of insulin resistance. Option (opa) is incorrect because human insulin (huminsulin) is not more commonly associated with insulin resistance compared to other forms of insulin. Therefore, the statement that insulin resistance is more common with human insulin is false, making option (opa) the correct answer to the question. This aligns with the enhanced information provided, which supports the consensus that human insulin is not more commonly linked to insulin resistance.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
