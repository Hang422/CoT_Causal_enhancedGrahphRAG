Proximal tubule\nopb. Distal tubules\nopc. Loop of Henle\nopd. Collecting duct\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nAldosterone primarily acts on the distal tubules and collecting duct of the renal tubules. It increases sodium reabsorption and potassium excretion, which are key functions in regulating electrolyte balance and water retention. This action is facilitated by stimulating sodium-potassium ATPase activity, enhancing sodium reabsorption. The retrieved evidence paths, while broad, support the role of aldosterone in influencing renal tubule structure and excretory function, which are associated with electrolyte management. Therefore, the consensus is that aldosterone's primary site of action is the distal tubules and collecting duct, aligning with the corrected reasoning chains.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Aldosterone is a hormone that plays a crucial role in regulating sodium and potassium levels in the body. It primarily acts on the distal tubules and the collecting duct of the nephron in the kidneys. The hormone increases sodium reabsorption and potassium excretion, which helps in maintaining electrolyte balance and blood pressure. The enhanced information aligns with standard medical knowledge, confirming that aldosterone's primary sites of action are the distal tubules and collecting duct. Therefore, the most likely correct options are opb (Distal tubules) and opd (Collecting duct). Given the question format, if only one option is to be selected, the distal tubules are often emphasized in educational contexts as a primary site of action.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
