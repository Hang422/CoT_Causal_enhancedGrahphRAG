Acute renal failure\nopb. Development of antiplatelet antibodies\nopc. Encephalitis secondary to liver dysfunction\nopd. Hemorrhagic stroke\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nFibrinolytic drugs, used in the treatment of acute myocardial infarction, work by dissolving thrombi and restoring blood flow. However, this mechanism increases the risk of bleeding, particularly systemic bleeding, which can lead to hemorrhagic events. The most significant adverse effect associated with fibrinolytic therapy is hemorrhagic stroke, due to the increased risk of intracranial hemorrhage. This is supported by the consensus that fibrinolytic agents alter hemostasis, leading to a higher bleeding tendency. The retrieved evidence paths confirm that hemorrhage can lead to hemorrhagic stroke, aligning with the consensus that the primary concern with fibrinolytic therapy is the risk of bleeding complications, particularly intracranial hemorrhage resulting in hemorrhagic stroke. Other options, such as acute renal failure, development of antiplatelet antibodies, and encephalitis secondary to liver dysfunction, are not commonly associated with fibrinolytic therapy.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Fibrinolytic drugs, such as tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), are used to dissolve clots in the treatment of acute myocardial infarction. The primary mechanism of these drugs is to enhance the breakdown of fibrin, which can lead to systemic bleeding. The most significant and well-documented adverse effect of fibrinolytic therapy is the risk of bleeding, particularly intracranial hemorrhage, which can result in a hemorrhagic stroke. This is a well-known risk associated with the use of fibrinolytics, and it aligns with the consensus in medical literature. Other options, such as acute renal failure, development of antiplatelet antibodies, and encephalitis secondary to liver dysfunction, are not typically associated with fibrinolytic therapy. Therefore, the most likely adverse effect to occur with the use of fibrinolytic drugs in this context is hemorrhagic stroke.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
