Allopurinol\nopb. Probenecid\nopc. Indomethacin\nopd. Aspirin\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nProbenecid is a uricosuric drug because it inhibits the renal tubular reabsorption of uric acid, leading to increased uric acid excretion. This aligns with the standard consensus that uricosuric drugs promote the excretion of uric acid. Allopurinol, on the other hand, is not a uricosuric drug; it works by inhibiting xanthine oxidase, thereby reducing uric acid production. Indomethacin is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug and does not have uricosuric properties. Aspirin, particularly at low doses, can inhibit uric acid excretion, which is contrary to the action of uricosuric drugs. The retrieved evidence paths related to aspirin's effects on excretory function are too broad and do not directly support its classification as a uricosuric drug.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The question asks for the identification of a uricosuric drug. Uricosuric drugs are those that increase the excretion of uric acid in the urine, thereby lowering blood uric acid levels. Probenecid is well-known for its uricosuric properties as it inhibits the renal tubular reabsorption of uric acid, leading to increased excretion. Allopurinol, while used in the management of gout, is not uricosuric; it reduces uric acid production by inhibiting xanthine oxidase. Indomethacin is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) and does not have uricosuric effects. Aspirin, especially at low doses, can actually decrease uric acid excretion, which is opposite to the action of uricosuric drugs. Therefore, based on standard medical knowledge and the enhanced information provided, Probenecid is the correct answer.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
