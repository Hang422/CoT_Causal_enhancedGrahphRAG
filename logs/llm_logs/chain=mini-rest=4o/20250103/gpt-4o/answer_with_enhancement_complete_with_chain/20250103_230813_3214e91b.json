INH\nopb. Erythromycin estolate\nopc. Pyrazinamide\nopd. Ethionamide\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nErythromycin estolate is well-documented to cause cholestatic jaundice by inhibiting bile flow, leading to increased bilirubin levels. This aligns with the consensus that erythromycin estolate is a common cause of cholestatic jaundice. INH (Isoniazid) is associated with hepatotoxicity and can cause jaundice, but it is not primarily cholestatic in nature. Pyrazinamide and Ethionamide can cause liver dysfunction and jaundice, but they are not specifically linked to cholestatic jaundice. The retrieved evidence paths for Pyrazinamide and Ethionamide focus on liver dysfunction in general and do not specifically address cholestatic jaundice, thus are not directly relevant to the question. Therefore, erythromycin estolate is the most likely cause of cholestatic jaundice among the options provided.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "
