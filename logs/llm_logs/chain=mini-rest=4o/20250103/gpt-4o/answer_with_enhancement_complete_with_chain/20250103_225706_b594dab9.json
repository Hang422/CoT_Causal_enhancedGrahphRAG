Ethanolamine oleate\nopb. Octreotide\nopc. Propanolol\nopd. Phytonadione\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nThe drug of choice for bleeding oesophageal varices is octreotide. Octreotide is a vasoactive drug that reduces portal pressure and splanchnic blood flow, effectively controlling bleeding in acute variceal hemorrhage. This aligns with standard medical consensus and is supported by evidence paths indicating octreotide's role in treating acute hemorrhage and its association with portal hypertension management. Ethanolamine oleate is used for sclerotherapy but is not first-line for acute bleeding. Propranolol is a beta-blocker used for prevention, not acute management, of variceal bleeding. Phytonadione (vitamin K) is used for coagulopathy and is not specific for variceal bleeding. Therefore, octreotide is the most appropriate choice for acute management of bleeding oesophageal varices.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"In the management of bleeding oesophageal varices, the primary goal is to control the acute hemorrhage and reduce portal hypertension. Octreotide, a somatostatin analogue, is widely recognized for its ability to decrease splanchnic blood flow and portal pressure, making it effective in controlling acute variceal bleeding. Ethanolamine oleate is used for sclerotherapy, which is a procedure rather than a pharmacological first-line treatment for acute bleeding. Propranolol is a non-selective beta-blocker used for the prevention of variceal bleeding by reducing portal pressure, but it is not suitable for acute management. Phytonadione (vitamin K) is used to correct coagulopathy but does not directly address variceal bleeding. Therefore, based on standard medical knowledge and consensus, octreotide is the drug of choice for acute management of bleeding oesophageal varices.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
