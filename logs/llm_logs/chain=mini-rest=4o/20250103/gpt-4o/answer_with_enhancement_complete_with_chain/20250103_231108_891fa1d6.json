Morphine\nopb. Dextromethorphan\nopc. Diphenhydramine\nopd. Aprepitant\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nDextromethorphan is an NMDA receptor antagonist, which is known to increase the risk of dissociative effects, including hallucinations. This is supported by its mechanism of action involving NMDA receptor antagonism, which is associated with such effects. Diphenhydramine, due to its anticholinergic properties, can cause CNS effects like confusion, but hallucinations are less common and typically occur at high doses. Morphine, as an opioid receptor agonist, can alter mental status and potentially cause hallucinations, but this is more related to its sedative effects rather than a direct hallucinogenic property. Aprepitant, a substance P/neurokinin 1 receptor antagonist, is not commonly associated with hallucinations. Therefore, dextromethorphan is the most likely antitussive to cause hallucinations based on its pharmacological profile.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "
