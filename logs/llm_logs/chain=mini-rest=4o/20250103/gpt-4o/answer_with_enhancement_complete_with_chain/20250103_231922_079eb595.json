Pyrazinamide\nopb. Isoniazid\nopc. Ethambutol\nopd. Rifampicin\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nIn a HIV positive patient on zidovudine, lamivudine, and indinavir therapy who develops TB, Rifampicin should be avoided. Rifampicin is a potent inducer of CYP450 enzymes, which can significantly reduce the plasma levels of zidovudine and indinavir, leading to decreased efficacy of HIV treatment and potential treatment failure. This interaction is well-documented and aligns with standard medical consensus. Other anti-tubercular drugs like Isoniazid, Ethambutol, and Pyrazinamide do not have such significant interactions with the mentioned HIV medications, making them safer options in this context. The retrieved evidence paths, while broad, support the understanding that drug interactions involving CYP450 and zidovudine are critical considerations in this scenario.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"In the context of a HIV positive patient on zidovudine, lamivudine, and indinavir therapy who develops TB, the primary concern is drug interactions that could compromise the efficacy of the HIV treatment. Rifampicin is known to be a potent inducer of the cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzyme system, which can significantly reduce the plasma levels of both zidovudine and indinavir. This reduction can lead to subtherapeutic levels of these antiretroviral drugs, potentially resulting in treatment failure and the development of drug resistance. The other anti-tubercular drugs listed, such as Isoniazid, Ethambutol, and Pyrazinamide, do not have such significant interactions with the mentioned HIV medications. Therefore, based on standard medical knowledge and consensus, Rifampicin should be avoided in this scenario to prevent these adverse interactions.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
