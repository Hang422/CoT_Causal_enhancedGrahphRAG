Blood viscosity is increased in anemia\nopb. Blood viscosity is decreased in polycythemia\nopc. Cardiac output is increased in anemia\nopd. Cardiac output is decreased in Beri-Beri\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nIn circulatory biomechanics, the following consensus-aligned facts are relevant: In anemia, there is a decreased red blood cell count, which leads to decreased blood viscosity. This reduction in viscosity can result in increased cardiac output as a compensatory mechanism to maintain adequate tissue perfusion. Therefore, the statement 'Cardiac output is increased in anemia' is true. In polycythemia, the increased red blood cell count leads to increased blood viscosity, which can potentially decrease cardiac output due to increased resistance in blood flow, contradicting the statement 'Blood viscosity is decreased in polycythemia.' In Beri-Beri, cardiovascular function is impaired, but typically, cardiac output is increased due to vasodilation and high-output heart failure, contradicting the statement 'Cardiac output is decreased in Beri-Beri.' The retrieved evidence paths, while broad, support the relationship between red blood cell count and blood viscosity, confirming the consensus that changes in red blood cell count affect blood viscosity and subsequently cardiac output.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"In circulatory biomechanics, the relationship between blood viscosity, red blood cell count, and cardiac output is well-established. Anemia, characterized by a decreased red blood cell count, leads to reduced blood viscosity. This reduction in viscosity can result in increased cardiac output as the body compensates to maintain adequate tissue perfusion. Therefore, the statement 'Cardiac output is increased in anemia' is true. Conversely, in polycythemia, the increased red blood cell count results in higher blood viscosity, not decreased, which can increase resistance to blood flow. In Beri-Beri, cardiac output is typically increased due to vasodilation and high-output heart failure, not decreased. Thus, the most accurate statement based on standard medical knowledge is that cardiac output is increased in anemia.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opc\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
