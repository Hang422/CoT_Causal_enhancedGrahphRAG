Mannitol\nopb. Spironolactone\nopc. Furosemide\nopd. Hydrochlorothiazide\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nMannitol is an osmotic diuretic that increases intravascular volume, which can exacerbate cardiac failure, making it contraindicated in such cases. Spironolactone, a potassium-sparing diuretic, is used in heart failure to reduce mortality and is not contraindicated. Furosemide, a loop diuretic, is commonly used to manage fluid overload in heart failure, aligning with standard treatment practices. Hydrochlorothiazide, a thiazide diuretic, is not typically first-line for heart failure but may be used cautiously. The evidence paths confirm that potassium-sparing diuretics and thiazide diuretics can treat heart failure, while mannitol's role as an osmotic diuretic supports its contraindication in cardiac failure due to potential volume overload.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"In the context of cardiac failure, the primary concern with diuretic use is managing fluid overload without exacerbating the condition. Mannitol, an osmotic diuretic, works by drawing fluid into the vascular space, which can increase intravascular volume and potentially worsen cardiac failure. This makes it contraindicated in such cases. Spironolactone, furosemide, and hydrochlorothiazide are all used in managing heart failure, with furosemide being a common choice for reducing fluid overload. Spironolactone is beneficial for its mortality-reducing effects in heart failure, and hydrochlorothiazide can be used cautiously. Therefore, based on standard medical knowledge and the enhanced information provided, mannitol is the diuretic contraindicated in the presence of cardiac failure.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
