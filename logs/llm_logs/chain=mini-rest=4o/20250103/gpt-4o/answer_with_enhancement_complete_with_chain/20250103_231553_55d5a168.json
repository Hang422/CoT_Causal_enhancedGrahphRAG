Spectrin\nopb. Ankyrin\nopc. Tubulin\nopd. Laminin\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nThe plasma membrane is anchored to the cytoskeleton primarily through the interaction of spectrin and ankyrin. Spectrin is a cytoskeletal protein that provides structural support by forming a meshwork beneath the plasma membrane. Ankyrin acts as an anchoring protein that connects spectrin to the membrane, facilitating the linkage between the plasma membrane and the cytoskeleton. Tubulin, while a component of microtubules, does not directly anchor the plasma membrane to the cytoskeleton. Laminin is part of the extracellular matrix and does not play a role in binding the plasma membrane to the cytoskeleton. The evidence paths support the interaction between ankyrin and spectrin, confirming their roles in membrane-cytoskeleton linkage.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "
