Cinchonism\nopb. Hyperglycemia\nopc. Hypoglycemia\nopd. Hypokalemia\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nQuinine is known to cause a condition called cinchonism, which is characterized by symptoms such as sweating and palpitation. This aligns with the standard medical consensus that quinine can stimulate the central nervous system and affect the cardiovascular system, leading to these symptoms. The retrieved evidence paths, while broad, support the understanding that quinine affects blood circulation, which can manifest as cardiovascular symptoms. Therefore, the most likely cause of the patient's symptoms of sweating and palpitation after quinine administration is cinchonism.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Quinine is an antimalarial drug that can cause a range of side effects, one of which is cinchonism. Cinchonism is a well-documented condition associated with quinine use and includes symptoms such as tinnitus, headache, nausea, dizziness, and disturbances in vision and hearing. Importantly, it can also cause cardiovascular symptoms like sweating and palpitations due to its effects on the central nervous system and cardiovascular system. While hypoglycemia is a known side effect of quinine, it typically presents with symptoms like confusion, shakiness, and weakness, rather than sweating and palpitations alone. Hypokalemia and hyperglycemia are less commonly associated with quinine and do not align as closely with the symptoms described. Therefore, the most likely cause of the patient's symptoms of sweating and palpitation after quinine administration is cinchonism.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}",
