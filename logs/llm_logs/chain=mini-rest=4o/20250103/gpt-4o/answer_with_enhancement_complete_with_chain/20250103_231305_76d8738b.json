None of the above\nopb. Albumin\nopc. Globulins\nopd. Chylomicrons\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nFree fatty acids are transported in the bloodstream primarily by binding to albumin, a major transport protein. This is a well-established consensus in biochemistry. Albumin facilitates the delivery of free fatty acids to tissues, including the mitochondria, where they undergo oxidation. The retrieved evidence paths support this by showing albumin's interaction with cells and its presence in blood circulation, which aligns with its role in transporting free fatty acids. Other proteins like globulins and chylomicrons are not primarily involved in the transport of free fatty acids to mitochondria for oxidation. Therefore, the correct answer is that free fatty acids are transported by albumin.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"In the context of free fatty acid transport for oxidation in the mitochondria, the primary transport mechanism involves binding to albumin in the bloodstream. Albumin is a well-known transport protein that facilitates the delivery of free fatty acids to various tissues, including those where mitochondrial oxidation occurs. While globulins and chylomicrons are involved in lipid transport, they do not primarily transport free fatty acids to mitochondria. Chylomicrons are more involved in the transport of dietary lipids from the intestines, and globulins have different roles in the body. Therefore, based on standard medical knowledge and consensus, albumin is the correct answer.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
