Streptomycin\nopb. Ethambutol\nopc. Capreomycin\nopd. Rifampicin\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nIn severe renal failure, the choice of antitubercular drugs must consider renal excretion and potential toxicity. Streptomycin is primarily excreted by the kidneys, leading to accumulation and increased risk of toxicity in renal failure, making it unsafe. Ethambutol is partially renally excreted, requiring dose adjustment, and can be used with caution. Capreomycin is also excreted by the kidneys and poses a risk of nephrotoxicity, thus not recommended. Rifampicin is primarily metabolized by the liver with minimal renal excretion, making it generally safe for use in severe renal failure. Therefore, Rifampicin is the safest option among the listed drugs for patients with severe renal failure.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "
