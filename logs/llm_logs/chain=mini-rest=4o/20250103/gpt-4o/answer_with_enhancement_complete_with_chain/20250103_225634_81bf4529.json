Patient gives history of recurrent bacterial infections. Ophthalmic examination reveals white triangular plaques on conjunctiva. This patient is suffering from deficiency of:\n\n                    ### Options\n                    opa. Vitamin D\nopb. Vitamin B\nopc. Vitamin A\nopd. Vitamin C\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nThe patient's symptoms of diminished night vision, dryness of eyes, and recurrent bacterial infections strongly suggest a Vitamin A deficiency. Night blindness is a classic symptom of Vitamin A deficiency, as Vitamin A is crucial for the formation of rhodopsin, a pigment in the retina that is essential for low-light vision. The dryness of eyes and presence of white triangular plaques on the conjunctiva, known as Bitot's spots, are indicative of xerophthalmia, which is directly linked to Vitamin A deficiency. Additionally, Vitamin A plays a significant role in maintaining immune function, and its deficiency can lead to increased susceptibility to infections. The retrieved evidence paths support these points by linking night blindness, xerophthalmia, and immune dysfunction to Vitamin A deficiency. Therefore, the most likely deficiency in this patient is Vitamin A.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "
