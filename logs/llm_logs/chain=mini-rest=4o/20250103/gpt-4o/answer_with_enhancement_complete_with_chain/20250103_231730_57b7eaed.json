Monotherapy for acute episodes\nopb. Monitoring of serum concentration is not useful for guiding dose adjustment\nopc. Can result in leucocytosis\nopd. Can result in hypehyroidism on long term use\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nLithium is commonly used in the treatment of bipolar disorder, particularly effective for acute manic episodes, but it is not typically used as monotherapy for these episodes due to the need for additional mood stabilization. Monitoring of serum lithium concentration is crucial for guiding dose adjustments to ensure efficacy and prevent toxicity, aligning with standard medical practice. Lithium can cause leucocytosis, which is a recognized but not frequently reported side effect. Long-term use of lithium is more commonly associated with hypothyroidism rather than hyperthyroidism, as supported by evidence linking lithium to thyroid dysfunction, particularly hypothyroidism.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Lithium is a well-established treatment for bipolar disorder, particularly effective in managing manic episodes and as a long-term mood stabilizer. However, it is not typically used as monotherapy for acute manic episodes due to the need for rapid stabilization, often requiring additional medications. Monitoring serum lithium levels is crucial for dose adjustment to prevent toxicity and ensure therapeutic efficacy, making option opb incorrect. Lithium is known to cause leucocytosis, which is a recognized side effect, making option opc correct. Long-term use of lithium is more commonly associated with hypothyroidism rather than hyperthyroidism, making option opd incorrect. Therefore, the most accurate statement regarding lithium use in manic-depressive psychosis is that it can result in leucocytosis.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opc\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
