Single dose in ascariasis\nopb. Immunostimulant\nopc. Paralysis of worms by depolarisation\nopd. Immunodepressant in high doses\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nLevamisole is primarily used as an anthelmintic for treating ascariasis, often effective with a single dose, which aligns with standard medical consensus. It acts as an immunostimulant by enhancing the immune response, but it is not typically used as an immunodepressant. Although high doses of levamisole can lead to immunosuppression, this is not its primary indication. The mechanism of action involves causing paralysis of worms through depolarization, which is effective against certain helminths. The retrieved evidence supports its use in treating ascariasis and its role in modulating immune responses, but does not support its use as an immunodepressant. Therefore, the correct answer is that levamisole is not used as an immunodepressant in high doses.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

It is also known to act as an immunostimulant, enhancing the immune response, aligning with option 'opb'. The mechanism of action involves causing paralysis of worms through depolarization, which supports option 'opc'. While high doses of levamisole can lead to immunosuppression as a side effect, it is not used therapeutically as an immunodepressant, making option 'opd' the correct choice for what levamisole is not used for. Therefore, the most likely correct answer is that levamisole is not used as an immunodepressant in high doses.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
