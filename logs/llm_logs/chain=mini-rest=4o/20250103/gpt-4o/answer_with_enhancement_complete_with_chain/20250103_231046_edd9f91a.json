Osteoporosis\nopb. Endometrial hyperplasia\nopc. Ovarian cancer\nopd. Decreased triglyceride level\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nTamoxifen is a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) that exhibits both estrogenic and anti-estrogenic effects depending on the tissue. It is well-documented to increase the risk of endometrial hyperplasia due to its partial estrogen agonist effects on the endometrial tissue, as supported by the evidence path showing the interaction with estrogens and the location of endometrial hyperplasia in endometrial tissue. While tamoxifen can affect lipid metabolism, the impact on triglyceride levels is not consistently clear or significant. The suggestion that tamoxifen causes osteoporosis is not strongly supported, as it is more commonly associated with maintaining bone density due to its estrogenic effects on bone. The link between tamoxifen and ovarian cancer is not well-established, and the reasoning chain suggesting a risk is speculative. Therefore, the most consensus-aligned effect of tamoxifen is the increased risk of endometrial hyperplasia.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "
