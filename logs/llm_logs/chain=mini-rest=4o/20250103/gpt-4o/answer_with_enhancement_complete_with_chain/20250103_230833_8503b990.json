Can be used in absence seizures\nopb. Can be mixed with saline\nopc. Can be given orally\nopd. It is the drug of choice for myoclonic seizures\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nFosphenytoin is a prodrug of phenytoin, designed to be more soluble and easier to administer intravenously. It can be mixed with saline, unlike phenytoin, which is not typically mixed with saline due to precipitation issues. This makes option 'opb' correct. Fosphenytoin is not available in oral form, so option 'opc' is incorrect. Both fosphenytoin and phenytoin are not used for absence seizures, making option 'opa' incorrect. Neither fosphenytoin nor phenytoin is the drug of choice for myoclonic seizures, so option 'opd' is also incorrect. The retrieved evidence paths do not directly address the key points about fosphenytoin's administration or its use in specific types of seizures, so they are not incorporated into the final reasoning.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Fosphenytoin is a prodrug of phenytoin, designed to improve solubility and ease of administration, particularly intravenously. One of the key differences between fosphenytoin and phenytoin is that fosphenytoin can be mixed with saline, which is not typically recommended for phenytoin due to the risk of precipitation. This makes option 'opb' correct. Fosphenytoin is not available in oral form, so option 'opc' is incorrect. Both fosphenytoin and phenytoin are not used for absence seizures, making option 'opa' incorrect. Neither fosphenytoin nor phenytoin is the drug of choice for myoclonic seizures, so option 'opd' is also incorrect. Therefore, the most likely correct answer, based on the consensus and known pharmacological properties, is that fosphenytoin can be mixed with saline.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
