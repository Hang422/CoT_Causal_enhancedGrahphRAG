Erythromycin\nopb. Benzene hexachloride\nopc. Piperazine\nopd. Thiabendazole\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nScabies is caused by the mite Sarcoptes scabiei and requires treatment to eliminate the infestation. The standard treatment for scabies involves topical insecticides or antiparasitic agents. Benzene hexachloride, also known as Lindane, is a topical insecticide that is effective against scabies, aligning with the consensus and supported by the evidence path indicating Lindane treats scabies. Erythromycin is an antibiotic and is not effective against mite infestations, as antibiotics target bacterial infections, not parasitic infestations. Piperazine is an anthelmintic used for treating worm infections, not scabies, and the evidence paths incorrectly associate it with scabies treatment. Thiabendazole is primarily an antifungal agent and is not typically used for scabies treatment, despite the evidence path suggesting it treats scabies. Therefore, the most consensus-aligned treatment for scabies among the options is Benzene hexachloride (Lindane).\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "
