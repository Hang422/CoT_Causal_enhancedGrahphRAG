Cough suppression\nopb. Anti-emesis\nopc. Miosis\nopd. Truncal rigidity\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nOpioids are known to have several pharmacological actions. They are effective in suppressing cough, which aligns with their use in cough suppression. Opioids also cause miosis, or pupil constriction, which is a well-documented effect. Truncal rigidity is another recognized pharmacological action of opioids, particularly at high doses or with certain potent opioids. However, opioids are not primarily used for anti-emesis; in fact, they often cause nausea and vomiting, which contradicts the claim of anti-emetic properties. The evidence paths confirm the association of opioids with nausea and miosis, supporting the consensus that anti-emesis is not a pharmacological action of opioids. Therefore, the correct answer is that anti-emesis is not a pharmacological action of opioids.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "
