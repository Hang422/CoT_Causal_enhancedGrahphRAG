Ascaris\nopb. Filariasis\nopc. Malaria\nopd. Oncocerciasis\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nIvermectin is an antiparasitic medication indicated for certain parasitic infections. It is effective and approved for use in treating Onchocerciasis and Filariasis, as supported by the evidence path (Ivermectin)-TREATS->(Onchocerciasis). Ivermectin is also effective against Ascaris infections. However, it is not effective against Malaria, which is caused by Plasmodium species, and requires different treatment. The retrieved evidence paths confirm that Ivermectin treats parasitic diseases but do not support its use for Malaria. Therefore, the correct answer is that Ivermectin is not indicated for Malaria.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Ivermectin is an antiparasitic medication that is widely used for the treatment of certain parasitic infections. It is indicated for Onchocerciasis (river blindness) and Filariasis, both of which are caused by parasitic worms. Ivermectin is also effective against Ascaris, a type of roundworm infection. However, Malaria is caused by Plasmodium species, which are protozoan parasites, and is not treated with Ivermectin. The standard treatment for Malaria involves antimalarial drugs such as chloroquine, artemisinin-based combination therapies, or other specific antimalarials. Therefore, based on standard medical knowledge and the enhanced information provided, Ivermectin is not indicated for the treatment of Malaria.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opc\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
