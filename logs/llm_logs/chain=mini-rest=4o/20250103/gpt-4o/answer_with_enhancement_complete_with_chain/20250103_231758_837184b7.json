ENL\nopb. HIV neuropathy\nopc. HIV associated ulcer\nopd. Behcet's syndrome\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nThalidomide is effectively used for Erythema Nodosum Leprosum (ENL) and Behcet's syndrome due to its anti-inflammatory properties. It is not indicated for HIV neuropathy, as there is limited evidence supporting its efficacy in this condition. Similarly, thalidomide is not used for HIV-associated ulcers, as there is no established benefit. The retrieved evidence path suggests thalidomide's role in preventing symptoms related to neuropathy, but this does not align with the consensus that it is not effective for HIV neuropathy. Therefore, the correct answer is that thalidomide is used in all except HIV neuropathy.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "
