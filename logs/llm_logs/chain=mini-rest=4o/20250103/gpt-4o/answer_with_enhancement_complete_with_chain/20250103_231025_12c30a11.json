Krabbe's disease\nopb. Fabry's disease\nopc. Fragile syndrome\nopd. All\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nGlycogen storage diseases are characterized by abnormal glycogen metabolism and enzyme deficiencies affecting glycogen synthesis or breakdown. Krabbe's disease is a lysosomal storage disorder, not a glycogen storage disease. Fabry's disease is a sphingolipidosis, unrelated to glycogen metabolism, and thus not a glycogen storage disease. Fragile X syndrome is a genetic condition affecting the FMR1 gene, not related to glycogen storage. Therefore, none of the options (Krabbe's disease, Fabry's disease, Fragile X syndrome) are classified as glycogen storage diseases. The evidence paths provided do not directly support any of these conditions being glycogen storage diseases, confirming the consensus that all options are not glycogen storage diseases.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "
