Fever\nopb. Peptic ulcer\nopc. Unstable angina\nopd. Myalgia\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nAspirin is contraindicated in peptic ulcer due to its ability to inhibit platelet aggregation and cause gastrointestinal irritation, both of which increase the risk of bleeding and can exacerbate ulcers. This aligns with the consensus that aspirin should be avoided in patients with peptic ulcers. Aspirin is not contraindicated in myalgia, as it is often used to reduce inflammation and pain. It is also not contraindicated in unstable angina, where it is beneficial for cardiovascular protection. However, aspirin is contraindicated in children with fever due to the risk of Reye's syndrome, a serious condition that can occur when aspirin is used in viral infections in children. The evidence paths support the contraindication in peptic ulcer and the risk of Reye's syndrome in children with fever, confirming the consensus understanding.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

This is a well-established contraindication in medical practice. While aspirin is beneficial in conditions like unstable angina for its antiplatelet effects, and it is used to relieve pain in myalgia, it is not contraindicated in these conditions. Additionally, aspirin is contraindicated in children with fever due to the risk of Reye's syndrome, but the question does not specify age, so the most direct contraindication among the options provided is peptic ulcer.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
