Magnesium hydroxide\nopb. Magnesium hydroxide and calcium carbonate\nopc. Magnesium hydroxide and Aluminium hydroxide\nopd. Calcium carbonate and aluminium hydroxide\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nMagaldrate is an antacid that, when it reacts with gastric acid, is converted into magnesium hydroxide and aluminum hydroxide. This reaction helps neutralize stomach acid, which aligns with standard pharmacological consensus. The retrieved evidence path, while broad, supports the role of antacids like magaldrate in treating conditions such as duodenal ulcers by neutralizing gastric acid. Therefore, the correct conversion of magaldrate in the presence of gastric acid is to magnesium hydroxide and aluminum hydroxide, as supported by the consensus and relevant evidence.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "
