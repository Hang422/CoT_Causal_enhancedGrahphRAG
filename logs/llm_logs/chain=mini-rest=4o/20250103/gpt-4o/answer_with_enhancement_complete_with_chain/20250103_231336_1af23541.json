Carbamazepine\nopb. Vigabatrin\nopc. Sodium valproate\nopd. Lamotrigine\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nCarbamazepine, sodium valproate, and lamotrigine are all indicated for the treatment of bipolar disorder, as they are effective in mood stabilization and maintenance treatment. Vigabatrin, however, is primarily used for the treatment of epilepsy and is not indicated for bipolar disorder. The retrieved evidence paths suggest that Vigabatrin can complicate mood disorders, which aligns with the consensus that it is not used for bipolar disorder treatment. Therefore, Vigabatrin is the exception among the listed drugs.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

Carbamazepine, sodium valproate, and lamotrigine are well-established in the management of bipolar disorder due to their mood-stabilizing properties. Vigabatrin, on the other hand, is primarily used for epilepsy and is not indicated for bipolar disorder.
