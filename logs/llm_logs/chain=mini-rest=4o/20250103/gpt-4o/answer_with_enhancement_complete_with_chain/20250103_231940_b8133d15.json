Striated\nopb. Large T tubules\nopc. Troponin system present\nopd. Caldesmon is impoant regulatory protein\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nCardiac muscle is characterized by striations due to the presence of sarcomeres, which are essential for its contraction mechanism. Large T tubules are present in cardiac muscle and play a crucial role in facilitating calcium entry, which is vital for excitation-contraction coupling. The troponin system is a key component in cardiac muscle contraction, interacting with myocytes to regulate this process. Caldesmon, however, is primarily associated with smooth muscle and is not a significant regulatory protein in cardiac muscle. Therefore, the exception among the features listed is that caldesmon is an important regulatory protein in cardiac muscle, which is incorrect.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Cardiac muscle is known for its striated appearance due to the presence of sarcomeres, which are the repeating units responsible for muscle contraction. This aligns with option 'opa' being a feature of cardiac muscle. Large T tubules are indeed present in cardiac muscle, facilitating the rapid transmission of electrical signals and calcium ions, which supports option 'opb'. The troponin system is crucial in cardiac muscle contraction, as it regulates the interaction between actin and myosin, confirming option 'opc' as a feature. Caldesmon, however, is primarily associated with smooth muscle and not cardiac muscle, making option 'opd' the exception. Therefore, the feature that does not belong to cardiac muscle is the presence of caldesmon as an important regulatory protein.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
