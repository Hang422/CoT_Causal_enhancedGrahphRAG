Anti depressants\nopb. Anti psychotics\nopc. Anti epileptics\nopd. Mood stabilizers\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nSchizophrenia is primarily characterized by psychotic symptoms, which are effectively managed with antipsychotic medications. This aligns with the standard medical consensus that antipsychotics are the first-line treatment for schizophrenia. While mood disturbances and comorbid conditions like depression may occur in schizophrenia, mood stabilizers and antidepressants are not primary treatments for the disorder. Antiepileptics are not standard treatments for schizophrenia, although they may be considered in cases where seizures are present. The retrieved evidence paths confirm that schizophrenia causes psychotic symptoms, supporting the use of antipsychotics as the primary treatment. Other paths related to mood disturbances and seizures are relevant but do not alter the consensus that antipsychotics are the preferred treatment.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

The standard medical treatment for managing these symptoms is the use of antipsychotic medications. Antidepressants, mood stabilizers, and antiepileptics are not considered primary treatments for schizophrenia. While mood disturbances and comorbid conditions like depression may occur in individuals with schizophrenia, these are typically addressed as secondary concerns and do not alter the primary treatment approach. Antiepileptics are not standard treatments for schizophrenia unless there is a specific indication such as comorbid epilepsy. Therefore, based on the consensus in medical practice, antipsychotics are the first-line treatment for schizophrenia.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
