Proprioception\nopb. Vibratory sense\nopc. Heat sensation\nopd. Touch\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nThe dorsal column of the spinal cord is primarily responsible for carrying sensory modalities such as proprioception, vibratory sense, and fine touch. It does not carry heat sensation, which is transmitted via the spinothalamic tract. All reasoning chains correctly identify that the dorsal column does not carry heat sensation, aligning with standard medical consensus. The retrieved evidence paths do not directly address the sensory modalities of the dorsal column and are therefore not relevant to the question. Thus, the correct answer is that heat sensation is not carried in the dorsal column.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The dorsal column of the spinal cord is responsible for transmitting sensory information related to proprioception, vibratory sense, and fine touch. These modalities are carried by the fasciculus gracilis and fasciculus cuneatus within the dorsal column. Heat sensation, on the other hand, is transmitted via the spinothalamic tract, which is separate from the dorsal column. Therefore, based on standard medical knowledge, heat sensation is not carried in the dorsal column. This aligns with the consensus that the dorsal column does not transmit temperature-related sensory information.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opc\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
