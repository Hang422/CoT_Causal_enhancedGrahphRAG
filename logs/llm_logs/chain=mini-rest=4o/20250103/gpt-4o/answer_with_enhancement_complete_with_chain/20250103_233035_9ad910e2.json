Directly simulated by fall in PaO2\nopb. Connected with cardiac center\nopc. Inhibited during swallowing\nopd. Situated in midbrain\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nThe respiratory center is primarily located in the medulla oblongata and pons, not the midbrain, and is responsible for regulating breathing by monitoring blood gases such as CO2 and O2. It is not directly stimulated by a fall in PaO2; rather, it is more sensitive to changes in PaCO2 and pH levels. The respiratory center is connected with the cardiac center, allowing coordination between respiratory and cardiac functions. During swallowing, the respiratory center is inhibited to prevent aspiration, aligning with reflex actions. The retrieved evidence paths broadly confirm the involvement of the medulla and pons in respiratory functions but do not directly address the specific mechanisms of respiratory center stimulation or inhibition.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The respiratory center is primarily located in the medulla oblongata and pons, not the midbrain, which rules out option opd. It is more sensitive to changes in PaCO2 and pH rather than directly stimulated by a fall in PaO2, eliminating option opa. The respiratory center is connected with the cardiac center, allowing for coordination between respiratory and cardiac functions, supporting option opb. During swallowing, the respiratory center is inhibited to prevent aspiration, which aligns with option opc. Both options opb and opc are correct based on standard medical knowledge. However, since the question asks for what is 'true regarding the respiratory center,' and considering the context of the question, option opc is more directly related to the function of the respiratory center itself rather than its connections.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opc\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}",
