Increased blood pressure caused by nicotine\nopb. Increased skeletal muscle strength caused by neostigmine, an acetycholine esterase inhibitor\nopc. Bradycardia caused by infusion of acetylcholine\nopd. All of these\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nAtropine is a muscarinic receptor blocker, which means it can block the effects of acetylcholine on muscarinic receptors. This includes preventing bradycardia caused by acetylcholine, as bradycardia is mediated through muscarinic receptors in the heart. Atropine does not affect nicotinic receptors, so it cannot block the increased blood pressure caused by nicotine, which acts on nicotinic receptors. Similarly, atropine does not block the effects of neostigmine on skeletal muscle strength, as neostigmine increases acetylcholine levels that act on nicotinic receptors at the neuromuscular junction. Therefore, only the bradycardia caused by acetylcholine can be blocked by atropine. The retrieved evidence paths do not directly address the specific pharmacological actions of atropine, nicotine, or neostigmine in this context, so they are not incorporated into the final reasoning.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Atropine is a muscarinic receptor antagonist, meaning it blocks the effects of acetylcholine on muscarinic receptors. Acetylcholine can cause bradycardia through its action on muscarinic receptors in the heart, and atropine can block this effect, preventing bradycardia. Nicotine increases blood pressure by acting on nicotinic receptors, which are not affected by atropine. Neostigmine increases skeletal muscle strength by inhibiting acetylcholine esterase, leading to increased acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junction, which acts on nicotinic receptors. Atropine does not block nicotinic receptors, so it cannot prevent the effects of neostigmine. Therefore, atropine can only block the bradycardia caused by acetylcholine, not the effects mediated by nicotinic receptors.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opc\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
