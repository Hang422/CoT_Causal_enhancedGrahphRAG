Androgen binding protein\nopb. Testosterone\nopc. LH\nopd. FSH\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nSertoli cells are known to produce androgen-binding protein (ABP), which binds testosterone and supports spermatogenesis, aligning with the consensus that ABP is crucial for maintaining high testosterone levels in the seminiferous tubules (Option opa). Sertoli cells are stimulated by follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), which promotes spermatogenesis, but they do not directly influence testosterone levels; instead, they create an environment conducive to spermatogenesis (Option opd). Sertoli cells respond to testosterone, which supports spermatogenesis, and this interaction is crucial for the production of ABP, confirming the role of testosterone in Sertoli cell function (Option opb). The role of Sertoli cells in influencing luteinizing hormone (LH) secretion is not direct; LH primarily acts on Leydig cells to stimulate testosterone production, and Sertoli cells do not have a direct feedback mechanism on LH (Option opc). The evidence paths confirm the interaction of testosterone with Sertoli cells and the role of ABP in binding testosterone, supporting the consensus understanding of Sertoli cell function in spermatogenesis.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Sertoli cells are specialized cells in the testes that play a crucial role in supporting spermatogenesis. They are known to secrete androgen-binding protein (ABP), which binds to testosterone and helps maintain high concentrations of testosterone in the seminiferous tubules, essential for the development of sperm. This aligns with the consensus understanding that ABP is a key product of Sertoli cells. While Sertoli cells are influenced by FSH, which stimulates their function, they do not secrete FSH themselves. Similarly, testosterone is produced by Leydig cells, not Sertoli cells, and LH primarily acts on Leydig cells to stimulate testosterone production. Therefore, the most likely correct answer, based on standard medical knowledge, is that Sertoli cells secrete androgen-binding protein.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
