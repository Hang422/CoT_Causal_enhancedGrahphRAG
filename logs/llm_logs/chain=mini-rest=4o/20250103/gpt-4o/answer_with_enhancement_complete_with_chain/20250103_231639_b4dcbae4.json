Xylose\nopb. Mannose\nopc. Glucose\nopd. Ribose\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nGlucose is the only sugar normally absorbed in the intestine against a concentration gradient. This is due to its active transport mechanism via the sodium-glucose transport protein (SGLT1), which allows glucose to be absorbed even when its concentration is higher inside the intestinal cells than in the lumen. This process is well-supported by the consensus in physiology and is crucial for efficient glucose uptake. The retrieved evidence paths, while broad, confirm the role of glucose in intestinal metabolism and its active transport process. In contrast, xylose, mannose, and ribose are not absorbed against a concentration gradient. Xylose is absorbed passively, mannose is absorbed via specific transporters but not primarily against a gradient, and ribose is not a major sugar absorbed in the intestine. Therefore, glucose is the correct answer.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The absorption of sugars in the intestine can occur via passive or active transport mechanisms. Glucose is unique among the common dietary sugars because it is absorbed against a concentration gradient through an active transport mechanism. This process involves the sodium-glucose transport protein (SGLT1), which uses the sodium gradient established by the Na+/K+ ATPase pump to facilitate glucose uptake into the intestinal cells. This mechanism allows glucose to be absorbed even when its concentration is higher inside the cells than in the intestinal lumen. In contrast, other sugars like xylose, mannose, and ribose do not utilize this active transport mechanism to move against a concentration gradient. Xylose is absorbed passively, mannose is absorbed via specific transporters but not against a gradient, and ribose is not a major sugar absorbed in the intestine. Therefore, based on standard physiological knowledge and consensus, glucose is the only sugar normally absorbed in the intestine against a concentration gradient.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opc\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
