Aromatase\nopb. 5 alpha reductase\nopc. Desmolase\nopd. Isomerase\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nAromatase is the enzyme responsible for converting androgens to estrogens in the growing ovarian follicle. This conversion is crucial for follicular development and is well-supported by biochemical consensus. Aromatase specifically catalyzes the aromatization of androgens into estrogens, a process that is essential in the ovarian follicle. The retrieved evidence paths confirm that aromatase interacts with estrogens, supporting its role in this conversion. Other enzymes like 5 alpha reductase, desmolase, and isomerase do not participate in this specific reaction: 5 alpha reductase is involved in converting testosterone to dihydrotestosterone, desmolase is involved in the initial steps of steroidogenesis, and isomerase catalyzes structural rearrangements unrelated to androgen to estrogen conversion. Therefore, aromatase is the correct enzyme associated with this process.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "
