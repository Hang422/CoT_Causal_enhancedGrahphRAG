      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Triamterene causes\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Better glucose tolerance\nopb. Muscle cramps\nopc. Decrease in urea level\nopd. Hypokalemia\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Triamterene\" -> \"potassium-sparing diuretic\" -> \"inhibition of sodium reabsorption\" -> \"retention of potassium\" -> \"possible hyperkalemia\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Triamterene\" -> \"increased urine output\" -> \"loss of electrolytes\" -> \"possible muscle cramps\" -> 75%\nCHAIN: \"Triamterene\" -> \"decreased sodium reabsorption\" -> \"decreased blood volume\" -> \"possible decrease in urea level\" -> 70%\nCHAIN: \"Triamterene\" -> \"potassium-sparing diuretic\" -> \"retention of potassium\" -> \"not associated with hypokalemia\" -> 90%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Triamterene)-ISA->(Potassium Sparing Diuretics)\n(potassium)-CAUSES->(Hypertensive disease)-CAUSES->(hyperkalemia)\n(potassium)-TREATS->(Kidney Diseases)-CAUSES->(hyperkalemia)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Triamterene is a potassium-sparing diuretic, which means it inhibits sodium reabsorption in the kidneys and leads to the retention of potassium. This mechanism is associated with the risk of hyperkalemia, not hypokalemia, as confirmed by the evidence path linking potassium-sparing diuretics to hyperkalemia. Therefore, option 'opd' (Hypokalemia) is incorrect. While triamterene can increase urine output, it is less likely to cause significant electrolyte loss leading to muscle cramps compared to other diuretics, making option 'opb' (Muscle cramps) less likely. The effect of triamterene on glucose tolerance and urea levels is not well-documented or significant, making options 'opa' (Better glucose tolerance) and 'opc' (Decrease in urea level) unlikely. The most consensus-aligned effect of triamterene is the potential for hyperkalemia due to potassium retention.\"\n}\n```",
