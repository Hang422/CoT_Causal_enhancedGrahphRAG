      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Which of the following drug is used in this test?\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Tolazoline\nopb. Clonidine\nopc. Bismuth\nopd. Oxymetazoline\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Clonidine\" -> \"alpha-2 adrenergic agonist\" -> \"used in hypertension management\" -> \"not typically used in this test\" -> 70%\nCHAIN: \"Tolazoline\" -> \"alpha-adrenergic antagonist\" -> \"used in certain vascular conditions\" -> \"not commonly used in this test\" -> 60%\nCHAIN: \"Oxymetazoline\" -> \"topical decongestant\" -> \"used for nasal congestion\" -> \"commonly used in this test\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Bismuth\" -> \"antidiarrheal and gastric protectant\" -> \"not related to the test\" -> \"not used in this context\" -> 50%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(bismuth)-TREATS->(Bacteria)-LOCATION_OF->(Polysaccharides)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Antidiarrheals)\n(Antidiarrheals)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Glucocorticoids)-PART_OF->(Epithelium)-LOCATION_OF->(Laboratory Procedures)\n(Tolazoline)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Pressors)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Adrenergic alpha-Antagonists)\n(bismuth)-TREATS->(Bacteria)-LOCATION_OF->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Antidiarrheals)\n(Tolazoline)-TREATS->(Hypoxia)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(KLK3 gene|KLK3)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Adrenergic alpha-Antagonists)\n(Antidiarrheals)-INTERACTS_WITH->(ADRBK1 gene|GRK2)-PART_OF->(Bone Marrow)-LOCATION_OF->(Laboratory Procedures)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Oxymetazoline is a topical decongestant commonly used in tests related to nasal congestion, aligning with its known pharmacological use. Clonidine, an alpha-2 adrenergic agonist, is primarily used for hypertension management and is not typically used in this context. Tolazoline, an alpha-adrenergic antagonist, is used in certain vascular conditions but is not commonly associated with this test. Bismuth, an antidiarrheal and gastric protectant, is unrelated to the test in question. The evidence paths provided do not directly support the use of any drug in a specific test context, but they confirm the general pharmacological roles of the drugs mentioned. Therefore, Oxymetazoline is the most likely drug used in the test based on its common application in nasal congestion scenarios.\"\n}\n```",
