      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        All of the following are true about loop diuretics except:\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. They are called as \"high ceiling\" diuretics\nopb. They act on Na+.K+.2Cl- symporter\nopc. They can cause hyperuricemia\nopd. Loop diuretics lead to hypercalcemia and hypomagnesimia\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: Loop diuretics are known as \"high ceiling\" diuretics -> They inhibit the Na+.K+.2Cl- symporter in the loop of Henle -> They can lead to increased uric acid levels -> They typically cause hypocalcemia and hypomagnesemia -> Therefore, the statement about causing hypercalcemia is incorrect -> 85%\nCHAIN: Loop diuretics are classified as \"high ceiling\" diuretics -> They act on the Na+.K+.2Cl- symporter in the renal tubules -> They can cause elevated uric acid levels, known as hyperuricemia -> They usually result in hypocalcemia and hypomagnesemia -> The claim that they lead to hypercalcemia is false -> 90%\nCHAIN: Loop diuretics are referred to as \"high ceiling\" diuretics -> Their mechanism involves blocking the Na+.K+.2Cl- symporter -> They are associated with hyperuricemia due to increased uric acid reabsorption -> They generally cause hypocalcemia and hypomagnesemia -> The assertion that they cause hypercalcemia is not supported -> 80%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Loop Diuretics)-CAUSES->(Excretory function)-PROCESS_OF->(Renal tubule structure)\n(Diuretics)-CAUSES->(Excretory function)-PROCESS_OF->(Renal tubule structure)\n(Renal tubule structure)-LOCATION_OF->(Disease)-CAUSES/MANIFESTATION_OF->(Hyperuricemia)\n(Hypomagnesemia)-CAUSES->(Syndrome)-CAUSES->(Hypercalcemia)\n(Hypomagnesemia)-CAUSES->(Adverse effects)-CAUSES->(Hypercalcemia)\n(Hypomagnesemia)-CAUSES->(Kidney Failure, Acute)-COMPLICATES->(Hypercalcemia)\n(Hypocalcemia)-CAUSES->(Disease)-CAUSES->(Hypercalcemia)\n(Hypocalcemia)-CAUSES->(Symptoms)-CAUSES->(Hypercalcemia)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Loop diuretics are known as 'high ceiling' diuretics because they can cause a significant increase in urine output. They act by inhibiting the Na+.K+.2Cl- symporter in the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle, which is consistent with standard pharmacological understanding. This action can lead to increased excretion of sodium, potassium, and chloride, and is associated with hypocalcemia and hypomagnesemia, not hypercalcemia. Loop diuretics can also cause hyperuricemia due to increased reabsorption of uric acid. Therefore, the statement that loop diuretics lead to hypercalcemia is incorrect. The retrieved evidence paths broadly support the role of loop diuretics in affecting renal excretory function and their association with hypomagnesemia and hypocalcemia, but do not directly support the incorrect claim of hypercalcemia.\"\n}\n```",
