      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Physiology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Testosterone production is mainly contributed by\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Leydig cells\nopb. Seolie cells\nopc. Seminiferous tubules\nopd. Epididymis\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Testosterone is produced in the testes\" -> \"Leydig cells are located in the interstitial space of the testes\" -> \"Leydig cells are responsible for testosterone synthesis\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Testosterone is a steroid hormone\" -> \"Steroid hormones are primarily produced by specific cells\" -> \"Leydig cells are the primary source of testosterone in males\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Testosterone is essential for male reproductive function\" -> \"Leydig cells produce testosterone in response to LH stimulation\" -> \"Leydig cells are the main contributors to testosterone production\" -> 92%\nCHAIN: \"Sertoli cells support spermatogenesis\" -> \"Sertoli cells do not produce testosterone\" -> \"Leydig cells are the primary source of testosterone\" -> 88%\nCHAIN: \"Seminiferous tubules are involved in sperm production\" -> \"Seminiferous tubules contain Sertoli cells\" -> \"Sertoli cells do not produce testosterone\" -> \"Leydig cells are the main source of testosterone\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Epididymis is involved in sperm maturation\" -> \"Epididymis does not produce hormones\" -> \"Leydig cells are responsible for testosterone production\" -> 90%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Structure of interstitial cell of Leydig)-LOCATION_OF->(Testosterone)\n(Testosterone)-INTERACTS_WITH/PART_OF->(Structure of interstitial cell of Leydig)\n(Epididymis)-LOCATION_OF->(Testosterone)\n(Inferior Colliculus)-LOCATION_OF->(Testosterone)\n(Cells)-INTERACTS_WITH/LOCATION_OF->(Testosterone)\n(Structure of sertoli cell)-INTERACTS_WITH/LOCATION_OF->(Testosterone)\n(Testosterone)-CAUSES->(Excretory function)-PROCESS_OF->(Inferior Colliculus)\n(Testosterone)-CAUSES->(Metabolic Rates)-PROCESS_OF->(Inferior Colliculus)\n(Testosterone)-CAUSES->(biological adaptation to stress)-PROCESS_OF->(Inferior Colliculus)\n(Testosterone)-CAUSES->(Functional disorder)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(GLUCOSE TOLERANCE)-PROCESS_OF->(Cells)\n(Testosterone)-CAUSES->(Diabetes)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(GLUCOSE TOLERANCE)-PROCESS_OF->(Cells)\n(Testosterone)-TREATS->(impaired glucose tolerance)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(GLUCOSE TOLERANCE)-PROCESS_OF->(Cells)\n(Steroid hormone)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Testosterone)\n(Hormones)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Testosterone)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Testosterone production in males is primarily attributed to Leydig cells, which are located in the interstitial space of the testes. These cells synthesize testosterone in response to luteinizing hormone (LH) stimulation. The consensus in physiology supports that Leydig cells are the main contributors to testosterone production, as they are specialized for this function. Sertoli cells, found within the seminiferous tubules, support spermatogenesis but do not produce testosterone. The epididymis is involved in sperm maturation and does not produce hormones. The retrieved evidence paths confirm the association of Leydig cells with testosterone production, reinforcing the consensus that Leydig cells are the primary source of testosterone in males.\"\n}\n```",
