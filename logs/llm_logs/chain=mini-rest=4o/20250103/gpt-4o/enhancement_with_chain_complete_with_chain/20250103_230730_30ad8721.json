      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Topical immunomodulator used for the treatment of genital was is:\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Imiquimod\nopb. Podophylline\nopc. Interferon\nopd. Acyclovir\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Topical immunomodulator\" -> \"used for treating genital warts\" -> \"Imiquimod is a topical immunomodulator\" -> \"Imiquimod is indicated for genital warts\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Topical treatments for genital warts\" -> \"include immunomodulators\" -> \"Podophylline is a topical treatment\" -> \"but not an immunomodulator\" -> \"Acyclovir is an antiviral\" -> \"Interferon is not typically used topically\" -> \"Imiquimod is the correct option\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Genital warts treatment options\" -> \"Imiquimod is a topical agent\" -> \"acts as an immunomodulator\" -> \"Podophylline is a cytotoxic agent\" -> \"Acyclovir is for viral infections\" -> \"Interferon is not a topical immunomodulator\" -> \"Imiquimod is the best choice\" -> 85%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Acyclovir)-TREATS->(Complication)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Interferons)\n(Acyclovir)-TREATS->(Abnormal renal function)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Interferons)\n(Interferons)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Macrophages, Peritoneal)-LOCATION_OF->(imiquimod)\n(Antiviral Agents)-CAUSES/PREVENTS->(Complication)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Interferons)\n(imiquimod)-TREATS->(Disease)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Immunity)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Immunologic Adjuvants)\n(imiquimod)-TREATS->(Disease)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Antiinflammatory Effect)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Immunologic Adjuvants)\n(Anogenital venereal warts)-CAUSES->(Obstruction)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(neuropeptide Y|NPY)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Macrophages, Peritoneal)-LOCATION_OF->(imiquimod)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Imiquimod is a topical immunomodulator that is specifically indicated for the treatment of genital warts. It works by stimulating the immune system to fight the human papillomavirus (HPV) that causes these warts. Podophylline, while used topically for genital warts, is a cytotoxic agent and not an immunomodulator. Acyclovir is an antiviral medication used primarily for herpes infections, not for genital warts. Interferons are not typically used as topical treatments for genital warts. The evidence paths confirm that imiquimod is associated with immunologic adjuvants and anti-inflammatory effects, supporting its role as an immunomodulator in treating conditions like genital warts. Therefore, Imiquimod is the correct choice for a topical immunomodulator used in the treatment of genital warts.\"\n}\n```",
