      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Hyperprolactinemia is a side effect of\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Bromocriptine\nopb. Levodopa\nopc. Amantadine\nopd. Metoclopramide\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Bromocriptine\" -> \"dopamine agonist\" -> \"decreased prolactin secretion\" -> \"not a cause of hyperprolactinemia\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Levodopa\" -> \"dopamine precursor\" -> \"increased dopamine levels\" -> \"possible decrease in prolactin\" -> 80%\nCHAIN: \"Amantadine\" -> \"antiviral and dopaminergic effects\" -> \"possible increase in dopamine\" -> \"unclear effect on prolactin\" -> 70%\nCHAIN: \"Metoclopramide\" -> \"dopamine antagonist\" -> \"increased prolactin secretion\" -> \"causes hyperprolactinemia\" -> 90%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Metoclopramide)-TREATS->(Functional disorder)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(physiological aspects)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Dopamine Antagonists)\n(Metoclopramide)-TREATS->(Epilepsy)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(physiological aspects)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Dopamine Antagonists)\n(Bromocriptine)-ISA->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Dopamine)\n(Dopamine)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Prolactin)\n(Dopamine)-PART_OF->(Cells)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Prolactin)\n(Dopamine Hydrochloride)-TREATS->(Migraine Disorders)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Vasodilation)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Dopamine)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Hyperprolactinemia is a side effect of metoclopramide. Metoclopramide is a dopamine antagonist, which leads to increased prolactin secretion, thereby causing hyperprolactinemia. This aligns with the consensus that dopamine antagonists can increase prolactin levels. The evidence paths support this by associating metoclopramide with dopamine antagonism. In contrast, bromocriptine is a dopamine agonist, which decreases prolactin secretion, making it unlikely to cause hyperprolactinemia. Levodopa, as a dopamine precursor, can increase dopamine levels and potentially decrease prolactin, while amantadine's effect on prolactin is unclear but generally not associated with hyperprolactinemia. Therefore, metoclopramide is the most likely cause of hyperprolactinemia among the options.\"\n}\n```",
