      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Quinine given to a patient of falciparum malaria caused sweating and palpitation, the likely cause is?\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Cinchonism\nopb. Hyperglycemia\nopc. Hypoglycemia\nopd. Hypokalemia\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Quinine administration\" -> \"increased levels of quinine in the bloodstream\" -> \"stimulation of the central nervous system\" -> \"sweating and palpitation\" -> \"likely due to cinchonism\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Quinine given to treat malaria\" -> \"possible side effects include cinchonism\" -> \"cinchonism characterized by sweating and palpitation\" -> \"sweating and palpitation observed\" -> \"likely cause is cinchonism\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Quinine can cause adverse effects\" -> \"sweating and palpitation noted in the patient\" -> \"cinchonism is a known effect of quinine\" -> \"sweating and palpitation likely due to cinchonism\" -> 80%\nCHAIN: \"Quinine affects the cardiovascular system\" -> \"can lead to symptoms like palpitation\" -> \"sweating may also occur\" -> \"cinchonism is a possible explanation\" -> 75%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Quinine)-TREATS->(Disease)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Blood Circulation)\n(Quinine)-TREATS->(Infection)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Blood Circulation)\n(Quinine)-ISA->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-PART_OF->(Cells)-PART_OF->(Extracellular Matrix)-LOCATION_OF->(Stimulation procedure)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Quinine is known to cause a condition called cinchonism, which is characterized by symptoms such as sweating and palpitation. This aligns with the standard medical consensus that quinine can stimulate the central nervous system and affect the cardiovascular system, leading to these symptoms. The retrieved evidence paths, while broad, support the understanding that quinine affects blood circulation, which can manifest as cardiovascular symptoms. Therefore, the most likely cause of the patient's symptoms of sweating and palpitation after quinine administration is cinchonism.\"\n}\n```",
