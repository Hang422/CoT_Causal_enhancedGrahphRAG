      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Drug of choice for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder is:-\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Haloperidol\nopb. Imipramine\nopc. Alprazolam\nopd. Methylphenidate\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) treatment guidelines\" -> \"Stimulant medications are first-line treatments\" -> \"Methylphenidate is a commonly used stimulant\" -> \"Methylphenidate improves attention and reduces hyperactivity\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms\" -> \"Need for effective management options\" -> \"Methylphenidate is FDA-approved for ADHD\" -> \"Methylphenidate is widely prescribed\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Haloperidol is an antipsychotic\" -> \"Not typically used for ADHD\" -> \"Imipramine is a tricyclic antidepressant\" -> \"Not first-line for ADHD\" -> \"Alprazolam is a benzodiazepine\" -> \"Not indicated for ADHD\" -> \"Methylphenidate is the preferred choice\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Methylphenidate is a central nervous system stimulant\" -> \"Effective in increasing attention span\" -> \"Reduces impulsivity in ADHD patients\" -> \"Recommended by clinical guidelines\" -> 92%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Brain activity)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Methylphenidate)\n(Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(physiological aspects)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Methylphenidate)\n(Imipramine)-TREATS->(Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder)\n(Haloperidol)-TREATS->(Disease)-COMPLICATES->(Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder)\n(Haloperidol)-PREVENTS->(Symptoms)-PREDISPOSES->(Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder)\n(Haloperidol)-TREATS->(Sleep disturbances)-PREDISPOSES->(Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder)\n(Alprazolam)-TREATS->(Seizures)-CAUSES->(Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder)\n(Alprazolam)-TREATS->(Disease)-COMPLICATES->(Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder)\n(Alprazolam)-TREATS->(Obesity)-PREDISPOSES->(Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder)\n(Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Brain activity)-PROCESS_OF->(Cerebral cortex)-LOCATION_OF->(Imipramine)\n(Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Brain activity)-PROCESS_OF->(Brain)-LOCATION_OF->(Imipramine)\n(Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Brain activity)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Benzodiazepines)\n(Benzodiazepines)-PREDISPOSES->(Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder)\n(Methylphenidate)-TREATS->(Disease)-PREDISPOSES->(Hyperactive behavior)\n(Methylphenidate)-TREATS->(Pain)-PREDISPOSES->(Hyperactive behavior)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"The drug of choice for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is methylphenidate. Standard medical consensus and treatment guidelines indicate that stimulant medications, such as methylphenidate, are the first-line treatment for ADHD due to their effectiveness in improving attention and reducing hyperactivity and impulsivity. Methylphenidate is FDA-approved for ADHD and is widely prescribed, aligning with clinical guidelines. The retrieved evidence paths support this by showing methylphenidate's interaction with brain activity associated with ADHD. Other options, such as haloperidol, imipramine, and alprazolam, are not first-line treatments for ADHD. Haloperidol is an antipsychotic, imipramine is a tricyclic antidepressant, and alprazolam is a benzodiazepine, none of which are typically indicated for ADHD management.\"\n}\n```",
