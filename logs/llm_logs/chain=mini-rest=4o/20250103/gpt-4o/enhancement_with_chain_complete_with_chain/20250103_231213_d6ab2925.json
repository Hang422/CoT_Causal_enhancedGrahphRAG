      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Drug the choice for hyperthyroidism in first trimester of pregnancy is\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Methimazole\nopb. Propylthiouraril\nopc. Carbimazole\nopd. Perchlorate\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Hyperthyroidism treatment in pregnancy\" -> \"First trimester is critical for fetal development\" -> \"Certain drugs are safer than others\" -> \"Propylthiouracil is preferred in early pregnancy\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Hyperthyroidism management options\" -> \"Methimazole is associated with teratogenic effects\" -> \"Carbimazole is a pro-drug of Methimazole\" -> \"Perchlorate is not commonly used\" -> \"Propylthiouracil is the safest choice\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"First trimester hyperthyroidism treatment\" -> \"Risk of fetal harm must be minimized\" -> \"Propylthiouracil has a better safety profile\" -> \"Other options are less favorable\" -> \"Propylthiouracil is the drug of choice\" -> 92%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Corticosterone)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Propylthiouracil)\n(Teratogenesis)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Genes)-INTERACTS_WITH->(CYP2B6)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Methimazole)\n(Teratogenesis)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Genes)-INTERACTS_WITH->(TBX1)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Methimazole)\n(Hyperthyroidism)-PREDISPOSES->(Teratogenesis)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"In the treatment of hyperthyroidism during the first trimester of pregnancy, Propylthiouracil (PTU) is the preferred drug due to its better safety profile compared to Methimazole and Carbimazole. Methimazole is associated with teratogenic effects, particularly in the first trimester, and Carbimazole, being a pro-drug of Methimazole, shares these risks. Perchlorate is not commonly used for this indication. The retrieved evidence supports the teratogenic risks associated with Methimazole, reinforcing the consensus that PTU is the safer choice during early pregnancy to minimize fetal harm.\"\n}\n```",
