      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Which of the following antitussive can lead to hallucinations\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Morphine\nopb. Dextromethorphan\nopc. Diphenhydramine\nopd. Aprepitant\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Dextromethorphan\" -> \"NMDA receptor antagonist\" -> \"increased risk of dissociative effects\" -> \"possible hallucinations\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Diphenhydramine\" -> \"anticholinergic properties\" -> \"CNS effects including confusion\" -> \"possible hallucinations\" -> 80%\nCHAIN: \"Morphine\" -> \"opioid receptor agonist\" -> \"CNS depression\" -> \"possible altered mental status\" -> \"possible hallucinations\" -> 70%\nCHAIN: \"Aprepitant\" -> \"substance P/neurokinin 1 receptor antagonist\" -> \"not commonly associated with hallucinations\" -> \"unlikely to cause hallucinations\" -> 20%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Diphenhydramine)-ISA->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Anticholinergic Agents)\n(Morphine)-INTERACTS_WITH/ISA->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Opioids)\n(Dextromethorphan)-PREVENTS->(Seizures)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Competitive inhibition)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(NMDA receptor antagonist)\n(Dextromethorphan)-TREATS->(Complication)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(ADRBK1 gene|GRK2)-INTERACTS_WITH->(NMDA receptor antagonist)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Dextromethorphan is an NMDA receptor antagonist, which is known to increase the risk of dissociative effects, including hallucinations. This is supported by its mechanism of action involving NMDA receptor antagonism, which is associated with such effects. Diphenhydramine, due to its anticholinergic properties, can cause CNS effects like confusion, but hallucinations are less common and typically occur at high doses. Morphine, as an opioid receptor agonist, can alter mental status and potentially cause hallucinations, but this is more related to its sedative effects rather than a direct hallucinogenic property. Aprepitant, a substance P/neurokinin 1 receptor antagonist, is not commonly associated with hallucinations. Therefore, dextromethorphan is the most likely antitussive to cause hallucinations based on its pharmacological profile.\"\n}\n```",
