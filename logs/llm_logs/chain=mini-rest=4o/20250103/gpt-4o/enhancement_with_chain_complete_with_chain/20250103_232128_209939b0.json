      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        The administration of succinylcholine to a paraplegic patient led to appearance of dysarrythmias, conduction abnormalities and finally cardiac arrest. The most likely cause is :\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Hypercalcemia\nopb. Hyperkalemia\nopc. Anaphylaxis\nopd. Hypermagnesemia\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Succinylcholine administration\" -> \"increased potassium release from muscle cells\" -> \"hyperkalemia\" -> \"dysarrhythmias\" -> \"conduction abnormalities\" -> \"cardiac arrest\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Succinylcholine use in paraplegic patients\" -> \"risk of hyperkalemia due to denervation\" -> \"elevated serum potassium levels\" -> \"dysarrhythmias\" -> \"potential for cardiac arrest\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Succinylcholine\" -> \"causes depolarization of neuromuscular junction\" -> \"increased extracellular potassium\" -> \"hyperkalemia\" -> \"arrhythmias\" -> \"cardiac arrest\" -> 92%\nCHAIN: \"Succinylcholine\" -> \"can lead to potassium release\" -> \"hyperkalemia\" -> \"dysarrhythmias\" -> \"risk of cardiac arrest\" -> 88%\nCHAIN: \"Succinylcholine\" -> \"may cause adverse effects in certain populations\" -> \"paraplegic patients at risk for hyperkalemia\" -> \"dysarrhythmias\" -> \"cardiac arrest\" -> 85%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Succinylcholine)-TREATS->(hyperkalemia)\n(potassium)-CAUSES->(Hypertensive disease)-CAUSES->(hyperkalemia)\n(potassium)-TREATS->(Kidney Diseases)-CAUSES->(hyperkalemia)\n(potassium)-TREATS->(Diabetic Ketoacidosis)-CAUSES->(hyperkalemia)\n(hyperkalemia)-CAUSES->(cardiac arrhythmia)\n(Succinylcholine)-ISA->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Genes)-PART_OF->(Neuromuscular Junction)\n(Succinylcholine)-ISA->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Protein coding gene)-PART_OF->(Neuromuscular Junction)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"The administration of succinylcholine in paraplegic patients can lead to hyperkalemia due to increased potassium release from muscle cells, particularly in those with denervation or muscle atrophy. This elevated serum potassium can cause dysarrhythmias, conduction abnormalities, and potentially cardiac arrest. The retrieved evidence supports the link between hyperkalemia and cardiac arrhythmias, confirming the consensus that succinylcholine can exacerbate potassium release, leading to these severe cardiac events. Therefore, the most likely cause of the cardiac arrest in this scenario is hyperkalemia.\"\n}\n```",
