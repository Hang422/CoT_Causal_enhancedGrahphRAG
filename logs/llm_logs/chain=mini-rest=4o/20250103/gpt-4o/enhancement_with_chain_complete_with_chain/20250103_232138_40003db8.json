      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Anticoagulant of choice for prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism in patient with cancer surgery is:-\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Heparin sulfate\nopb. Protamine sulfate\nopc. Low molecular weight heparin\nopd. Warfarin\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Cancer surgery increases risk of venous thromboembolism\" -> \"Prophylaxis is recommended to prevent thromboembolic events\" -> \"Low molecular weight heparin is commonly used for prophylaxis\" -> \"Guidelines support low molecular weight heparin in cancer patients\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Heparin sulfate is an anticoagulant\" -> \"It is used for immediate anticoagulation\" -> \"Low molecular weight heparin is preferred for prophylaxis\" -> \"Heparin sulfate is not the first choice for prophylaxis\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Warfarin is an anticoagulant\" -> \"It requires monitoring and has delayed onset\" -> \"Not ideal for immediate prophylaxis post-surgery\" -> \"Low molecular weight heparin is preferred\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Protamine sulfate is an antidote for heparin\" -> \"It does not have anticoagulant properties\" -> \"Not applicable for prophylaxis\" -> \"Low molecular weight heparin is the choice\" -> 80%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Protamine Sulfate)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cells)-INTERACTS_WITH/LOCATION_OF->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Anticoagulants)\n(Heparin)-INTERACTS_WITH/ISA->(Anticoagulants)\n(Antidotes)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Anticoagulants)\n(anticoagulation)-PREVENTS->(Adverse event)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Heparin)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"For prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism in patients undergoing cancer surgery, low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) is the anticoagulant of choice. This is supported by clinical guidelines due to its efficacy and safety profile in this context. Heparin sulfate, while an anticoagulant, is typically used for immediate anticoagulation rather than prophylaxis, and is not the first choice in this scenario. Warfarin, although an anticoagulant, is not ideal for immediate post-surgical prophylaxis due to its delayed onset and need for monitoring. Protamine sulfate is not applicable as it is an antidote for heparin, not an anticoagulant. The retrieved evidence paths confirm that heparin and its derivatives are anticoagulants, but do not specifically address the prophylactic use in cancer surgery, thus supporting the consensus that LMWH is preferred.\"\n}\n```",
