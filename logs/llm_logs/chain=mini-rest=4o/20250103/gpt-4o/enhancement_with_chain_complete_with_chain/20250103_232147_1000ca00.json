      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Physiology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Shock causes:\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Stagnant hypoxia\nopb. Anemic hypoxia\nopc. Hypoxic hypoxia\nopd. Histotoxic hypoxia\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Shock\" -> \"decreased perfusion to tissues\" -> \"reduced oxygen delivery\" -> \"stagnant hypoxia\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Shock\" -> \"decreased blood volume\" -> \"reduced oxygen-carrying capacity\" -> \"anemic hypoxia\" -> 70%\nCHAIN: \"Shock\" -> \"impaired oxygen utilization\" -> \"inadequate oxygen at cellular level\" -> \"hypoxic hypoxia\" -> 75%\nCHAIN: \"Shock\" -> \"toxic substances in the blood\" -> \"impaired cellular respiration\" -> \"histotoxic hypoxia\" -> 80%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Oxygen)-COMPLICATES->(Hypoxia)\n(Shock)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(ARSE)-PART_OF->(Body tissue)\n(Shock)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(ACIN1 gene|ACIN1)-PART_OF->(Body tissue)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Shock is primarily associated with stagnant hypoxia due to decreased perfusion to tissues, leading to reduced oxygen delivery. This aligns with the consensus that shock results in impaired blood flow, causing oxygen to stagnate in tissues. Anemic hypoxia is less directly related to shock, as it involves reduced oxygen-carrying capacity, typically due to blood loss or anemia, rather than the perfusion issues seen in shock. Hypoxic hypoxia, characterized by inadequate oxygen at the cellular level, is more related to environmental or respiratory factors rather than shock. Histotoxic hypoxia involves impaired cellular respiration due to toxic substances, which is not a primary consequence of shock. The evidence paths broadly associate shock with body tissues and hypoxia, supporting the link between shock and stagnant hypoxia, but do not specifically address anemic, hypoxic, or histotoxic hypoxia in the context of shock.\"\n}\n```",
