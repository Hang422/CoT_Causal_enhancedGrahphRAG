Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        A 9-year-old boy diagnosed as uncomplicated pulmonary tuberculosis. He is put on isoniazid, rifampin, and ethambutol at home after initial treatment given at hospital. Which is accurate statement for this scenario?\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. His 3-year-old sibling should receive INH prophylaxis\nopb. A baseline test of auditory function test is essential before drug treatment is initiated\nopc. Polyahralgia is a potential adverse effect of the drugs the boy is taking\nopd. His mother, who takes care of him, does not need INH prophylaxis\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"The boy has uncomplicated pulmonary tuberculosis\" -> \"He is on isoniazid, rifampin, and ethambutol\" -> \"Isoniazid can cause tuberculosis transmission risk\" -> \"His 3-year-old sibling is at risk\" -> \"His 3-year-old sibling should receive INH prophylaxis\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"The boy is on ethambutol\" -> \"Ethambutol can cause optic neuritis\" -> \"Auditory function is not primarily affected by these drugs\" -> \"A baseline auditory function test is not essential\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"The boy is on isoniazid and rifampin\" -> \"These drugs can cause side effects\" -> \"Polyarthralgia is a known potential adverse effect\" -> \"Polyarthralgia is a potential adverse effect of the drugs the boy is taking\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"The mother is not infected with tuberculosis\" -> \"She is not at risk of developing tuberculosis\" -> \"She does not need INH prophylaxis\" -> \"His mother, who takes care of him, does not need INH prophylaxis\" -> 90%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Ethambutol)-TREATS->(Tuberculosis)\n(isoniazid)-CAUSES->(Tuberculosis)\n(Ethambutol)-TREATS->(Optic Neuritis)\n(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-CAUSES->(Adverse reactions)\n(Tuberculosis, Pulmonary)-MANIFESTATION_OF/PREDISPOSES->(Pathogenesis)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(NPM1 gene|NPM1)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Ethambutol)\n(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Lipopolysaccharides)-PART_OF->(Entire nerve)-LOCATION_OF->(Auditory function test)\n(Ethambutol)-TREATS->(Disease)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Hearing)\n(Ethambutol)-TREATS->(Meningitis)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Hearing)\n(isoniazid)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Melatonin)-INTERACTS_WITH/ISA->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"For option opa, the standard consensus is that young children living with someone diagnosed with active tuberculosis should receive isoniazid (INH) prophylaxis to prevent infection, supporting the statement that the 3-year-old sibling should receive INH prophylaxis. For option opb, ethambutol is known to cause optic neuritis, not auditory issues, so a baseline auditory function test is not essential before treatment. For option opc, while isoniazid and rifampin can cause various side effects, polyarthralgia is not a common or well-documented adverse effect of these drugs, making this statement less accurate. For option opd, the mother, if not infected or at risk, does not need INH prophylaxis, aligning with standard practice that only those at risk or exposed need prophylaxis. The evidence paths confirm ethambutol's association with optic neuritis and the general adverse reactions of pharmaceutical preparations, but do not directly support polyarthralgia as a side effect of isoniazid or rifampin.\"\n}\n```",
