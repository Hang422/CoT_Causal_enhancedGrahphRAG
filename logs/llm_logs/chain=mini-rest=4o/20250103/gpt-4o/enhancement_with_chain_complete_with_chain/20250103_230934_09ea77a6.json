      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Physiology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        All are TRUE about protease activated receptors, EXCEPT:\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Family of three seven transmembrane protein\nopb. Activated by thrombin\nopc. Releases PGE2\nopd. Protects epithelial cells\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Protease activated receptors (PARs) are a family of G protein-coupled receptors\" -> \"They consist of three main types: PAR1, PAR2, and PAR3\" -> \"Each type has seven transmembrane domains\" -> \"Therefore, the statement about being a family of three seven transmembrane proteins is TRUE\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Protease activated receptors are activated by proteolytic cleavage\" -> \"Thrombin is a well-known activator of PAR1\" -> \"This activation leads to various cellular responses\" -> \"Thus, the statement about being activated by thrombin is TRUE\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Protease activated receptors can influence the release of various mediators\" -> \"PGE2 is a prostaglandin involved in inflammation\" -> \"However, PARs primarily activate pathways leading to thromboxane and other mediators\" -> \"The direct release of PGE2 is not a primary function of PARs\" -> \"Therefore, the statement about releasing PGE2 is likely FALSE\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Protease activated receptors play a role in cell signaling\" -> \"They can influence protective mechanisms in epithelial cells\" -> \"However, their primary role is not solely protective\" -> \"The statement about protecting epithelial cells is somewhat ambiguous\" -> \"Thus, it may not be entirely accurate\" -> 80%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Receptors, Proteinase-Activated)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cells)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Dinoprostone)\n(Receptors, Proteinase-Activated)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cells)-LOCATION_OF->(Thrombin)\n(Receptors, Proteinase-Activated)-INTERACTS_WITH->(mast cell)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Thrombin)\n(Receptors, Proteinase-Activated)-CAUSES->(Prostaglandin Production)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Dinoprostone)\n(Dinoprostone)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cells)-PART_OF->(Smooth muscle (tissue))-LOCATION_OF->(Release - action)\n(Dinoprostone)-PART_OF->(Cells)-PART_OF->(Tissue fiber)-LOCATION_OF->(Release - action)\n(Receptors, Proteinase-Activated)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Epithelial Cells)\n(Dinoprostone)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cells)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)\n(Poly(ADP-ribose)-ribose) Polymerases)->(Cells)-INTERACTS_WITH/LOCATION_OF->(Dinoprostone)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Protease activated receptors (PARs) are a family of G protein-coupled receptors, consisting of PAR1, PAR2, and PAR3, each with seven transmembrane domains, confirming that they are a family of three seven transmembrane proteins. Thrombin is a well-known activator of PAR1, supporting the statement that they are activated by thrombin. While PARs can influence the release of various mediators, their primary role is not the direct release of PGE2, making the statement about releasing PGE2 likely false. PARs do play a role in cell signaling and can influence protective mechanisms in epithelial cells, but their primary function is not solely protective, making the statement about protecting epithelial cells somewhat ambiguous. Therefore, the statement about releasing PGE2 is the exception and likely false.\"\n}\n```",
