      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Physiology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Plasma membrane of cell is bounded to cytoskeleton by which of the following?\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Spectrin\nopb. Ankyrin\nopc. Tubulin\nopd. Laminin\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Plasma membrane\" -> \"interacts with cytoskeleton\" -> \"via cytoskeletal proteins\" -> \"Spectrin is a cytoskeletal protein\" -> \"Spectrin binds to membrane\" -> \"provides structural support\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Plasma membrane\" -> \"requires anchoring to cytoskeleton\" -> \"Ankyrin is an anchoring protein\" -> \"Ankyrin connects Spectrin to membrane\" -> \"facilitates membrane-cytoskeleton linkage\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Cytoskeleton\" -> \"composed of various proteins\" -> \"Tubulin is a component of microtubules\" -> \"not directly involved in membrane anchoring\" -> \"less relevant for plasma membrane binding\" -> 70%\nCHAIN: \"Laminin\" -> \"is a component of the extracellular matrix\" -> \"not directly associated with cytoskeleton\" -> \"does not bind plasma membrane to cytoskeleton\" -> \"less likely to be correct\" -> 60%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Cytoskeleton)-PART_OF->(Cells)-INTERACTS_WITH/LOCATION_OF->(Ankyrins)\n(Cytoskeleton)-PART_OF->(Cells)-LOCATION_OF->(Cytoskeletal Proteins)\n(Ankyrins)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cells)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Spectrin)\n(Cytoskeleton)-PART_OF->(Muscle Fibers)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cytoskeletal Proteins)\n(Cytoskeletal Proteins)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cells)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Spectrin)\n(Spectrin)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cells)-PART_OF->(Tissue membrane)\n(Ankyrins)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Erythrocytes)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Spectrin)\n(Laminin)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cells)-PART_OF->(Extracellular Matrix)\n(Cytoskeleton)-LOCATION_OF->(Proteins)\n(Cytoskeletal Proteins)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Erythrocytes)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Spectrin)\n(Spectrin)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Lymphocyte)-PART_OF->(Tissue membrane)\n(Laminin)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Neural Stem Cell)-PART_OF->(Extracellular Matrix)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"The plasma membrane is anchored to the cytoskeleton primarily through the interaction of spectrin and ankyrin. Spectrin is a cytoskeletal protein that provides structural support by forming a meshwork beneath the plasma membrane. Ankyrin acts as an anchoring protein that connects spectrin to the membrane, facilitating the linkage between the plasma membrane and the cytoskeleton. Tubulin, while a component of microtubules, does not directly anchor the plasma membrane to the cytoskeleton. Laminin is part of the extracellular matrix and does not play a role in binding the plasma membrane to the cytoskeleton. The evidence paths support the interaction between ankyrin and spectrin, confirming their roles in membrane-cytoskeleton linkage.\"\n}\n```",
