      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        The treatment of choice for bacterial vaginosis is :\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Clindamycin\nopb. Erythromycin\nopc. Ampicillin\nopd. Metronidazole\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Bacterial vaginosis is a common vaginal infection\" -> \"Treatment is aimed at restoring normal vaginal flora\" -> \"Metronidazole is effective against anaerobic bacteria\" -> \"Metronidazole is the first-line treatment for bacterial vaginosis\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Bacterial vaginosis is caused by an imbalance of vaginal bacteria\" -> \"Clindamycin is also effective against anaerobic bacteria\" -> \"Clindamycin is an alternative treatment for bacterial vaginosis\" -> \"However, Metronidazole is preferred\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Erythromycin is not typically used for bacterial vaginosis\" -> \"Ampicillin is not the first-line treatment\" -> \"Both are less effective compared to Metronidazole\" -> \"Metronidazole remains the treatment of choice\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Bacterial vaginosis is characterized by a specific set of symptoms\" -> \"Metronidazole is well-studied for this condition\" -> \"Clinical guidelines recommend Metronidazole as the primary treatment\" -> 92%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Bacterial Vaginosis)-PROCESS_OF->(Prevotella)-LOCATION_OF->(Clindamycin)\n(Bacterial Vaginosis)-PROCESS_OF->(Normal flora)-LOCATION_OF->(Clindamycin)\n(Clindamycin)-PREVENTS->(Pain)-CAUSES->(Disease)-CAUSES->(Bacterial Vaginosis)\n(Clindamycin)-PREVENTS->(Pain)-CAUSES->(Infection)-CAUSES->(Bacterial Vaginosis)\n(Clindamycin)-ISA->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Methotrexate)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Metronidazole)\n(Clindamycin)-ISA->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Adriamycin)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Metronidazole)\n(Bacterial Vaginosis)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Bacteria)-LOCATION_OF->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Methotrexate)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Metronidazole)\n(Bacterial Vaginosis)-PROCESS_OF->(Bacteria)-LOCATION_OF->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Adriamycin)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Metronidazole)\n(imbalance)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Prevotella)-LOCATION_OF->(Clindamycin)\n(imbalance)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Lactobacillus)-LOCATION_OF->(Clindamycin)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"The treatment of choice for bacterial vaginosis is Metronidazole. Bacterial vaginosis is a common vaginal infection caused by an imbalance of vaginal bacteria, often involving anaerobic bacteria. Metronidazole is effective against these anaerobic bacteria and is well-studied for this condition, making it the first-line treatment according to clinical guidelines. Clindamycin is also effective against anaerobic bacteria and serves as an alternative treatment, but Metronidazole is preferred due to its established efficacy and guideline recommendations. Erythromycin and Ampicillin are not typically used for bacterial vaginosis as they are less effective compared to Metronidazole. The retrieved evidence paths, while broad, support the use of Clindamycin as an alternative but do not contradict the consensus that Metronidazole is the primary treatment.\"\n}\n```",
