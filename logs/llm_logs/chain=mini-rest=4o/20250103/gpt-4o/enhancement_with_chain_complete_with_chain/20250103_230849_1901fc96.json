      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4.

Increased blood pressure caused by nicotine\nopb. Increased skeletal muscle strength caused by neostigmine, an acetycholine esterase inhibitor\nopc. Bradycardia caused by infusion of acetylcholine\nopd.

Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Atropine is a muscarinic receptor blocker, which means it can block the effects of acetylcholine on muscarinic receptors. This includes preventing bradycardia caused by acetylcholine, as bradycardia is mediated through muscarinic receptors in the heart. Atropine does not affect nicotinic receptors, so it cannot block the increased blood pressure caused by nicotine, which acts on nicotinic receptors. Similarly, atropine does not block the effects of neostigmine on skeletal muscle strength, as neostigmine increases acetylcholine levels that act on nicotinic receptors at the neuromuscular junction. Therefore, only the bradycardia caused by acetylcholine can be blocked by atropine. The retrieved evidence paths do not directly address the specific pharmacological actions of atropine, nicotine, or neostigmine in this context, so they are not incorporated into the final reasoning.\"\n}\n```",
