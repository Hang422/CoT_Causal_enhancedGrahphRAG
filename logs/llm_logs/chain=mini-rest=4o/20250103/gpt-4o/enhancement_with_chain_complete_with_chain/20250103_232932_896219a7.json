      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Praziquantel is used for the treatment of\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Strongyloidiasis\nopb. Trichomoniasis\nopc. Schistosomiasis\nopd. Rhinosporidiosis\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Praziquantel\" -> \"antiparasitic medication\" -> \"effective against trematodes\" -> \"commonly used for schistosomiasis\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Praziquantel\" -> \"antiparasitic medication\" -> \"not effective against nematodes\" -> \"strongyloidiasis is caused by nematodes\" -> 80%\nCHAIN: \"Praziquantel\" -> \"antiparasitic medication\" -> \"not indicated for trichomoniasis\" -> \"trichomoniasis is a protozoan infection\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Praziquantel\" -> \"antiparasitic medication\" -> \"not used for rhinosporidiosis\" -> \"rhinosporidiosis is caused by a fungus\" -> 90%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Trichomonas Infections)-PREDISPOSES->(Infection)-CAUSES->(Protozoan Infections)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Praziquantel is an antiparasitic medication primarily effective against trematodes, making it the treatment of choice for schistosomiasis, a disease caused by trematode parasites. It is not effective against nematodes, and therefore not used for strongyloidiasis, which is caused by nematodes. Additionally, praziquantel is not indicated for trichomoniasis, a protozoan infection, as confirmed by the evidence path linking Trichomonas infections to protozoan infections. Lastly, praziquantel is not used for rhinosporidiosis, which is caused by a fungus, not a parasite. Therefore, the correct use of praziquantel is for the treatment of schistosomiasis.\"\n}\n```",
