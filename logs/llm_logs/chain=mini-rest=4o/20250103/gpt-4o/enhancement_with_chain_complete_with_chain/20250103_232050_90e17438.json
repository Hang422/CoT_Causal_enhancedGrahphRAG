      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Aspirin is contraindicated in?\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Fever\nopb. Peptic ulcer\nopc. Unstable angina\nopd. Myalgia\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Aspirin\" -> \"inhibits platelet aggregation\" -> \"increased risk of bleeding\" -> \"contraindicated in peptic ulcer\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Aspirin\" -> \"reduces inflammation\" -> \"may be used in myalgia\" -> \"not contraindicated\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Aspirin\" -> \"can cause gastrointestinal irritation\" -> \"may worsen peptic ulcer\" -> \"contraindicated in peptic ulcer\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Aspirin\" -> \"used for cardiovascular protection\" -> \"beneficial in unstable angina\" -> \"not contraindicated\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Aspirin\" -> \"can cause Reye's syndrome in children\" -> \"contraindicated in fever in children\" -> \"possible contraindication\" -> 70%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Aspirin)-TREATS->(Reye Syndrome)\n(Aspirin)-PREVENTS->(Disease)-CAUSES->(Chloasma)-CAUSES->(Gastrointestinal irritation)\n(Aspirin)-PREVENTS->(Adverse effects)-CAUSES->(Chloasma)-CAUSES->(Gastrointestinal irritation)\n(Aspirin)-TREATS->(Dermo-)-CAUSES->(Chloasma)-CAUSES->(Gastrointestinal irritation)\n(Aspirin)-PREDISPOSES->(Inflammation)\n(Reye Syndrome)-CAUSES->(hypoglycemia)-CAUSES->(Fever)\n(Reye Syndrome)-COMPLICATES->(Virus Diseases)-CAUSES->(Fever)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Aspirin is contraindicated in peptic ulcer due to its ability to inhibit platelet aggregation and cause gastrointestinal irritation, both of which increase the risk of bleeding and can exacerbate ulcers. This aligns with the consensus that aspirin should be avoided in patients with peptic ulcers. Aspirin is not contraindicated in myalgia, as it is often used to reduce inflammation and pain. It is also not contraindicated in unstable angina, where it is beneficial for cardiovascular protection. However, aspirin is contraindicated in children with fever due to the risk of Reye's syndrome, a serious condition that can occur when aspirin is used in viral infections in children. The evidence paths support the contraindication in peptic ulcer and the risk of Reye's syndrome in children with fever, confirming the consensus understanding.\"\n}\n```",
