      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Aldosterone action is on :\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Proximal tubule\nopb. Distal tubules\nopc. Loop of Henle\nopd. Collecting duct\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Aldosterone\" -> \"acts on renal tubules\" -> \"increases sodium reabsorption\" -> \"primarily in distal tubules and collecting duct\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Aldosterone\" -> \"regulates electrolyte balance\" -> \"increases potassium excretion\" -> \"primarily in distal tubules and collecting duct\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Aldosterone\" -> \"stimulates sodium-potassium ATPase\" -> \"enhances sodium reabsorption\" -> \"most significant in distal tubules and collecting duct\" -> 92%\nCHAIN: \"Aldosterone\" -> \"influences water retention\" -> \"via sodium reabsorption\" -> \"mainly in distal tubules and collecting duct\" -> 93%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Aldosterone)-CAUSES->(Cytoprotection)-PROCESS_OF->(Renal tubule structure)\n(Aldosterone)-CAUSES->(Excretory function)-PROCESS_OF->(Renal tubule structure)\n(Aldosterone)-CAUSES->(uptake)-PROCESS_OF->(Renal tubule structure)\n(Aldosterone)-CAUSES->(Disease)-CAUSES->(Body fluid retention)\n(Aldosterone)-CAUSES->(Excretory function)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Electrolytes)\n(Aldosterone)-CAUSES->(Immunity)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Electrolytes)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Aldosterone primarily acts on the distal tubules and collecting duct of the renal tubules. It increases sodium reabsorption and potassium excretion, which are key functions in regulating electrolyte balance and water retention. This action is facilitated by stimulating sodium-potassium ATPase activity, enhancing sodium reabsorption. The retrieved evidence paths, while broad, support the role of aldosterone in influencing renal tubule structure and excretory function, which are associated with electrolyte management. Therefore, the consensus is that aldosterone's primary site of action is the distal tubules and collecting duct, aligning with the corrected reasoning chains.\"\n}\n```",
