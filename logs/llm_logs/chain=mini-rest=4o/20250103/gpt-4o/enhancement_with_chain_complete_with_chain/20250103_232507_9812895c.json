      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Following is not true concerning amyloidosis (NOT RELATED)\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Amyloidosis associated with multiple myeloma has the poorest prognosis\nopb. Fine - needle biopsy of subcutaneous abdominal fat is a simple & reliable method for diagnosing secondary systemic amyloidosis\nopc. Hepatic amyloid disease produces hepatomegaly but rarely jaundice\nopd. Amyloidosis of the spleen is associated with severe anemia\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Amyloidosis associated with multiple myeloma\" -> \"generally poor prognosis\" -> \"widely accepted in medical literature\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Fine-needle biopsy of subcutaneous abdominal fat\" -> \"used for diagnosing secondary systemic amyloidosis\" -> \"considered simple and reliable\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Hepatic amyloid disease\" -> \"can cause hepatomegaly\" -> \"jaundice is uncommon\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Amyloidosis of the spleen\" -> \"can lead to splenomegaly\" -> \"not typically associated with severe anemia\" -> \"conflict with known associations\" -> 70%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Splenomegaly)-CAUSES->(Anemia)\n(Spleen)-LOCATION_OF->(Splenomegaly)\n(Hepatomegaly)-CAUSES->(Disease)-CAUSES->(Icterus)\n(Hepatomegaly)-CAUSES->(Syndrome)-CAUSES->(Icterus)\n(Amyloidosis)-CAUSES->(Disease)-CAUSES->(Splenomegaly)\n(Amyloidosis)-CAUSES->(Infection)-CAUSES->(Splenomegaly)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Option opa: Amyloidosis associated with multiple myeloma is known to have a poor prognosis, aligning with medical consensus. Option opb: Fine-needle biopsy of subcutaneous abdominal fat is indeed a simple and reliable method for diagnosing secondary systemic amyloidosis, consistent with standard practice. Option opc: Hepatic amyloid disease typically causes hepatomegaly, and jaundice is rare, which is supported by medical literature. Option opd: While amyloidosis of the spleen can cause splenomegaly, it is not typically associated with severe anemia. The retrieved evidence paths suggest splenomegaly can be linked to anemia, but this is not a direct or common association in the context of amyloidosis, making option opd the least accurate statement regarding amyloidosis.\"\n}\n```",
