      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Which of the following causes retinal pigmentation?\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Quinine\nopb. Chloroquine\nopc. Mefloquine\nopd. Atovaquone\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Chloroquine\" -> \"retinal toxicity\" -> \"retinal pigmentation changes\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Quinine\" -> \"possible retinal effects\" -> \"unclear impact on pigmentation\" -> 60%\nCHAIN: \"Mefloquine\" -> \"neuropsychiatric side effects\" -> \"no established link to retinal pigmentation\" -> 50%\nCHAIN: \"Atovaquone\" -> \"antimalarial action\" -> \"no known retinal toxicity\" -> 40%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Chloroquine)-TREATS->(Disease)-CAUSES->(arterial stiffness)-PROCESS_OF->(Retina)\n(Chloroquine)-TREATS->(Disease)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(uptake)-PROCESS_OF->(Retina)\n(Chloroquine)-TREATS->(Disease)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(biological adaptation to stress)-PROCESS_OF->(Retina)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Chloroquine is known to cause retinal toxicity, which can lead to retinal pigmentation changes. This aligns with the consensus that chloroquine can cause retinopathy, characterized by pigmentation changes in the retina. The retrieved evidence paths, while broad, support the involvement of chloroquine in retinal processes, reinforcing its link to retinal pigmentation changes. Quinine has possible retinal effects, but there is no clear consensus on its impact on pigmentation. Mefloquine is associated with neuropsychiatric side effects and lacks an established link to retinal pigmentation. Atovaquone is primarily known for its antimalarial action and does not have known retinal toxicity. Therefore, chloroquine is the most likely option to cause retinal pigmentation changes.\"\n}\n```",
