      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Warfarin induced skin necrosis is seen in ?\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Protein C deficiency\nopb. Protein S deficiency\nopc. Hemophillia\nopd. Antithrombin III deficiency\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Warfarin use\" -> \"inhibition of vitamin K dependent clotting factors\" -> \"increased risk of thrombosis\" -> \"possible skin necrosis\" -> \"Protein C deficiency\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Warfarin use\" -> \"inhibition of vitamin K dependent proteins\" -> \"decreased Protein C levels\" -> \"thrombotic events\" -> \"skin necrosis\" -> \"Protein S deficiency\" -> 80%\nCHAIN: \"Warfarin use\" -> \"inhibition of clotting factors\" -> \"risk of skin necrosis\" -> \"not associated with Hemophilia\" -> \"unclear\" -> 50%\nCHAIN: \"Warfarin use\" -> \"inhibition of coagulation factors\" -> \"increased risk of skin necrosis\" -> \"not typically associated with Antithrombin III deficiency\" -> \"unclear\" -> 50%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Warfarin)-PREDISPOSES/PREVENTS->(Complication)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Blood Coagulation Factor)\n(Skin necrosis)-CAUSES->(Septicemia)-CAUSES->(Protein C Deficiency)\n(Skin necrosis)-COMPLICATES->(Purpura Fulminans)-CAUSES->(Protein C Deficiency)\n(Skin necrosis)-CAUSES->(Disease)-CAUSES->(Protein S Deficiency)\n(Skin necrosis)-COMPLICATES->(Nephrotic Syndrome)-CAUSES->(Protein S Deficiency)\n(Blood Coagulation Factor)-TREATS->(Thrombophilia)-CAUSES->(Skin necrosis)\n(Blood Coagulation Factor)-TREATS->(Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation)-CAUSES->(Skin necrosis)\n(Skin necrosis)-CAUSES->(Disease)-CAUSES->(Antithrombin III Deficiency)\n(Skin necrosis)-COMPLICATES->(Nephrotic Syndrome)-CAUSES->(Antithrombin III Deficiency)\n(Skin necrosis)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Thrombosis)-CAUSES->(Antithrombin III Deficiency)\n(Warfarin)-INTERACTS_WITH/ISA->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Vitamin K)\n(Vitamin K)-PREDISPOSES->(Thrombosis)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Warfarin-induced skin necrosis is most commonly associated with Protein C deficiency. Warfarin inhibits vitamin K-dependent clotting factors, including Protein C, which is a natural anticoagulant. In individuals with Protein C deficiency, this inhibition can lead to a paradoxical increase in thrombosis risk, resulting in skin necrosis. The evidence paths support this by linking skin necrosis to conditions like Purpura Fulminans, which is associated with Protein C deficiency. While Protein S deficiency can also be involved, it is less commonly associated with warfarin-induced skin necrosis. Hemophilia and Antithrombin III deficiency are not typically linked to this condition. Therefore, the most consensus-aligned answer is Protein C deficiency.\"\n}\n```",
