      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Physiology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        In circulatory biomechanics which of the following is true?\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Blood viscosity is increased in anemia\nopb. Blood viscosity is decreased in polycythemia\nopc. Cardiac output is increased in anemia\nopd. Cardiac output is decreased in Beri-Beri\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Anemia\" -> \"decreased red blood cell count\" -> \"decreased blood viscosity\" -> \"increased cardiac output to maintain perfusion\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Polycythemia\" -> \"increased red blood cell count\" -> \"increased blood viscosity\" -> \"possible decrease in cardiac output\" -> 70%\nCHAIN: \"Beri-Beri\" -> \"impaired cardiovascular function\" -> \"decreased cardiac output\" -> \"possible compensatory mechanisms\" -> 80%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Red Blood Cell Count measurement)-DIAGNOSES->(Thrombus)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Blood Viscosity)\n(Erythrocytes)-INTERACTS_WITH/LOCATION_OF->(Hemoglobin)-CAUSES->(Blood Viscosity)\n(Blood Viscosity)-PROCESS_OF->(Cerebral cortex)-LOCATION_OF->(Deoxyglucose)-ISA->(Perfusion (procedure))\n(Blood Viscosity)-PROCESS_OF->(Cerebral cortex)-LOCATION_OF->(Ouabain)-ISA->(Perfusion (procedure))\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"In circulatory biomechanics, the following consensus-aligned facts are relevant: In anemia, there is a decreased red blood cell count, which leads to decreased blood viscosity. This reduction in viscosity can result in increased cardiac output as a compensatory mechanism to maintain adequate tissue perfusion. Therefore, the statement 'Cardiac output is increased in anemia' is true. In polycythemia, the increased red blood cell count leads to increased blood viscosity, which can potentially decrease cardiac output due to increased resistance in blood flow, contradicting the statement 'Blood viscosity is decreased in polycythemia.' In Beri-Beri, cardiovascular function is impaired, but typically, cardiac output is increased due to vasodilation and high-output heart failure, contradicting the statement 'Cardiac output is decreased in Beri-Beri.' The retrieved evidence paths, while broad, support the relationship between red blood cell count and blood viscosity, confirming the consensus that changes in red blood cell count affect blood viscosity and subsequently cardiac output.\"\n}\n```",
