      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Drug used in cancer chemotherapy induced vomiting is?\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Aprepitant\nopb. Dexamethasone\nopc. Ondansetrin\nopd. All of the above\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Aprepitant\" -> \"substance P antagonist\" -> \"reduces nausea and vomiting\" -> \"effective in chemotherapy-induced vomiting\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Dexamethasone\" -> \"corticosteroid\" -> \"anti-inflammatory effects\" -> \"reduces nausea in chemotherapy\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Ondansetron\" -> \"5-HT3 receptor antagonist\" -> \"prevents nausea and vomiting\" -> \"commonly used in chemotherapy\" -> 92%\nCHAIN: \"All of the above\" -> \"includes Aprepitant, Dexamethasone, and Ondansetron\" -> \"all effective for chemotherapy-induced vomiting\" -> 93%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Dexamethasone)-INTERACTS_WITH/ISA->(Adrenal Cortex Hormones)\n([D]Nausea and vomiting NOS)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Helicobacter pylori)-LOCATION_OF->(Ascorbic Acid)-ISA->(Pharmacotherapy)\n(Ondansetron)-ISA->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Anti-Anxiety Agents)-INTERACTS_WITH->(5-HT>3< receptor antagonist)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"In the context of chemotherapy-induced vomiting, all three drugs—Aprepitant, Dexamethasone, and Ondansetron—are effective and commonly used. Aprepitant is a substance P antagonist that reduces nausea and vomiting, particularly effective in chemotherapy-induced cases. Dexamethasone, a corticosteroid, has anti-inflammatory effects that help reduce nausea associated with chemotherapy. Ondansetron is a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist, widely used to prevent nausea and vomiting in chemotherapy patients. The retrieved evidence paths, while broad, confirm the roles of these drugs in pharmacotherapy and their interactions with relevant biological pathways. Therefore, the option 'All of the above' is correct, as it encompasses all three drugs that are effective for chemotherapy-induced vomiting.\"\n}\n```",
