      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Drug of choice for pregnant female suspected of having a baby with congenital adrenal hyperplasia\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Dexamethasone\nopb. Betamethasone\nopc. Hydrocoisone\nopd. Prednisolone\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Congenital adrenal hyperplasia suspected\" -> \"Need to prevent virilization in female fetus\" -> \"Dexamethasone is effective in reducing androgen production\" -> \"Dexamethasone is the drug of choice\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Pregnant female with suspected congenital adrenal hyperplasia\" -> \"Risk of fetal adrenal crisis\" -> \"Hydrocortisone is used for adrenal insufficiency\" -> \"Not the first-line treatment for prevention of virilization\" -> \"Dexamethasone preferred\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Congenital adrenal hyperplasia in pregnancy\" -> \"Dexamethasone reduces fetal androgen exposure\" -> \"Betamethasone primarily used for fetal lung maturity\" -> \"Not indicated for congenital adrenal hyperplasia\" -> \"Dexamethasone is the drug of choice\" -> 92%\nCHAIN: \"Pregnant female with congenital adrenal hyperplasia risk\" -> \"Need to manage hormonal levels\" -> \"Prednisolone is less effective than dexamethasone\" -> \"Dexamethasone is preferred for this condition\" -> 88%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Betamethasone)-COMPLICATES->(Disease)-CAUSES->(Virilism)-CAUSES->(Congenital adrenal hyperplasia)\n(Betamethasone)-COMPLICATES->(Disease)-CAUSES->(Enzyme Deficiency)-CAUSES->(Congenital adrenal hyperplasia)\n(Betamethasone)-COMPLICATES->(Disease)-CAUSES->(Hepatitis, Chronic Active)-CAUSES->(Congenital adrenal hyperplasia)\n(Dexamethasone)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Betamethasone)\n(Congenital adrenal hyperplasia)-PREDISPOSES->(Inflammation)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Dexamethasone)\n(Dexamethasone)-INTERACTS_WITH/ISA->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)\n(prednisolone)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Dexamethasone)\n(Congenital adrenal hyperplasia)-CAUSES/PREDISPOSES->(Disease)-ASSOCIATED_WITH/INTERACTS_WITH->(Virus)-LOCATION_OF->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)\n(Hydrocortisone)-PART_OF->(Epidermis)-LOCATION_OF->(First line treatment)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"In the context of a pregnant female suspected of having a baby with congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), the primary concern is preventing virilization in a female fetus. The standard medical consensus supports the use of dexamethasone for this purpose, as it effectively reduces fetal androgen production. Dexamethasone is preferred over other corticosteroids like betamethasone, which is primarily used for promoting fetal lung maturity, and hydrocortisone, which is used for treating adrenal insufficiency but not specifically for preventing virilization in CAH. Prednisolone is less effective than dexamethasone in this context. The evidence paths, while broad, indicate interactions between dexamethasone and other corticosteroids, supporting its role in managing conditions associated with CAH. Therefore, dexamethasone is the drug of choice for preventing virilization in a fetus at risk of CAH.\"\n}\n```",
