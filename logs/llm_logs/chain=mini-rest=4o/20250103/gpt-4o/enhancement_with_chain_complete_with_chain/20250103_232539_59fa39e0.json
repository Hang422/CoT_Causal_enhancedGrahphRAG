      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Pimozide belongs to class of:\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Thiothixanthene\nopb. Phenothiazine\nopc. Butyrophenone\nopd. Diphenyl butyl piperidine\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Pimozide\" -> \"antipsychotic medication\" -> \"belongs to a specific drug class\" -> \"identified as a butyrophenone\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Pimozide\" -> \"used for Tourette syndrome\" -> \"antipsychotic properties\" -> \"classified under butyrophenones\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Pimozide\" -> \"dopamine receptor antagonist\" -> \"similar to other antipsychotics\" -> \"specifically a butyrophenone\" -> 92%\nCHAIN: \"Pimozide\" -> \"not a phenothiazine\" -> \"not a thiothixanthene\" -> \"not a diphenyl butyl piperidine\" -> \"confirmed as a butyrophenone\" -> 93%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Pimozide)-TREATS->(Gilles de la Tourette syndrome)\n(Pimozide)-ISA->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Antipsychotic Agents)\n(Pimozide)-ISA->(Psychotropic Drugs)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Antipsychotic Agents)\n(Pimozide)-ISA->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Dopamine Antagonists)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Pimozide is an antipsychotic medication primarily used to treat Tourette syndrome and functions as a dopamine receptor antagonist. It is classified under the diphenyl butyl piperidine class of antipsychotic agents, not as a butyrophenone. The retrieved evidence paths confirm its use in treating Tourette syndrome and its interaction with antipsychotic agents and dopamine antagonists, supporting its classification as a diphenyl butyl piperidine. Therefore, the correct classification for Pimozide is diphenyl butyl piperidine.\"\n}\n```",
