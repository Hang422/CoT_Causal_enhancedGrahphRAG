      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Which of the following antitubercular drugs can be safely used in severe renal failure :\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Streptomycin\nopb. Ethambutol\nopc. Capreomycin\nopd. Rifampicin\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Streptomycin\" -> \"primarily excreted by kidneys\" -> \"accumulation in severe renal failure\" -> \"risk of toxicity\" -> 70%\nCHAIN: \"Ethambutol\" -> \"partially renally excreted\" -> \"dose adjustment required in renal failure\" -> \"can be used with caution\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Capreomycin\" -> \"excreted by kidneys\" -> \"risk of nephrotoxicity in renal failure\" -> \"not recommended\" -> 60%\nCHAIN: \"Rifampicin\" -> \"primarily metabolized by liver\" -> \"minimal renal excretion\" -> \"generally safe in renal failure\" -> 90%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Streptomycin)-TREATS->(Infection)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(biological adaptation to stress)-PROCESS_OF->(Kidney)\n(Streptomycin)-TREATS->(Tuberculosis)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(biological adaptation to stress)-PROCESS_OF->(Kidney)\n(Streptomycin)-TREATS->(Infection)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(tissue tropism)-PROCESS_OF->(Kidney)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"In severe renal failure, the choice of antitubercular drugs must consider renal excretion and potential toxicity. Streptomycin is primarily excreted by the kidneys, leading to accumulation and increased risk of toxicity in renal failure, making it unsafe. Ethambutol is partially renally excreted, requiring dose adjustment, and can be used with caution. Capreomycin is also excreted by the kidneys and poses a risk of nephrotoxicity, thus not recommended. Rifampicin is primarily metabolized by the liver with minimal renal excretion, making it generally safe for use in severe renal failure. Therefore, Rifampicin is the safest option among the listed drugs for patients with severe renal failure.\"\n}\n```",
