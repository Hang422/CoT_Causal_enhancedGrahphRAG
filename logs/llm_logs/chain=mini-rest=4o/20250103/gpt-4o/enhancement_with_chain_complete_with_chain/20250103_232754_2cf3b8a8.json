      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        All of the following can be used to treat alcohol dependence except\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Naltrexone\nopb. Acamprosate\nopc. Flumazenil\nopd. Disulfiram\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Naltrexone\" -> \"reduces cravings for alcohol\" -> \"used in alcohol dependence treatment\" -> 95% CHAIN: \"Acamprosate\" -> \"helps maintain abstinence\" -> \"used in alcohol dependence treatment\" -> 90% CHAIN: \"Disulfiram\" -> \"causes unpleasant reactions to alcohol\" -> \"used in alcohol dependence treatment\" -> 85% CHAIN: \"Flumazenil\" -> \"reverses benzodiazepine effects\" -> \"not indicated for alcohol dependence\" -> 95%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Benzodiazepines)-TREATS->(Alcoholic Intoxication, Chronic)\n(acamprosate)-ISA->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Genes)-PART_OF->(Body tissue)-LOCATION_OF->(Abstinence)\n(acamprosate)-ISA->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(ARSE)-PART_OF->(Body tissue)-LOCATION_OF->(Abstinence)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Naltrexone, Acamprosate, and Disulfiram are all used in the treatment of alcohol dependence. Naltrexone works by reducing cravings for alcohol, Acamprosate helps maintain abstinence, and Disulfiram causes unpleasant reactions when alcohol is consumed, deterring use. Flumazenil, however, is used to reverse the effects of benzodiazepines and is not indicated for the treatment of alcohol dependence. The evidence paths related to Acamprosate confirm its role in maintaining abstinence, aligning with its use in alcohol dependence treatment. The path mentioning benzodiazepines treating alcohol intoxication is not directly relevant to Flumazenil's role in alcohol dependence treatment, supporting the consensus that Flumazenil is not used for this purpose.\"\n}\n```",
