      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Steroids are indicated in all of the following forms of tuberculosis except:\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Meningitis\nopb. Pericarditis\nopc. Ileo-caecal tuberculosis\nopd. Adrenal involvement\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: Meningitis -> \"Steroids indicated to reduce inflammation\" -> \"Improved neurological outcomes\" -> 90% CHAIN: Pericarditis -> \"Steroids indicated to reduce pericardial inflammation\" -> \"Decreased risk of cardiac complications\" -> 90% CHAIN: Ileo-caecal tuberculosis -> \"Steroids not typically indicated\" -> \"Risk of exacerbating infection\" -> 80% CHAIN: Adrenal involvement -> \"Steroids indicated for adrenal insufficiency\" -> \"Restoration of hormonal balance\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: Meningitis -> \"Steroids indicated to reduce inflammation\" -> \"Improved neurological outcomes\" -> 90% CHAIN: Pericarditis -> \"Steroids indicated to reduce pericardial inflammation\" -> \"Decreased risk of cardiac complications\" -> 90% CHAIN: Ileo-caecal tuberculosis -> \"Steroids not indicated\" -> \"Potential for worsening disease\" -> 75% CHAIN: Adrenal involvement -> \"Steroids indicated for adrenal insufficiency\" -> \"Restoration of hormonal balance\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: Meningitis -> \"Steroids indicated to reduce inflammation\" -> \"Improved neurological outcomes\" -> 90% CHAIN: Pericarditis -> \"Steroids indicated to reduce pericardial inflammation\" -> \"Decreased risk of cardiac complications\" -> 90% CHAIN: Ileo-caecal tuberculosis -> \"Steroids contraindicated\" -> \"Risk of worsening infection\" -> 70% CHAIN: Adrenal involvement -> \"Steroids indicated for adrenal insufficiency\" -> \"Restoration of hormonal balance\" -> 90%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Pericarditis)-ISA->(Inflammation)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(ELAVL2 gene|ELAVL2)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Steroids)\n(Pericarditis)-ISA->(Inflammation)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(IL13 gene|IL13)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Steroids)\n(Steroids)-TREATS->(Disease)-CAUSES->(Cardiac complication)\n(Steroids)-TREATS->(Hypertensive disease)-CAUSES->(Cardiac complication)\n(Steroids)-TREATS->(Disease)-CAUSES->(Communicable Diseases)\n(Steroids)-TREATS->(Lymphohistiocytosis, Hemophagocytic)-CAUSES->(Communicable Diseases)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"In tuberculosis, steroids are indicated for certain forms to reduce inflammation and improve outcomes. For meningitis, steroids are used to reduce inflammation and improve neurological outcomes, aligning with consensus. In pericarditis, steroids help reduce pericardial inflammation and decrease cardiac complications, supported by evidence paths showing steroids' interaction with inflammation-related genes. For adrenal involvement, steroids are indicated to address adrenal insufficiency and restore hormonal balance. However, in ileo-caecal tuberculosis, steroids are not typically indicated due to the risk of exacerbating the infection, which aligns with standard medical consensus. Therefore, the exception where steroids are not indicated is ileo-caecal tuberculosis.\"\n}\n```",
