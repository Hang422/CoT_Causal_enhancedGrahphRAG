      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Physiology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        True regarding respiratory centre\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Directly simulated by fall in PaO2\nopb. Connected with cardiac center\nopc. Inhibited during swallowing\nopd. Situated in midbrain\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Respiratory center\" -> \"Regulates breathing\" -> \"Monitors blood gases\" -> \"Responds to fall in PaO2\" -> \"Stimulates increased ventilation\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Respiratory center\" -> \"Located in the brainstem\" -> \"Interacts with cardiac center\" -> \"Coordinates respiratory and cardiac functions\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Respiratory center\" -> \"Involved in reflex actions\" -> \"Inhibited during swallowing\" -> \"Prevents aspiration\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Respiratory center\" -> \"Located in the medulla and pons\" -> \"Not situated in midbrain\" -> \"Unclear\" -> 70%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Medulla Oblongata)-PART_OF->(Midbrain structure)\n(Pontine structure)-PART_OF->(Midbrain structure)\n(PO2 measurement)-DIAGNOSES->(Hypoxia)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Respiration)\n(PO2 measurement)-DIAGNOSES->(Acute respiratory failure)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Respiration)\n(Biomedical Monitors)-TREATS->(Inflammation)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Genes)-PART_OF->(Mucous Membrane)-LOCATION_OF->(PO2 measurement)\n(Biomedical Monitors)-CAUSES->(Atherosclerosis)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Genes)-PART_OF->(Mucous Membrane)-LOCATION_OF->(PO2 measurement)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"The respiratory center is primarily located in the medulla oblongata and pons, not the midbrain, and is responsible for regulating breathing by monitoring blood gases such as CO2 and O2. It is not directly stimulated by a fall in PaO2; rather, it is more sensitive to changes in PaCO2 and pH levels. The respiratory center is connected with the cardiac center, allowing coordination between respiratory and cardiac functions. During swallowing, the respiratory center is inhibited to prevent aspiration, aligning with reflex actions. The retrieved evidence paths broadly confirm the involvement of the medulla and pons in respiratory functions but do not directly address the specific mechanisms of respiratory center stimulation or inhibition.\"\n}\n```",
