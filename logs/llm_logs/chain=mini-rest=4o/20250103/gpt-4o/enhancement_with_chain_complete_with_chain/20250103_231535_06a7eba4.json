      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Physiology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        The fluidity of the plasma membrane is increased by\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Arachidonic acid\nopb. Cholesterol\nopc. Palmitic acid\nopd. Stearic acid\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Arachidonic acid\" -> \"increased membrane fluidity\" -> \"enhanced cell signaling\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Cholesterol\" -> \"maintains membrane integrity\" -> \"prevents excessive fluidity\" -> \"decreased fluidity\" -> 70%\nCHAIN: \"Palmitic acid\" -> \"saturated fatty acid\" -> \"decreased membrane fluidity\" -> \"increased rigidity\" -> 75%\nCHAIN: \"Stearic acid\" -> \"saturated fatty acid\" -> \"decreased membrane fluidity\" -> \"increased rigidity\" -> 75%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Palmitic Acid)-PART_OF->(Cells)-LOCATION_OF->(saturated fat)\n(Palmitic Acid)-PART_OF->(Liver)-LOCATION_OF->(saturated fat)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"The fluidity of the plasma membrane is influenced by the types of fatty acids present. Arachidonic acid, a polyunsaturated fatty acid, increases membrane fluidity due to its multiple double bonds, which introduce kinks in the fatty acid chains, preventing tight packing. This aligns with the consensus that unsaturated fatty acids enhance membrane fluidity. Cholesterol, while maintaining membrane integrity, can both increase and decrease fluidity depending on temperature and concentration, but generally acts to stabilize the membrane, preventing excessive fluidity. Palmitic acid and stearic acid are saturated fatty acids, which decrease membrane fluidity by allowing tighter packing of the lipid bilayer. The retrieved evidence paths confirm the presence of palmitic acid as a saturated fat, supporting its role in decreasing fluidity. Therefore, arachidonic acid is the most likely to increase membrane fluidity.\"\n}\n```",
