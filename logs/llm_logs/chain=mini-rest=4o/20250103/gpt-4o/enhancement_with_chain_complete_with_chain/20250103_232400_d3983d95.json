      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Physiology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Lipids are transferred from intestine to liver by\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Chylomicrons\nopb. VLDL\nopc. HDL\nopd. LDL\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Lipids absorbed in intestine\" -> \"Chylomicrons formed in intestinal cells\" -> \"Chylomicrons enter lymphatic system\" -> \"Chylomicrons transported to bloodstream\" -> \"Chylomicrons deliver lipids to liver\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Dietary fats ingested\" -> \"Intestinal mucosa processes fats\" -> \"Chylomicrons released into circulation\" -> \"Chylomicrons carry lipids to liver\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Lipids from food\" -> \"Intestinal absorption\" -> \"Formation of chylomicrons\" -> \"Chylomicrons transport lipids to liver\" -> 92%\nCHAIN: \"Lipids enter bloodstream\" -> \"Chylomicrons transport lipids\" -> \"Chylomicrons deliver to liver\" -> 93%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Intestinal Mucosa)-LOCATION_OF->(Lipids)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Chylomicrons)\n(Lipids)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Chylomicrons)\n(Chylomicrons)-CAUSES->(uptake)-PROCESS_OF->(Liver)\n(Intestines)-LOCATION_OF->(Diastasis)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Chylomicrons)\n(Intestines)-LOCATION_OF->(Functional disorder)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Chylomicrons)\n(Fatty acid glycerol esters)-PART_OF->(Cells)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Chylomicrons)\n(Fatty acid glycerol esters)-PART_OF->(Adipocytes)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Chylomicrons)\n(Dietary Fats)-INTERACTS_WITH/ISA->(Lipids)-PART_OF->(Intestinal Mucosa)\n(intestinal cell)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Chylomicrons)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"The transfer of lipids from the intestine to the liver is primarily facilitated by chylomicrons. After dietary fats are ingested, they are processed by the intestinal mucosa, where chylomicrons are formed. These chylomicrons enter the lymphatic system and then the bloodstream, ultimately delivering lipids to the liver. This process is supported by evidence showing the interaction of lipids with chylomicrons and the role of chylomicrons in lipid uptake by the liver. Other lipoproteins like VLDL, HDL, and LDL have different roles in lipid transport and metabolism, but they do not primarily transfer lipids from the intestine to the liver. Therefore, the correct answer is that chylomicrons are responsible for this transfer.\"\n}\n```",
