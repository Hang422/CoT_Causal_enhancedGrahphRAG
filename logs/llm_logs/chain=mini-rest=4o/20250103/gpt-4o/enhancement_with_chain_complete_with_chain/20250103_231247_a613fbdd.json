      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Physiology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Enzymatic markers of plasma membrane include all except\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. 5'-nucleotidase\nopb. Adenylyl cyclase\nopc. Na+-K+-ATPase\nopd. Galactosyl transferase\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"5'-nucleotidase\" -> \"known as a plasma membrane enzyme\" -> \"not an exception\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Adenylyl cyclase\" -> \"associated with plasma membrane\" -> \"not an exception\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Na+-K+-ATPase\" -> \"integral to plasma membrane function\" -> \"not an exception\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Galactosyl transferase\" -> \"primarily located in Golgi apparatus\" -> \"is an exception\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Enzymatic markers of plasma membrane\" -> \"include 5'-nucleotidase, Adenylyl cyclase, Na+-K+-ATPase\" -> \"exclude Galactosyl transferase\" -> 90%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Adenylate Cyclase)-INTERACTS_WITH->(CAMP)-PART_OF->(Cell membrane)\n(Adenylate Cyclase)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Phosphatidic Acid)-PART_OF->(Cell membrane)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Enzymatic markers of the plasma membrane typically include enzymes such as 5'-nucleotidase, adenylyl cyclase, and Na+-K+-ATPase, all of which are associated with the plasma membrane. 5'-nucleotidase is known for its role in nucleotide metabolism at the cell surface, adenylyl cyclase is involved in the conversion of ATP to cyclic AMP and is a key component of signal transduction pathways at the plasma membrane, and Na+-K+-ATPase is crucial for maintaining the electrochemical gradient across the plasma membrane. In contrast, galactosyl transferase is primarily located in the Golgi apparatus, where it functions in glycosylation processes, making it an exception to the list of plasma membrane enzymatic markers. The retrieved evidence paths support the association of adenylyl cyclase with the cell membrane, reinforcing its role as a plasma membrane enzyme. Therefore, the correct answer is that galactosyl transferase is not an enzymatic marker of the plasma membrane.\"\n}\n```",
