      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        The patient is being administered i.v. quinine following which he developed restlessness and sweating, the most likely cause is :\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Hypoglycemia\nopb. Cinchonism\nopc. Arrhythmias\nopd. Sweating\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Administration of i.v. quinine\" -> \"possible side effects\" -> \"restlessness and sweating\" -> \"Cinchonism\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Quinine administration\" -> \"increased stimulation of the central nervous system\" -> \"restlessness\" -> \"sweating\" -> \"Cinchonism\" -> 80%\nCHAIN: \"Quinine given intravenously\" -> \"adverse reactions\" -> \"restlessness and sweating\" -> \"possible hypoglycemia\" -> \"unclear\" -> 60%\nCHAIN: \"Quinine infusion\" -> \"cardiovascular effects\" -> \"arrhythmias\" -> \"possible sweating\" -> \"unclear\" -> 55%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Agitation)-CAUSES->(Symptoms)-CAUSES->(hypoglycemia)\n(Quinine)-TREATS->(Disease)-CAUSES->(Adverse reactions)\n(Quinine)-TREATS->(COVID-19)-CAUSES->(Adverse reactions)\n(Quinine)-TREATS->(Syndrome)-CAUSES->(Adverse reactions)\n(Agitation)-CAUSES->(Disease)-CAUSES->(hypoglycemia)\n(Agitation)-PREDISPOSES->(Myocardial Infarction)-CAUSES->(hypoglycemia)\n(Stimulation procedure)-CAUSES->(Disease)-CAUSES->(Agitation)\n(Stimulation procedure)-TREATS->(Symptoms)-CAUSES->(Agitation)\n(Adverse reactions)-CAUSES->(Disease)-CAUSES->(Agitation)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Intravenous administration of quinine is known to cause hypoglycemia, which can lead to symptoms such as restlessness and sweating. This aligns with the standard medical consensus that hypoglycemia is a common side effect of quinine, especially when administered intravenously. The retrieved evidence paths support the link between agitation (restlessness) and hypoglycemia, reinforcing this interpretation. While cinchonism is a known side effect of quinine, it typically presents with symptoms like tinnitus, headache, and dizziness, rather than restlessness and sweating. Arrhythmias are a possible but less common side effect of quinine and are not directly linked to the symptoms described. Therefore, the most likely cause of the patient's symptoms is hypoglycemia.\"\n}\n```",
