      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        In a CA lung patient is suffering from dyspnoea, the palliation of dyspnoea is achieved by\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Morphine patch\nopb. Diazepam\nopc. Clobazam\nopd. Haloperidol\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Morphine patch\" -> \"decreased perception of breathlessness\" -> \"reduced dyspnoea\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Diazepam\" -> \"anxiolytic effect\" -> \"reduced anxiety related to dyspnoea\" -> \"possible improvement in comfort\" -> 70%\nCHAIN: \"Clobazam\" -> \"anxiolytic effect\" -> \"reduced anxiety\" -> \"possible improvement in dyspnoea\" -> 65%\nCHAIN: \"Haloperidol\" -> \"antipsychotic effect\" -> \"possible reduction in anxiety\" -> \"unclear impact on dyspnoea\" -> 60%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Morphine)-PREVENTS->(Dyspnea)\n(Anxiety)-CAUSES->(Disease)-CAUSES->(Dyspnea)\n(Anxiety)-CAUSES->(Obesity)-CAUSES->(Dyspnea)\n(Anxiety)-CAUSES->(Hypertensive disease)-CAUSES->(Dyspnea)\n(Anti-Anxiety Effect)-Anxiety Effect)->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-CAUSES/PREDISPOSES->(Dyspnea)\n(Diazepam)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(HCRTR2 gene|HCRTR2)-CAUSES->(Anti-Anxiety Effect)\n(Diazepam)-ISA->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(agonists)-CAUSES->(Anti-Anxiety Effect)\n(clobazam)-TREATS->(Adverse effects)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(pregabalin)-CAUSES->(Anti-Anxiety Effect)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"In the management of dyspnoea in a lung cancer patient, morphine is widely recognized for its effectiveness in reducing the perception of breathlessness, thus providing significant palliation of dyspnoea. This aligns with the evidence path indicating that morphine prevents dyspnoea. Diazepam and clobazam, both having anxiolytic effects, may help reduce anxiety-related dyspnoea, but their primary role is not direct palliation of dyspnoea. The evidence paths support the anxiolytic effects of these medications but do not directly link them to dyspnoea relief. Haloperidol, primarily an antipsychotic, has an unclear impact on dyspnoea and is not typically used for this purpose. Therefore, the morphine patch is the most consensus-supported option for palliation of dyspnoea in this context.\"\n}\n```",
