      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Physiology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        The most important action of Secretin is to\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. neutralize the acid from the stomach\nopb. increase secretion of bicarbonates by pancreas\nopc. decrease gastric secretion\nopd. cause contraction of pyloric sphincter\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Secretin release\" -> \"stimulates pancreatic duct cells\" -> \"increased bicarbonate secretion\" -> \"neutralizes gastric acid in the duodenum\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Secretin\" -> \"increases bicarbonate secretion by pancreas\" -> \"neutralizes stomach acid\" -> \"facilitates optimal enzyme function\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Secretin\" -> \"acts on pancreas\" -> \"promotes bicarbonate release\" -> \"increases pH in the small intestine\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Secretin\" -> \"inhibits gastric acid secretion\" -> \"reduces acidity in the stomach\" -> \"promotes digestive enzyme activity\" -> 80%\nCHAIN: \"Secretin\" -> \"causes pancreatic bicarbonate secretion\" -> \"neutralizes gastric acid\" -> \"enhances intestinal digestion\" -> 90%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Secretin)-CAUSES->(fluid secretion)-PROCESS_OF->(Pancreas)\n(Secretin)-CAUSES->(Vasodilation)-PROCESS_OF->(Pancreas)\n(Secretin)-CAUSES->(Excretory function)-PROCESS_OF->(Pancreas)\n(Pancreas)-PART_OF->(Cells)-LOCATION_OF->(Bicarbonates)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"The most important action of Secretin is to increase the secretion of bicarbonates by the pancreas. Secretin is released in response to acidic chyme entering the duodenum. It stimulates the pancreatic duct cells to secrete bicarbonate-rich fluid, which neutralizes gastric acid in the duodenum, creating an optimal pH for digestive enzyme activity. This aligns with the consensus that Secretin's primary role is to promote bicarbonate secretion, as supported by evidence paths indicating Secretin's effect on pancreatic fluid secretion and the role of the pancreas in bicarbonate production. While Secretin also has minor roles in inhibiting gastric acid secretion and affecting pyloric sphincter contraction, these are not its primary actions.\"\n}\n```",
