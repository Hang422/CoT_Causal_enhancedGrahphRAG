      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Physiology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Growth hormone has its effect on growth through?\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Directly\nopb. IG1-1\nopc. Thyroxine\nopd. Intranuclear receptors\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Growth hormone\" -> \"stimulates liver to produce IGF-1\" -> \"IGF-1 promotes growth in tissues\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Growth hormone\" -> \"binds to receptors on target cells\" -> \"activates signaling pathways\" -> \"increased cell proliferation\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Growth hormone\" -> \"influences metabolism\" -> \"increased protein synthesis\" -> \"enhanced growth\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Growth hormone\" -> \"directly affects growth plates\" -> \"stimulates chondrocyte activity\" -> \"increased bone length\" -> 80%\nCHAIN: \"Growth hormone\" -> \"interacts with intranuclear receptors\" -> \"modulates gene expression\" -> \"increased growth factors\" -> 70%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Somatotropin)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Leptocyte)\n(Somatotropin)-CAUSES->(glucose homeostasis)-PROCESS_OF->(Liver)\n(Somatotropin)-CAUSES->(Coagulation process)-PROCESS_OF->(Liver)\n(Somatotropin)-CAUSES->(Puberty)-PROCESS_OF->(Liver)\n(Somatotropin)-CAUSES->(uptake)-PROCESS_OF->(Epiphysial cartilage)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Growth hormone primarily exerts its effects on growth through the stimulation of the liver to produce Insulin-like Growth Factor 1 (IGF-1), which then promotes growth in various tissues. This is the most widely accepted mechanism, aligning with the consensus that IGF-1 is a key mediator of growth hormone's effects. The reasoning chain that growth hormone directly affects growth plates or interacts with intranuclear receptors is less supported by consensus, as growth hormone typically acts through cell surface receptors and not directly through intranuclear receptors. The retrieved evidence paths, such as somatotropin causing processes in the liver, support the role of the liver in mediating growth hormone's effects, consistent with the production of IGF-1. Therefore, option 'opb. IG1-1' is the most accurate representation of how growth hormone influences growth.\"\n}\n```",
