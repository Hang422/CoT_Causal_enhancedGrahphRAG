      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Propronolol is useful in all except -\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Atrial flutter\nopb. Parkinsonian tremor\nopc. Thyrotoxicosis\nopd. HOCM\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Propranolol is a beta-blocker\" -> \"used to manage heart rhythm disorders\" -> \"effective in atrial flutter\" -> \"not indicated for Parkinsonian tremor\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Propranolol reduces sympathetic nervous system activity\" -> \"beneficial in thyrotoxicosis\" -> \"helps control symptoms like tachycardia\" -> \"not primarily used for HOCM\" -> 80%\nCHAIN: \"Propranolol is effective for anxiety and tremors\" -> \"used in conditions like thyrotoxicosis\" -> \"less effective for Parkinsonian tremor\" -> \"not a first-line treatment\" -> 75%\nCHAIN: \"Propranolol is indicated for HOCM\" -> \"reduces left ventricular outflow obstruction\" -> \"also used in atrial flutter\" -> \"not effective for Parkinsonian tremor\" -> 70%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Atrial Flutter)-CAUSES->(Cerebrovascular accident)-CAUSES->(Parkinsonian tremor)\n(Thyrotoxicosis)-CAUSES->(Tremor)-CAUSES->(Parkinsonian tremor)\n(Thyrotoxicosis)-CAUSES->(Cerebrovascular accident)-CAUSES->(Parkinsonian tremor)\n(Thyrotoxicosis)-CAUSES->(Fatigue)-CAUSES->(Parkinsonian tremor)\n(cardiac arrhythmia)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Atrial Flutter)\n(Tremor)-CAUSES->(Disease)-CAUSES->(Thyrotoxicosis)\n(Tremor)-CAUSES->(Syndrome)-CAUSES->(Thyrotoxicosis)\n(Tremor)-CAUSES->(Infection)-COMPLICATES->(Thyrotoxicosis)\n(Ventricular Outflow Obstruction, Left)-CAUSES->(Hypertensive disease)-CAUSES->(Atrial Flutter)\n(Ventricular Outflow Obstruction, Left)-CAUSES->(Heart failure)-COMPLICATES->(Atrial Flutter)\n(Parkinsonian tremor)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Disease)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(physiological aspects)-PROCESS_OF->(Bone Marrow)-LOCATION_OF->(First line treatment)\n(Parkinsonian tremor)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Parkinson Disease)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(physiological aspects)-PROCESS_OF->(Bone Marrow)-LOCATION_OF->(First line treatment)\n(Propranolol)-TREATS->(Thyrotoxicosis)\n(Thyrotoxicosis)-CAUSES->(Tachycardia)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Propranolol is a non-selective beta-blocker commonly used to manage cardiovascular conditions. It is effective in treating atrial flutter by controlling heart rate and reducing arrhythmias. In thyrotoxicosis, propranolol helps alleviate symptoms such as tachycardia due to its ability to reduce sympathetic nervous system activity. However, propranolol is not effective for Parkinsonian tremor, as it is not a dopaminergic agent and does not address the underlying pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease. While propranolol can be used in hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM) to reduce left ventricular outflow obstruction, it is not the primary treatment choice. Therefore, propranolol is useful in atrial flutter, thyrotoxicosis, and HOCM, but not in Parkinsonian tremor.\"\n}\n```",
