      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Which among the following NOT a pharmacological action of opioids\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Cough suppression\nopb. Anti-emesis\nopc. Miosis\nopd. Truncal rigidity\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Opioids\" -> \"known to suppress cough\" -> \"cough suppression is a pharmacological action\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Opioids\" -> \"can cause nausea\" -> \"anti-emetic properties are utilized\" -> \"anti-emesis is a pharmacological action\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Opioids\" -> \"cause constriction of pupils\" -> \"miosis is a pharmacological action\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Opioids\" -> \"can cause truncal rigidity\" -> \"truncal rigidity is a pharmacological action\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Opioids\" -> \"not primarily used for anti-emesis\" -> \"anti-emesis is not a primary action\" -> \"possible confusion with other medications\" -> 70%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Analgesics, Opioid)-CAUSES->(Nausea)\n(Pupil)-LOCATION_OF->(Miosis disorder)\n(Constriction procedure)-CAUSES->(Disease)-CAUSES->(Ocular-Ophthalmoplegia, Sympathetic)-CAUSES->(Miosis disorder)\n(Constriction procedure)-CAUSES->(Stenosis)-CAUSES->(Ocular-Ophthalmoplegia, Sympathetic)-CAUSES->(Miosis disorder)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Opioids are known to have several pharmacological actions. They are effective in suppressing cough, which aligns with their use in cough suppression. Opioids also cause miosis, or pupil constriction, which is a well-documented effect. Truncal rigidity is another recognized pharmacological action of opioids, particularly at high doses or with certain potent opioids. However, opioids are not primarily used for anti-emesis; in fact, they often cause nausea and vomiting, which contradicts the claim of anti-emetic properties. The evidence paths confirm the association of opioids with nausea and miosis, supporting the consensus that anti-emesis is not a pharmacological action of opioids. Therefore, the correct answer is that anti-emesis is not a pharmacological action of opioids.\"\n}\n```",
