      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Which of the following drugs is useful in prophylaxis of motion sickness?\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Hyoscine\nopb. Metoclopramide\nopc. Prochlorperazine\nopd. Ondansetron\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Hyoscine\" -> \"anticholinergic properties\" -> \"prevention of nausea and vomiting\" -> \"useful in motion sickness prophylaxis\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Metoclopramide\" -> \"dopamine antagonist\" -> \"increases gastric motility\" -> \"not primarily used for motion sickness\" -> 70%\nCHAIN: \"Prochlorperazine\" -> \"antipsychotic with antiemetic effects\" -> \"used for nausea and vomiting\" -> \"not first-line for motion sickness\" -> 75%\nCHAIN: \"Ondansetron\" -> \"serotonin receptor antagonist\" -> \"effective for chemotherapy-induced nausea\" -> \"not typically used for motion sickness\" -> 65%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Metoclopramide)-TREATS->(Epilepsy)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(physiological aspects)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Dopamine Antagonists)\n(Ondansetron)-TREATS->(Disease)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Sleep, Slow-Wave)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Serotonin Antagonists)\n(Scopolamine)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Anticholinergic Agents)\n(Ondansetron)-ISA->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Serotonin Uptake Inhibitors)-ISA->(Serotonin Antagonists)\n(Antiemetic Effect)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-CAUSES/TREATS->([D]Nausea and vomiting NOS)\n(Metoclopramide)-TREATS->(Functional disorder)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(physiological aspects)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Dopamine Antagonists)\n(Prochlorperazine)-TREATS->(Icterus)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Genes)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Antipsychotic Agents)\n(Prochlorperazine)-TREATS->(Adverse effects)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(CYP2D6 gene|CYP2D6)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Antipsychotic Agents)\n(Prophylactic treatment)-CAUSES->(Adverse effects)-CAUSES->(Motion Sickness)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Hyoscine, also known as scopolamine, is an anticholinergic agent that is well-established in the prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with motion sickness, making it the drug of choice for motion sickness prophylaxis. The evidence path confirms its interaction with anticholinergic agents, supporting its use in this context. Metoclopramide, a dopamine antagonist, primarily increases gastric motility and is not typically used for motion sickness. Prochlorperazine, an antipsychotic with antiemetic effects, is used for general nausea and vomiting but is not a first-line treatment for motion sickness. Ondansetron, a serotonin receptor antagonist, is effective for chemotherapy-induced nausea but not typically used for motion sickness. Therefore, Hyoscine is the most appropriate option for motion sickness prophylaxis.\"\n}\n```",
