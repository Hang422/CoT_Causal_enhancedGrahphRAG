      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Biochemistry.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Glycogen storage diseases include all the following except:\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Krabbe's disease\nopb. Fabry's disease\nopc. Fragile syndrome\nopd. All\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Glycogen storage diseases\" -> \"involve abnormal glycogen metabolism\" -> \"include conditions like Pompe disease and McArdle disease\" -> \"Krabbe's disease is a lysosomal storage disorder\" -> \"not classified as a glycogen storage disease\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Glycogen storage diseases\" -> \"are characterized by enzyme deficiencies\" -> \"Fabry's disease is a sphingolipidosis\" -> \"not related to glycogen metabolism\" -> \"therefore not a glycogen storage disease\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Glycogen storage diseases\" -> \"are distinct from other metabolic disorders\" -> \"Fragile X syndrome is a genetic condition\" -> \"not related to glycogen storage\" -> \"thus not a glycogen storage disease\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Glycogen storage diseases\" -> \"include various metabolic disorders\" -> \"Krabbe's disease is not one of them\" -> \"Fabry's disease is also excluded\" -> \"Fragile X syndrome is unrelated\" -> \"therefore, all options are not glycogen storage diseases\" -> 80%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Glycogen storage disease type II)-CAUSES->(Functional disorder)-CAUSES->(Globoid cell leukodystrophy)\n(Glycogen Storage Disease Type V)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Functional disorder)-CAUSES->(Globoid cell leukodystrophy)\n(Globoid cell leukodystrophy)-CAUSES->(Disease)-CAUSES->(Fabry Disease)\n(Globoid cell leukodystrophy)-CAUSES->(Functional disorder)-CAUSES->(Fabry Disease)\n(Globoid cell leukodystrophy)-CAUSES->(Lysosomal Storage Diseases)-CAUSES->(Fabry Disease)\n(Fabry Disease)-CAUSES->(Disease)-CAUSES->(Fragile X Syndrome)\n(Fabry Disease)-CAUSES->(Pathogenesis)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Fragile X Syndrome)\n(Globoid cell leukodystrophy)-CAUSES->(Disease)-CAUSES->(Cerebral atrophy)-CAUSES->(Glycogen Storage Disease)\n(Globoid cell leukodystrophy)-CAUSES->(Neurodegenerative Disorders)-CAUSES->(Cerebral atrophy)-CAUSES->(Glycogen Storage Disease)\n(Globoid cell leukodystrophy)-CAUSES->(Demyelination)-CAUSES->(Cerebral atrophy)-CAUSES->(Glycogen Storage Disease)\n(Fragile X Syndrome)-CAUSES->(Disease)-CAUSES->(Cerebral atrophy)-CAUSES->(Glycogen Storage Disease)\n(Fragile X Syndrome)-PREDISPOSES->(Hypertensive disease)-CAUSES->(Cerebral atrophy)-CAUSES->(Glycogen Storage Disease)\n(Fragile X Syndrome)-PREDISPOSES->(Alzheimer's Disease)-CAUSES->(Cerebral atrophy)-CAUSES->(Glycogen Storage Disease)\n(Enzyme Deficiency)-CAUSES->(Fabry Disease)\n(Glycogen Storage Disease)-CAUSES->(Metabolic Diseases)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Glycogen storage diseases are characterized by abnormal glycogen metabolism and enzyme deficiencies affecting glycogen synthesis or breakdown. Krabbe's disease is a lysosomal storage disorder, not a glycogen storage disease. Fabry's disease is a sphingolipidosis, unrelated to glycogen metabolism, and thus not a glycogen storage disease. Fragile X syndrome is a genetic condition affecting the FMR1 gene, not related to glycogen storage. Therefore, none of the options (Krabbe's disease, Fabry's disease, Fragile X syndrome) are classified as glycogen storage diseases. The evidence paths provided do not directly support any of these conditions being glycogen storage diseases, confirming the consensus that all options are not glycogen storage diseases.\"\n}\n```",
