      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Biochemistry.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Starvation and diabetes mellitus can lead on to ketoacidosis which of the following features is in our of ketoacidosis due to diabetes mellitus.\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Increase in glucagon/insulin ratio, increased CAMP and increased blood glucose\nopb. Decreased insulin, increased free fatty acid which is equivalent to blood glucose\nopc. Decreased insulin, increased free fatty acid which is not equivalent to blood glucose\nopd. Elevated insulin and free fatty acid, equivalent to blood glucose\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Diabetes mellitus\" -> \"decreased insulin secretion\" -> \"increased glucagon/insulin ratio\" -> \"increased cAMP levels\" -> \"increased blood glucose\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Diabetes mellitus\" -> \"decreased insulin\" -> \"increased free fatty acids\" -> \"not equivalent to blood glucose\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Diabetes mellitus\" -> \"decreased insulin\" -> \"increased free fatty acids\" -> \"not equivalent to blood glucose\" -> \"possible confusion with metabolic state\" -> 70%\nCHAIN: \"Diabetes mellitus\" -> \"elevated insulin levels\" -> \"increased free fatty acids\" -> \"equivalent to blood glucose\" -> \"conflicts with typical ketoacidosis presentation\" -> 60%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Diabetes Mellitus)-CAUSES/PREDISPOSES->(Pathogenesis)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Insulin)\n(Insulin)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Fatty Acids, Nonesterified)\n(Blood Glucose)-CAUSES->(Diabetes Mellitus, Insulin-Dependent)-COMPLICATES->(Ketosis)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"In ketoacidosis due to diabetes mellitus, the key feature is a decreased insulin level leading to an increased glucagon/insulin ratio. This results in elevated cAMP levels and increased blood glucose, which aligns with the pathophysiology of diabetic ketoacidosis. The retrieved evidence supports the interaction between insulin and nonesterified fatty acids, which are elevated due to decreased insulin, contributing to the metabolic state. Option 'opa' correctly reflects this consensus, as it describes the increased glucagon/insulin ratio, increased cAMP, and increased blood glucose, which are characteristic of diabetic ketoacidosis. Options 'opb' and 'opc' correctly note the increase in free fatty acids due to decreased insulin, but 'opc' more accurately reflects that these fatty acids are not equivalent to blood glucose. Option 'opd' is incorrect as elevated insulin is not typical in diabetic ketoacidosis.\"\n}\n```",
