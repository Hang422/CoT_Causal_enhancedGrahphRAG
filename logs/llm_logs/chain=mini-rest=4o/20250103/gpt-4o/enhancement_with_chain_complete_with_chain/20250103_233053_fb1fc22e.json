      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Drug of choice for peptic ulcer disease caused by chronic use of NSAIDS:\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Pirenzepine\nopb. Loratadine\nopc. Misoprostol\nopd. Esomeprazole\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Chronic NSAID use\" -> \"increased gastric acid secretion\" -> \"mucosal damage\" -> \"peptic ulcer disease\" -> \"Misoprostol indicated for prevention\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Chronic NSAID use\" -> \"inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis\" -> \"reduced mucosal protection\" -> \"peptic ulcer disease\" -> \"Misoprostol provides mucosal protection\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Peptic ulcer disease\" -> \"NSAID-induced\" -> \"prostaglandin analogs beneficial\" -> \"Misoprostol as drug of choice\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Peptic ulcer disease\" -> \"caused by NSAIDs\" -> \"need for mucosal protection\" -> \"Misoprostol indicated\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Chronic NSAID use\" -> \"risk of peptic ulcer disease\" -> \"Misoprostol can reduce risk\" -> \"considered drug of choice\" -> 80%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Peptic Ulcer)-CAUSES/ISA->(Disease)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Excretory function)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Misoprostol)\n(Misoprostol)-ISA->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)\n(Peptic Ulcer)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Bacteria)-LOCATION_OF->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"The drug of choice for peptic ulcer disease caused by chronic NSAID use is Misoprostol. Chronic NSAID use leads to inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis, resulting in reduced mucosal protection and increased risk of peptic ulcer disease. Misoprostol, a prostaglandin analog, is effective in providing mucosal protection and preventing NSAID-induced ulcers. The retrieved evidence supports the association of Misoprostol with peptic ulcer management, confirming its role as a pharmaceutical preparation beneficial in this context. Other options, such as Pirenzepine, Loratadine, and Esomeprazole, do not align with the consensus for this specific indication.\"\n}\n```",
