      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Choose the drug which blocks basal as well as stimulated gastric acid secretion without affecting cholinergic, histaminergic or gastrin receptors\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Loxatidine\nopb. Pirenzepine\nopc. Omeprazole\nopd. Famotidine\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Loxatidine\" -> \"blocks H2 receptors\" -> \"reduces gastric acid secretion\" -> \"does not affect cholinergic, histaminergic, or gastrin receptors\" -> 70%\nCHAIN: \"Pirenzepine\" -> \"blocks M1 muscarinic receptors\" -> \"reduces gastric acid secretion\" -> \"does not block H2 receptors\" -> \"does not meet criteria\" -> 60%\nCHAIN: \"Omeprazole\" -> \"inhibits proton pump\" -> \"blocks stimulated gastric acid secretion\" -> \"does not affect cholinergic, histaminergic, or gastrin receptors\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Famotidine\" -> \"blocks H2 receptors\" -> \"reduces gastric acid secretion\" -> \"does not affect cholinergic, histaminergic, or gastrin receptors\" -> 80%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Pirenzepine)-TREATS->(Disease)-CAUSES/PREDISPOSES->(Obstruction)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Receptor, Muscarinic M1)\n(Obstruction)-CAUSES/PREDISPOSES->(Disease)-COMPLICATES->(Insulin Resistance)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Cholecystokinin B Receptor)\n(Famotidine)-TREATS->(Disease)-MANIFESTATION_OF/PREDISPOSES->(Pathogenesis)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Histamine H2 Receptors)\n(Omeprazole)-TREATS->(Disease)-CAUSES/MANIFESTATION_OF->(Metabolic acidosis)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Proton Pump)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Omeprazole is the drug that blocks both basal and stimulated gastric acid secretion by inhibiting the proton pump, which is the final step in acid production. This mechanism does not involve cholinergic, histaminergic, or gastrin receptors, aligning with the requirement of the question. The retrieved evidence path supports this by associating omeprazole with the proton pump, confirming its mechanism of action. Loxatidine and Famotidine both block H2 receptors, which reduces gastric acid secretion but does not meet the criteria of not affecting histaminergic receptors. Pirenzepine blocks M1 muscarinic receptors, which does not align with the requirement as it affects cholinergic receptors. Therefore, Omeprazole is the correct choice based on consensus and evidence.\"\n}\n```",
