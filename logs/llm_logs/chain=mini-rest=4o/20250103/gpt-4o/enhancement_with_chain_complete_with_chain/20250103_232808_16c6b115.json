      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Tocilizumab used against Rheumatoid arthritis is a monoclonal antibody against :\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Interleukin-6\nopb. Interleukin-6 receptor\nopc. Interleukin-5\nopd. Interleukin-5 receptor\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Tocilizumab is a monoclonal antibody\" -> \"targets specific cytokines\" -> \"Interleukin-6 is a cytokine\" -> \"Tocilizumab inhibits Interleukin-6\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Tocilizumab is used in rheumatoid arthritis\" -> \"rheumatoid arthritis involves inflammation\" -> \"Interleukin-6 contributes to inflammation\" -> \"Tocilizumab blocks Interleukin-6\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Tocilizumab is a targeted therapy\" -> \"it targets inflammatory mediators\" -> \"Interleukin-6 receptor is involved in signaling\" -> \"Tocilizumab binds to Interleukin-6 receptor\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Tocilizumab is an immunomodulator\" -> \"it modulates immune response\" -> \"Interleukin-5 is not primarily involved in rheumatoid arthritis\" -> \"Tocilizumab does not target Interleukin-5\" -> 80%\nCHAIN: \"Tocilizumab is indicated for autoimmune diseases\" -> \"Interleukin-6 plays a role in autoimmune diseases\" -> \"Tocilizumab is effective against Interleukin-6\" -> 90%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(tocilizumab)-TREATS->(Rheumatoid Arthritis)\n(Interleukin 6 Receptor)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cells)-INTERACTS_WITH->(tocilizumab)\n(Interleukin 6 Receptor)-INTERACTS_WITH->(B-Lymphocytes)-INTERACTS_WITH->(tocilizumab)\n(Rheumatoid Arthritis)-PREDISPOSES->(Complication)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(tocilizumab)\n(Rheumatoid Arthritis)-COMPLICATES->(Thrombosis)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(tocilizumab)\n(tocilizumab)-TREATS->(Autoimmune Diseases)\n(Autoimmune Diseases)-CAUSES/MANIFESTATION_OF->(Complication)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(tocilizumab)\n(Interleukin-6)-6)->(Cells)-INTERACTS_WITH->(tocilizumab)\n(Interleukin-6)-6)->(Complication)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(tocilizumab)\n(Interleukin-5)-5)->(Cells)-INTERACTS_WITH->(tocilizumab)\n(tocilizumab)-CAUSES->(Immunity)\n(Inflammation)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(tocilizumab)\n(tocilizumab)-INTERACTS_WITH->(T-Lymphocyte)-INTERACTS_WITH->(cytokine)\n(tocilizumab)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(cytokine)\n(cytokine)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cells)-INTERACTS_WITH->(tocilizumab)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Tocilizumab is a monoclonal antibody that specifically targets the Interleukin-6 receptor, not Interleukin-6 itself. This is consistent with its mechanism of action in treating rheumatoid arthritis, where it inhibits the signaling pathway of Interleukin-6, a cytokine involved in inflammation. The retrieved evidence supports this by showing interactions between tocilizumab and the Interleukin-6 receptor, as well as its use in treating autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis. Therefore, the correct target of tocilizumab is the Interleukin-6 receptor, aligning with standard medical consensus.\"\n}\n```",
