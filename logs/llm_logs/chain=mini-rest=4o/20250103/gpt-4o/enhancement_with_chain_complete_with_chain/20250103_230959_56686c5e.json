      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Valproic acid causes all EXCEPT\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. It is an enzyme inducer\nopb. It causes obesity\nopc. It causes Hirsutism\nopd. It causes neural tube defects\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Valproic acid\" -> \"known to cause weight gain\" -> \"associated with obesity\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Valproic acid\" -> \"can cause hirsutism\" -> \"increased hair growth in women\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Valproic acid\" -> \"known teratogen\" -> \"associated with neural tube defects\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Valproic acid\" -> \"not an enzyme inducer\" -> \"it is an enzyme inhibitor\" -> 80%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Valproic Acid)-CAUSES->(Polycystic Ovary Syndrome)-CAUSES->(Hirsutism)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Valproic acid is not an enzyme inducer; it is actually an enzyme inhibitor, which aligns with standard pharmacological consensus. It is known to cause weight gain, which can be associated with obesity. Valproic acid is a known teratogen and is associated with neural tube defects. While the retrieved evidence path suggests a link between valproic acid and hirsutism through polycystic ovary syndrome, this is not a direct or common effect of valproic acid itself. Therefore, the correct answer is that valproic acid does not cause hirsutism as a primary effect.\"\n}\n```",
