      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Which of the following drugs is contraindicated along with spironolactone\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Chlorothiazide\nopb. Beta blockers\nopc. ACE inhibitors\nopd. Amlodipine\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Spironolactone\" -> \"potassium-sparing diuretic\" -> \"increases potassium levels\" -> \"risk of hyperkalemia\" -> \"Chlorothiazide is a thiazide diuretic\" -> \"Chlorothiazide decreases potassium levels\" -> \"Chlorothiazide is not contraindicated\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Spironolactone\" -> \"potassium-sparing diuretic\" -> \"increases potassium levels\" -> \"risk of hyperkalemia\" -> \"Beta blockers do not significantly affect potassium levels\" -> \"Beta blockers are not contraindicated\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Spironolactone\" -> \"potassium-sparing diuretic\" -> \"increases potassium levels\" -> \"risk of hyperkalemia\" -> \"ACE inhibitors can also increase potassium levels\" -> \"ACE inhibitors may be contraindicated\" -> 75%\nCHAIN: \"Spironolactone\" -> \"potassium-sparing diuretic\" -> \"increases potassium levels\" -> \"risk of hyperkalemia\" -> \"Amlodipine does not affect potassium levels\" -> \"Amlodipine is not contraindicated\" -> 90%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(hyperkalemia)-CAUSES->(Disease)-CAUSES->(Obstetric Labor, Premature)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Amlodipine)\n(hyperkalemia)-ISA->(Symptoms)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Obstetric Labor, Premature)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Amlodipine)\n(hyperkalemia)-CAUSES->(Disease)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Excretory function)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Thiazide Diuretics)\n(hyperkalemia)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Lisinopril)-CAUSES->(Excretory function)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Thiazide Diuretics)\n(Thiazide Diuretics)-INTERACTS_WITH/ISA->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Hormones)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Chlorothiazide)\n(hyperkalemia)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(SGK1)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Adrenergic beta-Antagonists)\n(hyperkalemia)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(ADRBK1 gene|GRK2)-ISA->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Adrenergic beta-Antagonists)\n(Spironolactone)-ISA->(Potassium Sparing Diuretics)\n(Serum potassium assay)-DIAGNOSES->(Disease)-CAUSES->(Obstetric Labor, Premature)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Amlodipine)\n(Serum potassium assay)-DIAGNOSES->(Asthma)-PREDISPOSES->(Obstetric Labor, Premature)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Amlodipine)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Spironolactone is a potassium-sparing diuretic that increases potassium levels, posing a risk of hyperkalemia. ACE inhibitors, like spironolactone, can also increase potassium levels, making their concurrent use potentially contraindicated due to the increased risk of hyperkalemia. Chlorothiazide, a thiazide diuretic, typically decreases potassium levels and is not contraindicated with spironolactone. Beta blockers do not significantly affect potassium levels and are generally not contraindicated. Amlodipine, a calcium channel blocker, does not affect potassium levels and is not contraindicated with spironolactone. Therefore, the most consensus-aligned contraindication is with ACE inhibitors due to the risk of hyperkalemia.\"\n}\n```",
