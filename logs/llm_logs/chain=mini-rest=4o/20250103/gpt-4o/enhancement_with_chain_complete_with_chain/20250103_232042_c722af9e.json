      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Heparin is the commonly used anticoagulant in cardiac surgery. All of the following are true about heparin except-\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Weakest acid found in living things\nopb. Most commercial preparations of heparin now utilize pig intestinal slimes\nopc. Act via Antithrombin activation\nopd. Produce thrombocytopenia\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Heparin is an anticoagulant\" -> \"Inhibits thrombin and factor Xa\" -> \"Acts via Antithrombin activation\" -> \"True statement\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Heparin is derived from animal sources\" -> \"Most commercial preparations utilize pig intestinal mucosa\" -> \"True statement\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Heparin can cause a decrease in platelet count\" -> \"This condition is known as thrombocytopenia\" -> \"True statement\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Heparin is a polysaccharide\" -> \"It is not classified as an acid\" -> \"Weakest acid found in living things is incorrect\" -> 85%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Heparin)-CAUSES->(Thrombocytopenia)\n(Heparin)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Thrombin)\n(Heparin)-PART_OF->(Cells)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Thrombin)\n(Heparin)-PART_OF->(Cells)-PART_OF->(Intestinal Mucosa)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Heparin is a widely used anticoagulant in cardiac surgery. It acts by activating Antithrombin, which inhibits thrombin and factor Xa, confirming its anticoagulant mechanism (Option C is true). Most commercial heparin is derived from pig intestinal mucosa, aligning with standard production practices (Option B is true). Heparin can cause thrombocytopenia, a condition characterized by a decrease in platelet count, which is a known side effect (Option D is true). However, heparin is a polysaccharide and not classified as an acid, making the statement that it is the 'weakest acid found in living things' incorrect (Option A is false). The retrieved evidence paths support these points by confirming heparin's interaction with thrombin and its derivation from intestinal mucosa, while also noting its potential to cause thrombocytopenia.\"\n}\n```",
