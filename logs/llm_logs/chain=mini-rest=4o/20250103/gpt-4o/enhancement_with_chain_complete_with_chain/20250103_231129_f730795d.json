      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Biochemistry.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        The major vitamin deficiency in Wernicke's encephalopathy is :\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. B1\nopb. B2\nopc. B6\nopd. B12\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Wernicke's encephalopathy\" -> \"associated with thiamine deficiency\" -> \"thiamine is vitamin B1\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Wernicke's encephalopathy\" -> \"characterized by confusion and ataxia\" -> \"thiamine deficiency is a known cause\" -> \"thiamine is vitamin B1\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Wernicke's encephalopathy\" -> \"often seen in chronic alcoholism\" -> \"alcoholism leads to poor nutrition\" -> \"thiamine deficiency is common\" -> \"thiamine is vitamin B1\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Wernicke's encephalopathy\" -> \"can result from malabsorption syndromes\" -> \"malabsorption can lead to vitamin deficiencies\" -> \"thiamine deficiency is significant\" -> \"thiamine is vitamin B1\" -> 90%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Wernicke Encephalopathy)-CAUSES->(Beriberi)\n(Wernicke Encephalopathy)-CAUSES->(Ataxia)\n(Wernicke Encephalopathy)-CAUSES->(Shock)-COMPLICATES->(Alcoholic Intoxication, Chronic)\n(Wernicke Encephalopathy)-CAUSES->(Thiamine Deficiency)-COMPLICATES->(Alcoholic Intoxication, Chronic)\n(Wernicke Encephalopathy)-CAUSES->(Disease)-PREDISPOSES->(Alcoholic Intoxication, Chronic)\n(Wernicke Encephalopathy)-CAUSES->(Disease)-CAUSES->(Malabsorption Syndromes)\n(Wernicke Encephalopathy)-CAUSES->(Symptoms)-CAUSES->(Malabsorption Syndromes)\n(Wernicke Encephalopathy)-CAUSES->(Edema)-CAUSES->(Malabsorption Syndromes)\n(Ataxia)-CAUSES->(Beriberi)\n(Alcoholic Intoxication, Chronic)-CAUSES->(Malnutrition)\n(Alcoholic Intoxication, Chronic)-CAUSES->(Beriberi)\n(Malnutrition)-CAUSES->(Beriberi)\n(Malabsorption Syndromes)-CAUSES->(Vitamin A Deficiency)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Wernicke's encephalopathy is primarily associated with a deficiency in thiamine, which is vitamin B1. This condition is often linked to chronic alcoholism, which can lead to poor nutrition and thiamine deficiency. The retrieved evidence supports this by showing that Wernicke's encephalopathy is caused by thiamine deficiency and is complicated by chronic alcoholic intoxication. Other evidence paths, such as those linking Wernicke's encephalopathy to malabsorption syndromes, also align with the consensus that thiamine deficiency is significant in this condition. Therefore, the major vitamin deficiency in Wernicke's encephalopathy is vitamin B1.\"\n}\n```",
