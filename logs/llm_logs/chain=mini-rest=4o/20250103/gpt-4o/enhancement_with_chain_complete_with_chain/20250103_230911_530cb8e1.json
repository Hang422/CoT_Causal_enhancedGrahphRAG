      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Hypothyroidism is caused by which of the following anti-tubercular drug -\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. PAS\nopb. Ethionamide\nopc. Cycloserine\nopd. Pyrazinamide\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Ethionamide\" -> \"inhibits thyroid hormone synthesis\" -> \"decreased levels of T3 and T4\" -> \"hypothyroidism\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"PAS\" -> \"interferes with thyroid function\" -> \"possible decrease in thyroid hormone production\" -> \"hypothyroidism\" -> 70%\nCHAIN: \"Cycloserine\" -> \"unclear effect on thyroid function\" -> \"no established link to hypothyroidism\" -> \"hypothyroidism unlikely\" -> 40%\nCHAIN: \"Pyrazinamide\" -> \"no direct effect on thyroid hormone synthesis\" -> \"hypothyroidism unlikely\" -> 30%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Thyroxine)-CAUSES->(Hypothyroidism)\n(Triiodothyronine)-PREVENTS->(Hypothyroidism)\n(thyroid function)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Thyrotropin)-TREATS->(Hypothyroidism)\n(p-Aminosalicylic Acid)-TREATS->(Disease)-CAUSES->(Heart failure)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(thyroid function)\n(p-Aminosalicylic Acid)-TREATS->(Renal Insufficiency)-CAUSES->(Heart failure)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(thyroid function)\n(p-Aminosalicylic Acid)-TREATS->(Symptoms)-CAUSES->(Heart failure)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(thyroid function)\n(Cycloserine)-CAUSES->(Symptoms)-CAUSES->(Heart failure)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(thyroid function)\n(Cycloserine)-CAUSES->(Sleeplessness)-CAUSES->(Heart failure)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(thyroid function)\n(Cycloserine)-CAUSES->(Extravasation)-CAUSES->(Heart failure)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(thyroid function)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Ethionamide is known to inhibit thyroid hormone synthesis, leading to decreased levels of T3 and T4, which can cause hypothyroidism. This aligns with the consensus that ethionamide can induce hypothyroidism. PAS (p-Aminosalicylic Acid) has been suggested to interfere with thyroid function, but the evidence is less direct and not as strongly supported by consensus, making it a less likely cause of hypothyroidism. Cycloserine and Pyrazinamide do not have established links to hypothyroidism, as they do not directly affect thyroid hormone synthesis or function. Therefore, ethionamide is the most likely anti-tubercular drug to cause hypothyroidism based on current medical consensus.\"\n}\n```",
