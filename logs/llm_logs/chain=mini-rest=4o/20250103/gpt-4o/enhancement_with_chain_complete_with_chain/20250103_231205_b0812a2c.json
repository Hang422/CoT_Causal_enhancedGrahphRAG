      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Which of the following diuretics is contraindicated in the presence of cardiac failure?\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Mannitol\nopb. Spironolactone\nopc. Furosemide\nopd. Hydrochlorothiazide\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Mannitol\" -> \"osmotic diuretic\" -> \"increases intravascular volume\" -> \"may worsen cardiac failure\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Spironolactone\" -> \"potassium-sparing diuretic\" -> \"used in heart failure\" -> \"reduces mortality\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Furosemide\" -> \"loop diuretic\" -> \"commonly used in heart failure\" -> \"reduces fluid overload\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Hydrochlorothiazide\" -> \"thiazide diuretic\" -> \"not first-line for heart failure\" -> \"may be used cautiously\" -> 70%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Thiazide Diuretics)-TREATS->(Heart failure)\n(Potassium Sparing Diuretics)-TREATS->(Heart failure)\n(Mannitol)-INTERACTS_WITH/ISA->(Diuretics, Osmotic)\n(Spironolactone)-ISA->(Potassium Sparing Diuretics)\n(Hydrochlorothiazide)-ISA->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Thiazide Diuretics)\n(Hydrochlorothiazide)-CAUSES->(Excretory function)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Thiazide Diuretics)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Mannitol is an osmotic diuretic that increases intravascular volume, which can exacerbate cardiac failure, making it contraindicated in such cases. Spironolactone, a potassium-sparing diuretic, is used in heart failure to reduce mortality and is not contraindicated. Furosemide, a loop diuretic, is commonly used to manage fluid overload in heart failure, aligning with standard treatment practices. Hydrochlorothiazide, a thiazide diuretic, is not typically first-line for heart failure but may be used cautiously. The evidence paths confirm that potassium-sparing diuretics and thiazide diuretics can treat heart failure, while mannitol's role as an osmotic diuretic supports its contraindication in cardiac failure due to potential volume overload.\"\n}\n```",
