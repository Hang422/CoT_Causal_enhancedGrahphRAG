Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Cholesterol from the liver is transpoed to the peripheral tissue mainly by:\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. HDL\nopb. LDL\nopc. VLDL\nopd. Chylomicrons\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Cholesterol is synthesized in the liver\" -> \"Cholesterol needs to be transported to peripheral tissues\" -> \"LDL is the primary carrier of cholesterol in the bloodstream\" -> \"LDL delivers cholesterol to peripheral tissues\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Liver produces cholesterol\" -> \"Cholesterol is packaged into lipoproteins\" -> \"LDL is formed from VLDL after triglyceride removal\" -> \"LDL transports cholesterol to cells\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Cholesterol is produced in the liver\" -> \"Cholesterol is transported via lipoproteins\" -> \"VLDL primarily carries triglycerides\" -> \"LDL is responsible for cholesterol delivery\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Cholesterol is synthesized in the liver\" -> \"Cholesterol is transported in the bloodstream\" -> \"HDL primarily removes excess cholesterol\" -> \"LDL is the main transporter of cholesterol to tissues\" -> 80%\nCHAIN: \"Cholesterol is produced in the liver\" -> \"Cholesterol is released into the bloodstream\" -> \"Chylomicrons transport dietary lipids\" -> \"LDL is the main transporter of liver-derived cholesterol\" -> 75%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Liver)-LOCATION_OF->(Pathogenesis)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Lipoproteins)\n(Liver)-LOCATION_OF->(Fatty degeneration)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Lipoproteins)\n(Triglycerides)-PART_OF->(Cells)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Low-Density Lipoproteins)\n(Triglycerides)-PART_OF->(Cultured Cells)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Low-Density Lipoproteins)\n(Lipoproteins)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cells)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Very low density lipoprotein)\n(Lipoproteins)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Lymphocyte)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Very low density lipoprotein)\n(Very low density lipoprotein)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Adipocytes)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Low-Density Lipoproteins)\n(Very low density lipoprotein)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Chinese Hamster Ovary Cell)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Low-Density Lipoproteins)\n(Triglycerides)-TREATS->(Diabetes)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(GLUCOSE TOLERANCE)-PROCESS_OF->(Cells)\n(Triglycerides)-TREATS->(impaired glucose tolerance)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(GLUCOSE TOLERANCE)-PROCESS_OF->(Cells)\n(Blood Circulation)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-CAUSES/PREVENTS->(Diastasis)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Low-Density Lipoproteins)-Density Lipoproteins)\n(Lipoproteins)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cells)-PART_OF->(Fat pad)-LOCATION_OF->(removal technique)\n(Lipoproteins)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Endothelial Cells)-PART_OF->(Fat pad)-LOCATION_OF->(removal technique)\n(Low-Density Lipoproteins)-PREDISPOSES->(Myocardial Infarction)-CAUSES->(Diabetes)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(GLUCOSE TOLERANCE)-PROCESS_OF->(Cells)\n(Low-Density Lipoproteins)-TREATS->(Disease)-CAUSES->(Diabetes)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(GLUCOSE TOLERANCE)-PROCESS_OF->(Cells)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Cholesterol is synthesized in the liver and needs to be transported to peripheral tissues. The primary carrier of cholesterol in the bloodstream is Low-Density Lipoprotein (LDL), which delivers cholesterol to peripheral tissues. LDL is formed from Very Low-Density Lipoprotein (VLDL) after the removal of triglycerides. While VLDL primarily carries triglycerides, it is converted to LDL, which is responsible for cholesterol delivery. High-Density Lipoprotein (HDL) primarily functions to remove excess cholesterol from tissues and transport it back to the liver, not to deliver cholesterol to peripheral tissues. Chylomicrons are involved in the transport of dietary lipids, not liver-derived cholesterol. The evidence paths confirm the interaction of LDL with cells and its role in cholesterol transport, supporting the consensus that LDL is the main transporter of cholesterol from the liver to peripheral tissues.\"\n}\n```",
