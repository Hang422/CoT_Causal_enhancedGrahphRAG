      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Alpha la adrenergic blocker giving symptomatic relief in BPH?\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Tamsulosin\nopb. Prazosin\nopc. Oxazocin\nopd. Dolazoline\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Alpha-1 adrenergic blocker\" -> \"relaxes smooth muscle in the prostate\" -> \"reduces urinary obstruction\" -> \"symptomatic relief in BPH\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Tamsulosin\" -> \"selectively blocks alpha-1A receptors\" -> \"decreases resistance in the prostatic urethra\" -> \"improves urinary flow\" -> \"symptomatic relief in BPH\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Prazosin\" -> \"blocks alpha-1 adrenergic receptors\" -> \"causes vasodilation\" -> \"may improve urinary symptoms\" -> \"less selective for prostate\" -> \"possible symptomatic relief in BPH\" -> 70%\nCHAIN: \"Oxazocin\" -> \"alpha-1 adrenergic blocker\" -> \"relaxes smooth muscle\" -> \"potentially reduces urinary symptoms\" -> \"less commonly used\" -> \"unclear efficacy in BPH\" -> 60%\nCHAIN: \"Dolazoline\" -> \"alpha-2 adrenergic agonist\" -> \"not primarily used for BPH\" -> \"unclear role in urinary symptoms\" -> \"unlikely to provide symptomatic relief in BPH\" -> 50%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Prazosin)-TREATS->(Hypoxia)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Receptors, Adrenergic, alpha-1)\n(Central alpha-2 Adrenergic Agonist [EPC])-TREATS->(Sleep disturbances)-CAUSES->(Obesity)-CAUSES->(Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia)\n(Central alpha-2 Adrenergic Agonist [EPC])-PREVENTS->(Inflammation)-CAUSES->(Obesity)-CAUSES->(Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia)\n(Urinary tract obstruction)-CAUSES->(Lower urinary tract symptoms)-CAUSES->(Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia)\n(Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia)-CAUSES->(Urinary symptoms)\n(Prostate)-LOCATION_OF->(Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia)\n(Obstruction)-CAUSES->(Subarachnoid Hemorrhage)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Vasodilation)\n(Urinary tract obstruction)-CAUSES->(Chronic inflammation)-CAUSES->(Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia)\n(Urinary symptoms)-CAUSES->([D]Acute retention of urine)-CAUSES->(Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia)\n(Receptors, Adrenergic, alpha-1)-CAUSES->(Vasodilation)\n(Obstruction)-CAUSES->(Hypertensive disease)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Vasodilation)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Tamsulosin is a selective alpha-1A adrenergic blocker that relaxes smooth muscle in the prostate, reducing urinary obstruction and improving urinary flow, providing symptomatic relief in BPH. This aligns with the consensus that alpha-1 blockers are effective in treating BPH symptoms. Prazosin, while an alpha-1 blocker, is less selective for the prostate and primarily causes vasodilation, making it less effective for BPH compared to Tamsulosin. Oxazocin is an alpha-1 blocker but is less commonly used and has unclear efficacy in BPH. Dolazoline, being an alpha-2 adrenergic agonist, is not used for BPH and is unlikely to provide symptomatic relief. The evidence paths confirm that urinary tract obstruction leads to lower urinary tract symptoms associated with BPH, supporting the role of alpha-1 blockers in symptom relief.\"\n}\n```",
