      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Biochemistry.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Urine osmolality in Diabetes insipidus is\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. <150 mmol/L\nopb. <300 mmol/L\nopc. <600 mmol/L\nopd. <900 mmol/L\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Diabetes insipidus\" -> \"impaired water reabsorption\" -> \"dilute urine\" -> \"urine osmolality <300 mmol/L\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Diabetes insipidus\" -> \"deficiency of antidiuretic hormone (ADH)\" -> \"inability to concentrate urine\" -> \"urine osmolality <600 mmol/L\" -> 80%\nCHAIN: \"Diabetes insipidus\" -> \"excessive urination\" -> \"low urine concentration\" -> \"urine osmolality <150 mmol/L\" -> 70%\nCHAIN: \"Diabetes insipidus\" -> \"increased thirst and urination\" -> \"urine remains dilute\" -> \"urine osmolality <900 mmol/L\" -> 75%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Diabetes Insipidus)-CAUSES/COMPLICATES->(Disease)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Diastasis)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Alcohol dehydrogenase)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"In Diabetes insipidus, there is a deficiency of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) or a resistance to its effects, leading to impaired water reabsorption in the kidneys. This results in the production of large volumes of dilute urine. The standard medical consensus is that urine osmolality in Diabetes insipidus is typically low, often less than 300 mmol/L. The reasoning chain for option 'opb' aligns with this consensus, as it correctly identifies the inability to concentrate urine due to ADH deficiency, resulting in urine osmolality of less than 300 mmol/L. Other options suggesting higher osmolality values (e.g., <600 mmol/L or <900 mmol/L) do not align with the typical presentation of Diabetes insipidus. The retrieved evidence path, while broad, does not directly address urine osmolality and is not relevant to refining the consensus understanding of this condition.\"\n}\n```",
