      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Biochemistry.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Cardiomyopathy is/are due to deficinency of:\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Selenium\nopb. Phosphorus\nopc. Boron\nopd. Zinc\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Selenium deficiency\" -> \"increased oxidative stress\" -> \"myocardial damage\" -> \"possible cardiomyopathy\" -> 75%\nCHAIN: \"Zinc deficiency\" -> \"impaired immune function\" -> \"increased inflammation\" -> \"potential heart muscle damage\" -> \"possible cardiomyopathy\" -> 70%\nCHAIN: \"Phosphorus deficiency\" -> \"disrupted energy metabolism\" -> \"impaired cardiac function\" -> \"possible cardiomyopathy\" -> 65%\nCHAIN: \"Boron deficiency\" -> \"altered mineral metabolism\" -> \"potential cardiovascular effects\" -> \"unclear link to cardiomyopathy\" -> 50%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Cardiovascular system)-LOCATION_OF->(novel AODU treatment method)-TREATS->(Cardiomyopathies)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Selenium deficiency is well-documented to cause cardiomyopathy due to increased oxidative stress leading to myocardial damage. This aligns with the consensus that selenium is crucial for heart health, and its deficiency can directly lead to cardiomyopathy. Zinc deficiency can lead to impaired immune function and increased inflammation, which might contribute to heart muscle damage, but it is not a primary cause of cardiomyopathy. Phosphorus deficiency affects energy metabolism and cardiac function, but it is not a common cause of cardiomyopathy. Boron deficiency has unclear links to cardiomyopathy, as its role in cardiovascular health is not well-established. Therefore, selenium deficiency is the most directly linked to cardiomyopathy among the options provided.\"\n}\n```",
