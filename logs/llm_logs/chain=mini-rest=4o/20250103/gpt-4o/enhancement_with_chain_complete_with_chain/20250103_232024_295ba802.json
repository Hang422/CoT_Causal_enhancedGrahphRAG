      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Biochemistry.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Which of the following vitamin reduces the risk of insulin resistance, obesity, and the metabolic syndrome?\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Vitamin A\nopb. Vitamin C\nopc. Vitamin D\nopd. Vitamin B12\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Vitamin D\" -> \"enhanced insulin sensitivity\" -> \"reduced risk of insulin resistance\" -> \"lower incidence of obesity\" -> \"decreased metabolic syndrome risk\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Vitamin C\" -> \"antioxidant properties\" -> \"possible reduction in inflammation\" -> \"unclear impact on insulin resistance\" -> 60%\nCHAIN: \"Vitamin A\" -> \"role in immune function\" -> \"no direct evidence for insulin resistance\" -> \"unclear impact on obesity\" -> 50%\nCHAIN: \"Vitamin B12\" -> \"essential for energy metabolism\" -> \"no direct evidence for insulin resistance\" -> \"unclear impact on metabolic syndrome\" -> 55%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Vitamin D2)-TREATS->(Obesity)-CAUSES->(insulin sensitivity)\n(Vitamin D2)-PREDISPOSES->(Disease)-CAUSES->(insulin sensitivity)\n(Vitamin D2)-CAUSES->(Hypertensive disease)-PREDISPOSES->(insulin sensitivity)\n(Vitamin B 12)-TREATS->(Obesity)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Energy Metabolism)\n(Vitamin B 12)-TREATS->(Autoimmune Diseases)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Energy Metabolism)\n(Vitamin B 12)-TREATS->(Heart failure)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Energy Metabolism)\n(Insulin Resistance)-CAUSES->(Obesity)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Vitamin D is widely recognized for its role in enhancing insulin sensitivity, which can reduce the risk of insulin resistance, obesity, and metabolic syndrome. This aligns with evidence showing Vitamin D's involvement in improving insulin sensitivity and potentially reducing obesity-related risks. Vitamin C, while having antioxidant properties, lacks clear evidence directly linking it to reduced insulin resistance or metabolic syndrome. Vitamin A is primarily associated with immune function and does not have a direct impact on insulin resistance or obesity. Vitamin B12 is crucial for energy metabolism but does not have direct evidence supporting a role in reducing insulin resistance or metabolic syndrome. Therefore, Vitamin D is the most supported option for reducing the risk of insulin resistance, obesity, and metabolic syndrome.\"\n}\n```",
