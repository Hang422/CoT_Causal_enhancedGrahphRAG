      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Schizophrenia is treated by\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Anti depressants\nopb. Anti psychotics\nopc. Anti epileptics\nopd. Mood stabilizers\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Schizophrenia\" -> \"requires management of psychotic symptoms\" -> \"anti-psychotic medications are effective\" -> \"reduces hallucinations and delusions\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Schizophrenia\" -> \"characterized by psychosis\" -> \"anti-psychotics are the primary treatment\" -> \"improves overall functioning\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Schizophrenia\" -> \"often involves mood disturbances\" -> \"mood stabilizers may help\" -> \"not first-line treatment\" -> \"less effective than anti-psychotics\" -> 70%\nCHAIN: \"Schizophrenia\" -> \"can have comorbid conditions\" -> \"anti-depressants may be used\" -> \"not primary treatment for schizophrenia\" -> \"unclear efficacy\" -> 60%\nCHAIN: \"Schizophrenia\" -> \"may involve seizures in some cases\" -> \"anti-epileptics could be considered\" -> \"not standard treatment\" -> \"unclear role in management\" -> 50%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Schizophrenia)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(physiological aspects)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Oxygen)-TREATS->(Disturbance in mood)\n(Schizophrenia)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(physiological aspects)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Hydrocortisone)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Disturbance in mood)\n(Schizophrenia)-CAUSES->(Psychotic Disorders)\n(Schizophrenia)-CAUSES->(Disease)-CAUSES->(Psychotic symptom)\n(Schizophrenia)-CAUSES->(Infection)-CAUSES->(Psychotic symptom)\n(Schizophrenia)-CAUSES->(Symptoms)-CAUSES->(Psychotic symptom)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Schizophrenia is primarily treated with antipsychotic medications, which are effective in managing psychotic symptoms such as hallucinations and delusions. This aligns with the consensus that antipsychotics are the first-line treatment for schizophrenia, as they improve overall functioning by addressing the core psychotic symptoms. While mood disturbances can occur in schizophrenia, mood stabilizers are not the primary treatment and are less effective than antipsychotics. Antidepressants may be used to manage comorbid conditions like depression, but they are not the primary treatment for schizophrenia itself. Anti-epileptics are not standard in the treatment of schizophrenia, as their role is unclear and not supported by consensus. The retrieved evidence paths confirm that schizophrenia causes psychotic disorders and symptoms, supporting the use of antipsychotics as the main treatment approach.\"\n}\n```",
