      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Ivermectin is indicated in all of the following except:\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Ascaris\nopb. Filariasis\nopc. Malaria\nopd. Oncocerciasis\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Ivermectin is an antiparasitic medication\" -> \"effective against certain parasitic infections\" -> \"indicated for Onchocerciasis\" -> \"indicated for Filariasis\" -> \"not indicated for Malaria\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Ivermectin treats various parasitic infections\" -> \"approved for use in Onchocerciasis\" -> \"approved for use in Filariasis\" -> \"not effective against Plasmodium species\" -> \"Malaria is caused by Plasmodium\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Ivermectin is used for specific parasitic diseases\" -> \"effective for Ascaris\" -> \"effective for Onchocerciasis\" -> \"effective for Filariasis\" -> \"ineffective for Malaria\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Ivermectin is indicated for certain infections\" -> \"indicated for Onchocerciasis\" -> \"indicated for Filariasis\" -> \"not indicated for Malaria\" -> \"Malaria requires different treatment\" -> 92%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Ivermectin)-TREATS->(Parasitic Diseases)\n(Ivermectin)-TREATS->(Onchocerciasis)\n(Filariasis)-CAUSES->(Disease)-CAUSES->(Malaria)\n(Filariasis)-CAUSES->(Symptoms)-CAUSES->(Malaria)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Ivermectin is an antiparasitic medication indicated for certain parasitic infections. It is effective and approved for use in treating Onchocerciasis and Filariasis, as supported by the evidence path (Ivermectin)-TREATS->(Onchocerciasis). Ivermectin is also effective against Ascaris infections. However, it is not effective against Malaria, which is caused by Plasmodium species, and requires different treatment. The retrieved evidence paths confirm that Ivermectin treats parasitic diseases but do not support its use for Malaria. Therefore, the correct answer is that Ivermectin is not indicated for Malaria.\"\n}\n```",
