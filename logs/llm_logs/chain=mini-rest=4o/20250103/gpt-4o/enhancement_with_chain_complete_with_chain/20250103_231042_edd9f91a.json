      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Tamoxifen causes ?\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Osteoporosis\nopb. Endometrial hyperplasia\nopc. Ovarian cancer\nopd. Decreased triglyceride level\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Tamoxifen\" -> \"anti-estrogenic effects\" -> \"increased risk of endometrial hyperplasia\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Tamoxifen\" -> \"estrogen receptor modulation\" -> \"possible stimulation of endometrial tissue\" -> \"increased risk of endometrial hyperplasia\" -> 80%\nCHAIN: \"Tamoxifen\" -> \"inhibition of estrogen\" -> \"reduced ovarian function\" -> \"possible risk of ovarian cancer\" -> 70%\nCHAIN: \"Tamoxifen\" -> \"effects on lipid metabolism\" -> \"possible decrease in triglyceride levels\" -> \"unclear impact\" -> 60%\nCHAIN: \"Tamoxifen\" -> \"long-term use\" -> \"possible bone density reduction\" -> \"increased risk of osteoporosis\" -> 75%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Tamoxifen)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Estrogens)\n(Bone Density)-PREDISPOSES->(Osteoporosis)\n(Endometrial Tissue)-LOCATION_OF->(Endometrial Hyperplasia)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Tamoxifen is a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) that exhibits both estrogenic and anti-estrogenic effects depending on the tissue. It is well-documented to increase the risk of endometrial hyperplasia due to its partial estrogen agonist effects on the endometrial tissue, as supported by the evidence path showing the interaction with estrogens and the location of endometrial hyperplasia in endometrial tissue. While tamoxifen can affect lipid metabolism, the impact on triglyceride levels is not consistently clear or significant. The suggestion that tamoxifen causes osteoporosis is not strongly supported, as it is more commonly associated with maintaining bone density due to its estrogenic effects on bone. The link between tamoxifen and ovarian cancer is not well-established, and the reasoning chain suggesting a risk is speculative. Therefore, the most consensus-aligned effect of tamoxifen is the increased risk of endometrial hyperplasia.\"\n}\n```",
