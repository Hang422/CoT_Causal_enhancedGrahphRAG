      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Biochemistry.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Inherited hyperammonemia is a result of deficiency of which enzyme of Krebs-Henseleit urea cycle?\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Malate dehydrogenase\nopb. Isocitrate dehydrogenase\nopc. N-acetyl glutamate synthetase\nopd. Succinate dehydrogenase\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Inherited hyperammonemia\" -> \"deficiency in urea cycle enzymes\" -> \"impaired ammonia detoxification\" -> \"elevated blood ammonia levels\" -> \"N-acetyl glutamate synthetase deficiency is known to cause hyperammonemia\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Urea cycle\" -> \"converts ammonia to urea\" -> \"requires specific enzymes\" -> \"N-acetyl glutamate synthetase is essential for activating carbamoyl phosphate\" -> \"deficiency leads to hyperammonemia\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Hyperammonemia\" -> \"can result from urea cycle enzyme deficiencies\" -> \"N-acetyl glutamate synthetase is a key enzyme\" -> \"its deficiency leads to ammonia accumulation\" -> 80%\nCHAIN: \"Krebs-Henseleit cycle\" -> \"involves urea production\" -> \"N-acetyl glutamate synthetase is crucial for cycle initiation\" -> \"deficiency results in inherited hyperammonemia\" -> 75%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(ammonia)-TREATS->(Diastasis)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Enzymes)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Inherited hyperammonemia is a result of deficiencies in enzymes of the urea cycle, which is responsible for converting ammonia to urea. N-acetyl glutamate synthetase is a crucial enzyme in this cycle, as it is essential for the activation of carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I, the first step in the urea cycle. A deficiency in N-acetyl glutamate synthetase leads to impaired ammonia detoxification and elevated blood ammonia levels, resulting in hyperammonemia. The retrieved evidence path, while broad, supports the association between enzyme deficiencies and ammonia-related disorders, aligning with the consensus that N-acetyl glutamate synthetase deficiency causes inherited hyperammonemia.\"\n}\n```",
