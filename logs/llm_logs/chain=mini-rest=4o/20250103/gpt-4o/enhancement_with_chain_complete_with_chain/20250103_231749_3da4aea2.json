      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Ethambutol causes\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Retro bulbar neuritis\nopb. Deafness\nopc. Red urine\nopd. Peripheral neuritis\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Ethambutol\" -> \"inhibition of bacterial cell wall synthesis\" -> \"potential side effects\" -> \"retrobulbar neuritis\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Ethambutol\" -> \"known side effects\" -> \"visual disturbances\" -> \"retrobulbar neuritis\" -> 80%\nCHAIN: \"Ethambutol\" -> \"metabolized in the body\" -> \"possible toxic effects\" -> \"peripheral neuritis\" -> 75%\nCHAIN: \"Ethambutol\" -> \"not commonly associated with hearing loss\" -> \"deafness unlikely\" -> 60%\nCHAIN: \"Ethambutol\" -> \"urine color changes\" -> \"red urine\" -> \"possible but not common\" -> 70%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Ethambutol)-TREATS->(Disease)-CAUSES->(Deafness)\n(Ethambutol)-TREATS->(Infection)-CAUSES->(Deafness)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Ethambutol is primarily associated with causing retrobulbar neuritis, a type of visual disturbance, as a side effect. This aligns with the consensus that ethambutol can lead to optic neuropathy, particularly affecting the optic nerve behind the eye, leading to visual impairment. The reasoning chains correctly identify retrobulbar neuritis as a known side effect, supported by the consensus that visual disturbances are a common adverse effect of ethambutol. The retrieved evidence paths suggesting a link between ethambutol and deafness are not directly relevant, as ethambutol is not commonly associated with hearing loss. Peripheral neuritis and red urine are not typical side effects of ethambutol, and the reasoning chains suggesting these are less supported by standard medical consensus. Therefore, the most accurate and consensus-aligned answer is that ethambutol causes retrobulbar neuritis.\"\n}\n```",
