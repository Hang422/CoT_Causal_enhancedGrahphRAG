      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        In herpes simplex encephalitis, drugs used are, EXCEPT:\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Acyclovir\nopb. Vidarabine\nopc. Ganciclovir\nopd. Amantadine\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Herpes simplex encephalitis\" -> \"commonly treated with antiviral medications\" -> \"Acyclovir is a first-line treatment\" -> \"Vidarabine is also used but less commonly\" -> \"Ganciclovir is primarily for cytomegalovirus\" -> \"Amantadine is not indicated for herpes simplex\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Herpes simplex virus\" -> \"causes encephalitis\" -> \"Acyclovir is effective against it\" -> \"Vidarabine is an alternative option\" -> \"Ganciclovir is not typically used for herpes simplex\" -> \"Amantadine is an antiviral for influenza\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Herpes simplex encephalitis\" -> \"requires antiviral therapy\" -> \"Acyclovir is standard treatment\" -> \"Vidarabine is an option but less preferred\" -> \"Ganciclovir is not effective for herpes simplex\" -> \"Amantadine is unrelated to herpes treatment\" -> 80%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Ganciclovir)-ISA->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(MSMB gene|MSMB)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Amantadine)\n(Ganciclovir)-TREATS->(Abnormal renal function)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(MSMB gene|MSMB)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Amantadine)\n(Acyclovir)-INTERACTS_WITH/ISA->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Vidarabine)\n(Vidarabine)-TREATS->(Herpes Simplex Infections)\n(Vidarabine)-TREATS->(Disease)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cytomegalovirus)\n(Vidarabine)-TREATS->(Infection)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cytomegalovirus)\n(Encephalitis)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Simplexvirus)-LOCATION_OF->(Acyclovir)\n(Encephalitis)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Herpesvirus 1, Human)-LOCATION_OF->(Acyclovir)\n(Herpes Simplex Infections)-PREDISPOSES->(Premature Birth)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(MSMB gene|MSMB)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Amantadine)\n(First line treatment)-TREATS->(Herpesvirus 2, Human)-LOCATION_OF->(Vidarabine)\n(First line treatment)-TREATS->(Simplexvirus)-LOCATION_OF->(Vidarabine)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"In the treatment of herpes simplex encephalitis, the standard consensus is that Acyclovir is the first-line antiviral medication due to its effectiveness against the herpes simplex virus. Vidarabine is an alternative but less commonly used option. Ganciclovir is primarily used for cytomegalovirus infections and is not typically indicated for herpes simplex encephalitis. Amantadine is an antiviral used for influenza and is not relevant to the treatment of herpes simplex encephalitis. The evidence paths confirm that Acyclovir and Vidarabine are associated with treating herpes simplex infections, while Ganciclovir and Amantadine are not directly relevant to this condition. Therefore, the drug not used for herpes simplex encephalitis is Amantadine.\"\n}\n```",
