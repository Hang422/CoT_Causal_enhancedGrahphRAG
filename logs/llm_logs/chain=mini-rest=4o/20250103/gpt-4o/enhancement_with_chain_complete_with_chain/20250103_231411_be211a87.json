      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Treatment for scabies is\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Erythromycin\nopb. Benzene hexachloride\nopc. Piperazine\nopd. Thiabendazole\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Scabies\" -> \"caused by Sarcoptes scabiei\" -> \"requires topical treatment\" -> \"Benzene hexachloride is a topical insecticide\" -> \"effective against scabies\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Scabies\" -> \"caused by a mite infestation\" -> \"treatment needed to eliminate mites\" -> \"Erythromycin is an antibiotic\" -> \"not effective against mites\" -> 80%\nCHAIN: \"Scabies\" -> \"requires antiparasitic treatment\" -> \"Piperazine is an anthelmintic\" -> \"not indicated for scabies\" -> 75%\nCHAIN: \"Scabies\" -> \"requires topical treatment\" -> \"Thiabendazole is an antifungal\" -> \"not primarily used for scabies\" -> 70%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Lindane)-TREATS->(Scabies)\n(Thiabendazole)-TREATS->(Scabies)\n(piperazine)-TREATS->(Disease)-CAUSES->(Scabies)\n(piperazine)-TREATS->(Infection)-CAUSES->(Scabies)\n(Anthelmintics)-CAUSES->(Infection)-CAUSES->(Scabies)\n(Anthelmintics)-CAUSES->(Vasculitis of the skin)-COMPLICATES->(Scabies)\n(Anthelmintics)-TREATS->(Disease)-CAUSES->(Scabies)\n(Antifungal Agents)-CAUSES->(Disease)-CAUSES->(Scabies)\n(Antifungal Agents)-CAUSES->(Infection)-CAUSES->(Scabies)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Scabies is caused by the mite Sarcoptes scabiei and requires treatment to eliminate the infestation. The standard treatment for scabies involves topical insecticides or antiparasitic agents. Benzene hexachloride, also known as Lindane, is a topical insecticide that is effective against scabies, aligning with the consensus and supported by the evidence path indicating Lindane treats scabies. Erythromycin is an antibiotic and is not effective against mite infestations, as antibiotics target bacterial infections, not parasitic infestations. Piperazine is an anthelmintic used for treating worm infections, not scabies, and the evidence paths incorrectly associate it with scabies treatment. Thiabendazole is primarily an antifungal agent and is not typically used for scabies treatment, despite the evidence path suggesting it treats scabies. Therefore, the most consensus-aligned treatment for scabies among the options is Benzene hexachloride (Lindane).\"\n}\n```",
