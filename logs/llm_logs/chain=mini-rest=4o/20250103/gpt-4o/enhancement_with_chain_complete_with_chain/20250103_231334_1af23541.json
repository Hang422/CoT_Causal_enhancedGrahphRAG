      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        All of the following drugs are indicated in the treatment of bipolar disorder except?\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Carbamazepine\nopb. Vigabatrin\nopc. Sodium valproate\nopd. Lamotrigine\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Carbamazepine\" -> \"approved for mood stabilization\" -> \"indicated for bipolar disorder\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Vigabatrin\" -> \"used primarily for epilepsy\" -> \"not indicated for bipolar disorder\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Sodium valproate\" -> \"effective in mood stabilization\" -> \"indicated for bipolar disorder\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Lamotrigine\" -> \"used for maintenance treatment\" -> \"indicated for bipolar disorder\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Vigabatrin\" -> \"not commonly used for mood disorders\" -> \"conflict with bipolar treatment guidelines\" -> 80%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Vigabatrin)-CAUSES->(Symptoms)-PREDISPOSES->(Mood Disorders)\n(Vigabatrin)-TREATS->(Disease)-COMPLICATES->(Mood Disorders)\n(Vigabatrin)-TREATS->(Adverse effects)-PREDISPOSES->(Mood Disorders)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Carbamazepine, sodium valproate, and lamotrigine are all indicated for the treatment of bipolar disorder, as they are effective in mood stabilization and maintenance treatment. Vigabatrin, however, is primarily used for the treatment of epilepsy and is not indicated for bipolar disorder. The retrieved evidence paths suggest that Vigabatrin can complicate mood disorders, which aligns with the consensus that it is not used for bipolar disorder treatment. Therefore, Vigabatrin is the exception among the listed drugs.\"\n}\n```",
