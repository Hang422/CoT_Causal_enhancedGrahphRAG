      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Which of the following is not an action of epinephrine when administered intravenously in a high dose?\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Increases liver glycogenolysis\nopb. Causes broachiolar constriction\nopc. Evokes extrasystoles in the heart\nopd. Produces restlessness and anxiety\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Epinephrine administered intravenously\" -> \"stimulates beta-adrenergic receptors\" -> \"increases heart rate and contractility\" -> \"evokes extrasystoles in the heart\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Epinephrine administered intravenously\" -> \"stimulates alpha-adrenergic receptors\" -> \"increases liver glycogenolysis\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Epinephrine administered intravenously\" -> \"stimulates beta-2 adrenergic receptors\" -> \"causes bronchodilation\" -> \"possible confusion with bronchiolar constriction\" -> 70%\nCHAIN: \"Epinephrine administered intravenously\" -> \"activates the central nervous system\" -> \"produces restlessness and anxiety\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Epinephrine administered intravenously\" -> \"causes vasoconstriction\" -> \"increases blood pressure\" -> \"not related to bronchiolar constriction\" -> 85%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Epinephrine)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cells)-INTERACTS_WITH->(beta-adrenergic receptor)\n(Epinephrine)-CAUSES->(Tachycardia)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(beta-adrenergic receptor)\n(Epinephrine)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cells)-INTERACTS_WITH->(alpha-adrenergic receptor)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Epinephrine, when administered intravenously in high doses, primarily acts on adrenergic receptors. It stimulates beta-adrenergic receptors, leading to increased heart rate and contractility, which can evoke extrasystoles in the heart. This aligns with the evidence path showing epinephrine's interaction with beta-adrenergic receptors. It also stimulates alpha-adrenergic receptors, increasing liver glycogenolysis, which is consistent with standard pharmacological knowledge. Epinephrine typically causes bronchodilation by stimulating beta-2 adrenergic receptors, contradicting the notion of bronchiolar constriction. This is supported by the evidence path indicating interaction with beta-adrenergic receptors. Additionally, epinephrine can activate the central nervous system, producing restlessness and anxiety. The evidence paths confirm epinephrine's interaction with adrenergic receptors, supporting its known actions. Therefore, the action not associated with high-dose intravenous epinephrine is bronchiolar constriction.\"\n}\n```",
