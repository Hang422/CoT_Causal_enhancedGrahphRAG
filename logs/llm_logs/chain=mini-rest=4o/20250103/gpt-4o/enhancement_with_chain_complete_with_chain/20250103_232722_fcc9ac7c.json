      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Biochemistry.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Which of the following is the source of energy for a cardiac muscle at normal conditions?\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Fatty acids\nopb. Ketone bodies\nopc. Glucose\nopd. Any of the above\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Cardiac muscle primarily uses fatty acids\" -> \"Fatty acids are abundant in the bloodstream\" -> \"Fatty acids undergo beta-oxidation\" -> \"Beta-oxidation produces ATP\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Cardiac muscle can utilize ketone bodies\" -> \"Ketone bodies are produced during fasting or low carbohydrate intake\" -> \"Ketone bodies can be converted to acetyl-CoA\" -> \"Acetyl-CoA enters the Krebs cycle\" -> \"Krebs cycle produces ATP\" -> 75%\nCHAIN: \"Cardiac muscle can also use glucose\" -> \"Glucose is metabolized through glycolysis\" -> \"Glycolysis produces pyruvate\" -> \"Pyruvate enters the mitochondria\" -> \"Pyruvate is converted to acetyl-CoA\" -> \"Acetyl-CoA enters the Krebs cycle\" -> \"Krebs cycle produces ATP\" -> 80%\nCHAIN: \"Cardiac muscle can utilize any of the above sources\" -> \"Fatty acids, ketone bodies, and glucose are all metabolized\" -> \"All three pathways produce ATP\" -> \"Cardiac muscle is adaptable to different energy sources\" -> 90%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Myocardium)-LOCATION_OF->(Glucose)\n(Myocardium)-LOCATION_OF->(Fatty Acids)\n(Fatty Acids)-PART_OF->(Cells)-LOCATION_OF->(Adenosine Triphosphate)\n(Fatty Acids)-PART_OF->(Liver)-LOCATION_OF->(Adenosine Triphosphate)\n(Glucose)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cells)-LOCATION_OF->(Adenosine Triphosphate)\n(Glucose)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Lipopolysaccharides)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Adenosine Triphosphate)\n(Adenosine Triphosphate)-TREATS->(Protein-Energy Malnutrition)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Energy Metabolism)-PROCESS_OF->(Myocardium)\n(Adenosine Triphosphate)-TREATS->(Heart failure)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Energy Metabolism)-PROCESS_OF->(Myocardium)\n(Adenosine Triphosphate)-TREATS->(Insulin Resistance)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Energy Metabolism)-PROCESS_OF->(Myocardium)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Under normal conditions, the primary source of energy for cardiac muscle is fatty acids. This is supported by the fact that fatty acids are abundant in the bloodstream and undergo beta-oxidation to produce ATP, which aligns with standard biochemical consensus. While cardiac muscle can also utilize glucose and ketone bodies, these are secondary sources under normal conditions. Glucose is metabolized through glycolysis and the Krebs cycle to produce ATP, and ketone bodies can be used during fasting or low carbohydrate intake. The retrieved evidence paths confirm that both fatty acids and glucose are located in the myocardium and are involved in ATP production, supporting their roles in energy metabolism. However, the primary reliance on fatty acids is consistent with the heart's preference for this energy source under normal physiological conditions.\"\n}\n```",
