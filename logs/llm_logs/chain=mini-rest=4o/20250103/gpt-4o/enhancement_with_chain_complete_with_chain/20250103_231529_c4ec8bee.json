      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Biochemistry.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Menke's Kinky hair syndrome is due to defect in\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Ca transporter\nopb. Cu transporter\nopc. Zn transporter\nopd. Se transporter\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Menke's Kinky hair syndrome\" -> \"characterized by defective copper metabolism\" -> \"caused by mutations in the ATP7A gene\" -> \"impairs copper transporter function\" -> \"leads to copper deficiency\" -> \"affects hair structure and pigmentation\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Menke's Kinky hair syndrome\" -> \"associated with neurological symptoms\" -> \"due to impaired copper transport\" -> \"copper is essential for enzyme function\" -> \"defect in Cu transporter\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Menke's Kinky hair syndrome\" -> \"results in kinky hair and other symptoms\" -> \"linked to copper deficiency\" -> \"copper transport is critical for hair health\" -> \"defect in Cu transporter\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Menke's Kinky hair syndrome\" -> \"involves multiple systemic effects\" -> \"copper is vital for connective tissue\" -> \"defect in Cu transporter\" -> \"possible impact on other metal transporters\" -> \"unclear if other transporters are involved\" -> 70%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Menkes Kinky Hair Syndrome)-CAUSES->(Symptoms)-CAUSES->(Neurologic Symptoms)\n(Hypocupremia)-CAUSES->(Cardiac Hypertrophy)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(neuropeptide Y|NPY)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cells)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Copper Transport Proteins)\n(Hypocupremia)-CAUSES->(Fetal Growth Retardation)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(neuropeptide Y|NPY)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cells)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Copper Transport Proteins)\n(Menkes Kinky Hair Syndrome)-CAUSES->(Hypocupremia)-CAUSES->(Neurologic Symptoms)\n(Menkes Kinky Hair Syndrome)-CAUSES->(Degenerative abnormality)-PREDISPOSES->(Neurologic Symptoms)\n(Copper)-TREATS->(Diastasis)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Membrane Transport Proteins)\n(Copper)-PREDISPOSES->(Pathogenesis)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Membrane Transport Proteins)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Menke's Kinky hair syndrome is primarily due to a defect in copper transport, specifically caused by mutations in the ATP7A gene, which impairs the function of copper transporters. This leads to copper deficiency, affecting hair structure and pigmentation, and is associated with neurological symptoms due to copper's essential role in enzyme function. The retrieved evidence supports the link between Menke's syndrome and hypocupremia, which causes neurological symptoms, further confirming the defect in copper transport. Other metal transporters are not primarily involved in this syndrome, aligning with the consensus that the defect is specific to copper transporters.\"\n}\n```",
