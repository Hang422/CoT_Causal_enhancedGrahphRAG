      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Physiology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        CAMP acts through:\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Activation of protein kinase\nopb. Activation of adenylate cyclase\nopc. Ca2+ release.\nopd. All\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"CAMP is a second messenger\" -> \"activates protein kinase\" -> \"phosphorylation of target proteins\" -> \"cellular response\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"CAMP is produced by adenylate cyclase\" -> \"increases intracellular CAMP levels\" -> \"activates protein kinase\" -> \"cellular signaling pathways\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"CAMP can influence calcium channels\" -> \"increased Ca2+ influx\" -> \"potential Ca2+ release from stores\" -> \"modulation of cellular functions\" -> 80%\nCHAIN: \"CAMP activates adenylate cyclase\" -> \"increases CAMP production\" -> \"activates protein kinase\" -> \"regulates various cellular processes\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"CAMP is involved in multiple signaling pathways\" -> \"can lead to protein kinase activation\" -> \"may also influence Ca2+ release\" -> \"supports diverse cellular functions\" -> 75%\nCHAIN: \"CAMP acts through multiple mechanisms\" -> \"activation of protein kinase\" -> \"activation of adenylate cyclase\" -> \"possible Ca2+ release\" -> \"supports the idea of 'All'\" -> 70%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(cyclic AMP)-PREVENTS->(Inflammation)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(PROTEIN KINASE)\n(Adenylate Cyclase)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Fibroblasts)-LOCATION_OF->(cyclic AMP)\n(cyclic AMP)-TREATS->(Symptoms)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(uptake)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(calcium ion)\n(cyclic AMP)-TREATS->(Symptoms)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(voltage gated channel)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(calcium ion)\n(Calcium Channel)-CAUSES->(biological adaptation to stress)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(calcium ion)\n(Calcium Channel)-CAUSES->(uptake)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(calcium ion)\n(PROTEIN KINASE)-INTERACTS_WITH/PART_OF->(Cells)-INTERACTS_WITH/LOCATION_OF->(Adenylate Cyclase)\n(cyclic AMP)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Progestins)-PART_OF->(Protoplasm)\n(calcium ion)-TREATS->(Pathogenesis)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(infliximab)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Cyclic AMP (cAMP) is a well-established second messenger that primarily acts through the activation of protein kinase A (PKA). This activation leads to the phosphorylation of various target proteins, resulting in diverse cellular responses. The production of cAMP is catalyzed by adenylate cyclase, which converts ATP to cAMP, thus increasing intracellular cAMP levels. While cAMP can influence calcium channels and potentially modulate calcium influx, its primary and most direct action is through the activation of protein kinase A. The retrieved evidence supports the role of cAMP in activating protein kinase and its production by adenylate cyclase, aligning with the consensus that cAMP acts through the activation of protein kinase. Therefore, the most accurate option is that cAMP acts through the activation of protein kinase.\"\n}\n```",
