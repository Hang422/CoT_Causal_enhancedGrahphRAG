      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Drug of choice for relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis is:\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Alpha IEN\nopb. Beta IFN\nopc. Gamma IFN\nopd. Natalizumab\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis\" -> \"requires disease-modifying therapy\" -> \"Beta IFN is a first-line treatment\" -> \"widely accepted in clinical guidelines\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis\" -> \"treatment options include various immunomodulators\" -> \"Natalizumab is effective for severe cases\" -> \"not first-line for all patients\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis\" -> \"Beta IFN reduces relapse rates\" -> \"improves long-term outcomes\" -> \"considered standard of care\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis\" -> \"Gamma IFN is not commonly used\" -> \"less evidence for efficacy\" -> \"not preferred\" -> 80%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Multiple Sclerosis)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Proteins)-INTERACTS_WITH/PART_OF->(Cells)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Recombinant Interleukin-6)-6)\n(Relapse)-CAUSES->(Adhesions)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Genes)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cells)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Recombinant Interleukin-6)\n(Relapse)-CAUSES->(Adhesions)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Genes)-PART_OF->(Bone Marrow Stem Cell)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Recombinant Interleukin-6)\n(Relapse)-CAUSES->(Disease)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Immunity)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Immunologic Adjuvants)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) requires disease-modifying therapies to manage the condition. Beta interferon (Beta IFN) is widely accepted as a first-line treatment for RRMS, as it reduces relapse rates and improves long-term outcomes, aligning with standard clinical guidelines. Natalizumab is effective for more severe cases of RRMS but is not typically used as a first-line treatment for all patients. Gamma interferon (Gamma IFN) is not commonly used for RRMS due to less evidence supporting its efficacy. The retrieved evidence paths, while broad, do not directly impact the consensus that Beta IFN is the standard of care for RRMS. Therefore, Beta IFN remains the drug of choice for relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis.\"\n}\n```",
