      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Gastric irritation is least with following NSA1D: (PGI June 2008)\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Diclofenac\nopb. Acetaminophen\nopc. Ibuprofen\nopd. Naproxen\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: Acetaminophen -> \"not classified as an NSAID\" -> \"less gastric irritation\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: Diclofenac -> \"known to cause gastric irritation\" -> \"higher risk of gastrointestinal side effects\" -> 70%\nCHAIN: Ibuprofen -> \"can cause gastric irritation\" -> \"moderate risk of gastrointestinal side effects\" -> 75%\nCHAIN: Naproxen -> \"associated with gastric irritation\" -> \"higher risk of gastrointestinal side effects\" -> 70%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Diclofenac)-TREATS->(Disease)-CAUSES->(Nonulcer dyspepsia)\n(Diclofenac)-PREVENTS->(Symptoms)-CAUSES->(Nonulcer dyspepsia)\n(Diclofenac)-PREVENTS->(Pain)-CAUSES->(Nonulcer dyspepsia)\n(Ibuprofen)-TREATS->(Disease)-CAUSES->(Nonulcer dyspepsia)\n(Ibuprofen)-PREVENTS->(Symptoms)-CAUSES->(Nonulcer dyspepsia)\n(Ibuprofen)-PREVENTS->(Pain)-CAUSES->(Nonulcer dyspepsia)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Acetaminophen is not classified as a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) and is known to have minimal effects on gastric mucosa, making it the least likely to cause gastric irritation among the options. Diclofenac, Ibuprofen, and Naproxen are all NSAIDs and are associated with varying degrees of gastric irritation due to their mechanism of inhibiting cyclooxygenase enzymes, which can lead to reduced protective gastric prostaglandins. Diclofenac and Naproxen are particularly noted for higher risks of gastrointestinal side effects. The retrieved evidence paths confirm that both Diclofenac and Ibuprofen can be associated with nonulcer dyspepsia, supporting their potential for causing gastric irritation. Therefore, based on standard medical consensus, Acetaminophen is the option least likely to cause gastric irritation.\"\n}\n```",
