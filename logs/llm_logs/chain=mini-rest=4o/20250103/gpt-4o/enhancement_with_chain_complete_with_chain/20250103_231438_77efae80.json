      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Biochemistry.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        A 10 year old child with aggressive, self mutilating behavior and poor concentration is brought with presenting complaints of joint pain and reduced urinary output. Child's presentation is most likely due to the deficiency of which enzyme?\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. HGPase\nopb. Adenosine Deaminase\nopc. APase\nopd. Acid Maltase\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Aggressive, self-mutilating behavior\" -> \"possible metabolic disorder\" -> \"joint pain and reduced urinary output\" -> \"possible enzyme deficiency\" -> \"Adenosine Deaminase deficiency\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Poor concentration\" -> \"possible neurological involvement\" -> \"joint pain\" -> \"possible systemic issue\" -> \"Adenosine Deaminase deficiency\" -> 80%\nCHAIN: \"Self-mutilating behavior\" -> \"possible genetic disorder\" -> \"joint pain\" -> \"reduced urinary output\" -> \"Adenosine Deaminase deficiency\" -> 75%\nCHAIN: \"Joint pain and reduced urinary output\" -> \"possible accumulation of toxic metabolites\" -> \"Adenosine Deaminase deficiency\" -> \"impaired immune function\" -> 70%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Aggressive behavior)-CAUSES->(Disease)-CAUSES->(Metabolic Diseases)\n(Aggressive behavior)-CAUSES->(Diabetes Mellitus, Insulin-Dependent)-CAUSES->(Metabolic Diseases)\n(Aggressive behavior)-CAUSES->(Infection)-CAUSES->(Metabolic Diseases)\n(Metabolic Diseases)-CAUSES->(Disease)-CAUSES->(Arthralgia)\n(Metabolic Diseases)-CAUSES->(Obesity)-CAUSES->(Arthralgia)\n(Metabolic Diseases)-CAUSES->(Infection)-CAUSES->(Arthralgia)\n(Arthralgia)-CAUSES->(Disease)-CAUSES->(Enzyme Deficiency)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"The child's symptoms, including aggressive and self-mutilating behavior, joint pain, and reduced urinary output, are indicative of Lesch-Nyhan syndrome, which is caused by a deficiency of the enzyme hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT). This condition is characterized by neurological and behavioral abnormalities, as well as uric acid overproduction leading to joint pain and potential kidney issues. The reasoning chains incorrectly linked these symptoms to adenosine deaminase deficiency, which is associated with severe combined immunodeficiency and not the described symptoms. The retrieved evidence paths broadly connect aggressive behavior and metabolic diseases but do not specifically support adenosine deaminase deficiency. Therefore, the correct enzyme deficiency related to the child's presentation is HPRT, not adenosine deaminase.\"\n}\n```",
