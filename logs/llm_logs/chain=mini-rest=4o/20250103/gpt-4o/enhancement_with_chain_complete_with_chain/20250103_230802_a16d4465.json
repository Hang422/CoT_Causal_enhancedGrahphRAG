      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Biochemistry.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Which helps in the production of more glucose?\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Pyruvate kinase\nopb. Pyruvate carboxylase\nopc. PDH\nopd. Pyruvate decarboxylase\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Pyruvate carboxylase\" -> \"converts pyruvate to oxaloacetate\" -> \"increases gluconeogenesis\" -> \"produces more glucose\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Pyruvate kinase\" -> \"catalyzes conversion of phosphoenolpyruvate to pyruvate\" -> \"decreases glucose production\" -> \"not helpful for more glucose\" -> 70%\nCHAIN: \"PDH\" -> \"converts pyruvate to acetyl-CoA\" -> \"enters the Krebs cycle\" -> \"does not directly increase glucose\" -> 60%\nCHAIN: \"Pyruvate decarboxylase\" -> \"converts pyruvate to acetaldehyde\" -> \"not involved in glucose production\" -> \"not helpful for more glucose\" -> 50%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Pyruvate Dehydrogenase Complex Deficiency Disease)-CAUSES->(Cardiac Hypertrophy)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Genes)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Acetyl Coenzyme A)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Pyruvate carboxylase is the enzyme that helps in the production of more glucose. It catalyzes the conversion of pyruvate to oxaloacetate, a key step in gluconeogenesis, which is the metabolic pathway that results in the generation of glucose from non-carbohydrate substrates. This aligns with the consensus that pyruvate carboxylase increases gluconeogenesis and thus glucose production. Pyruvate kinase, on the other hand, catalyzes the conversion of phosphoenolpyruvate to pyruvate, which is a step in glycolysis, not gluconeogenesis, and therefore does not help in producing more glucose. PDH (Pyruvate Dehydrogenase) converts pyruvate to acetyl-CoA, which enters the Krebs cycle, a process not directly involved in glucose production. Pyruvate decarboxylase converts pyruvate to acetaldehyde, a step in fermentation, not related to glucose production. The retrieved evidence path involving acetyl-CoA is relevant to PDH but does not support glucose production, confirming that PDH is not directly involved in increasing glucose levels.\"\n}\n```",
