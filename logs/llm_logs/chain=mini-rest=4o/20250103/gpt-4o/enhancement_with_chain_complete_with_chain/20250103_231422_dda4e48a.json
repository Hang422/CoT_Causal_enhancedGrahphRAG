      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Biochemistry.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        True statement regarding insulin:\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Produced by alpha cells of pancreas\nopb. Two polypeptide chains are bound by disulfide linkages\nopc. Shifts potassium outside the cell\nopd. S.c insulin tl/2 is 60 mins\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Insulin is a hormone\" -> \"produced by beta cells of the pancreas\" -> \"not produced by alpha cells\" -> \"option a is incorrect\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: s\" -> \"connected by disulfide linkages\" -> \"this is a true statement\" -> \"option b is correct\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Insulin facilitates cellular uptake of glucose\" -> \"also affects potassium levels\" -> \"shifts potassium into the cell\" -> \"option c is incorrect\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Subcutaneous insulin has a half-life\" -> \"approximately 60 minutes\" -> \"this is a true statement\" -> \"option d is correct\" -> 85%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Insulin)-CAUSES->(Energy Metabolism)-PROCESS_OF->(Pancreas)\n(Insulin)-CAUSES->(physiological aspects)-PROCESS_OF->(Pancreas)\n(Insulin)-CAUSES->(Excretory function)-PROCESS_OF->(Pancreas)\n(Serum potassium assay)-DIAGNOSES->(Accelerated atrioventricular conduction)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cells)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Option a is incorrect because insulin is produced by beta cells, not alpha cells, which produce glucagon. Option b is correct; insulin consists of two polypeptide chains (A and B) linked by disulfide bonds. Option c is incorrect; insulin facilitates the uptake of potassium into cells, not out of them. Option d is incorrect; the half-life of subcutaneous insulin is typically shorter, around 4-6 minutes for circulating insulin, but the duration of action can be longer depending on the formulation. The retrieved evidence paths broadly support the role of insulin in metabolism and physiological processes but do not directly address the specifics of these options.\"\n}\n```",
