      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Physiology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Which of the following is not carried in dorsal column of spinal cord:March 2011\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Proprioception\nopb. Vibratory sense\nopc. Heat sensation\nopd. Touch\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Dorsal column function\" -> \"Carries proprioception\" -> \"Carries vibratory sense\" -> \"Does not carry heat sensation\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Dorsal column pathway\" -> \"Transmits touch sensation\" -> \"Transmits proprioception\" -> \"Does not transmit heat sensation\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Dorsal column\" -> \"Involved in fine touch\" -> \"Involved in proprioception\" -> \"Not involved in heat sensation\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Dorsal column\" -> \"Carries sensory modalities\" -> \"Includes touch and proprioception\" -> \"Excludes heat sensation\" -> 80%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Dorsal funiculus)-LOCATION_OF->(SLIT2 gene|SLIT3|SLIT2)-PART_OF->(Endothelium)-LOCATION_OF->(Therapeutic tactile stimulation)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"The dorsal column of the spinal cord is primarily responsible for carrying sensory modalities such as proprioception, vibratory sense, and fine touch. It does not carry heat sensation, which is transmitted via the spinothalamic tract. All reasoning chains correctly identify that the dorsal column does not carry heat sensation, aligning with standard medical consensus. The retrieved evidence paths do not directly address the sensory modalities of the dorsal column and are therefore not relevant to the question. Thus, the correct answer is that heat sensation is not carried in the dorsal column.\"\n}\n```",
