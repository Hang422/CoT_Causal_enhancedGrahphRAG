Anti depressants\nopb. Anti psychotics\nopc. Anti epileptics\nopd. Mood stabilizers\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nSchizophrenia is primarily treated with antipsychotics, which target dopamine dysregulation and are effective in reducing positive symptoms such as hallucinations and delusions. While antipsychotics may also have some effect on negative and cognitive symptoms, their primary role is in managing positive symptoms. Antidepressants are not the primary treatment for schizophrenia but may be used as adjunctive therapy for co-occurring depressive symptoms. Antiepileptics and mood stabilizers are not standard treatments for schizophrenia; however, they may be considered in specific cases for mood stabilization or when there are comorbid conditions. Overall, antipsychotics are the cornerstone of schizophrenia treatment, supported by evidence of their efficacy in managing the disorder's core symptoms.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Schizophrenia is primarily treated with antipsychotic medications, which are specifically designed to address the symptoms of this disorder, particularly the positive symptoms such as hallucinations and delusions. The enhanced information confirms that antipsychotics are the cornerstone of treatment for schizophrenia, while antidepressants, antiepileptics, and mood stabilizers are not standard treatments. Antidepressants may be used in conjunction with antipsychotics if depressive symptoms are present, but they do not address the core symptoms of schizophrenia. Therefore, the most appropriate and supported option for the treatment of schizophrenia is antipsychotics.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
