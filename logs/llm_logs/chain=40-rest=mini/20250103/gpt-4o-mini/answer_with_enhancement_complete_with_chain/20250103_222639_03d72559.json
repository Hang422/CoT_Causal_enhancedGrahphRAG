Cholestyramine\nopb. Thiazide diuretics\nopc. Quinidine\nopd. Amlodipine\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nCholestyramine binds to digoxin in the gastrointestinal tract, leading to decreased absorption and a significant drug interaction. Thiazide diuretics can cause hypokalemia, which increases the risk of digoxin toxicity, thus representing a significant interaction. Quinidine inhibits P-glycoprotein, resulting in increased digoxin levels and a significant interaction. In contrast, amlodipine, a calcium channel blocker, does not significantly affect digoxin levels or its pharmacokinetics, indicating no significant drug interaction. Therefore, the drug with no significant interaction with digoxin is amlodipine.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Digoxin is a cardiac glycoside that has several known drug interactions. Cholestyramine binds to digoxin in the gastrointestinal tract, leading to decreased absorption, which is a significant interaction. Thiazide diuretics can cause hypokalemia, increasing the risk of digoxin toxicity, thus representing another significant interaction. Quinidine inhibits P-glycoprotein, which can lead to increased levels of digoxin, also indicating a significant interaction. In contrast, amlodipine, a calcium channel blocker, does not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of digoxin and is not known to cause any clinically significant interactions. Therefore, the drug with no significant interaction with digoxin is amlodipine.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}",
