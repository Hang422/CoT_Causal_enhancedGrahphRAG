This hormone is:\n\n                    ### Options\n                    opa. Endothelial growth factor (EGF)\nopb. Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG)\nopc. Human chorionic somatotropin (HCS)\nopd. Relaxin\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nThe placenta secretes Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG), which is the hormone utilized in the early detection of pregnancy. hCG is produced shortly after the embryo implants in the uterine lining and can be detected in both urine and blood, making it a reliable marker for pregnancy tests. The reasoning chains correctly highlight that hCG is associated with early pregnancy detection, with a high percentage of accuracy in these tests. The retrieved evidence paths support the role of hCG in early diagnosis, confirming its significance in pregnancy detection. Other options, such as Endothelial Growth Factor (EGF), Human Chorionic Somatotropin (HCS), and Relaxin, do not play a role in early pregnancy detection and are therefore not relevant to the question.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "
