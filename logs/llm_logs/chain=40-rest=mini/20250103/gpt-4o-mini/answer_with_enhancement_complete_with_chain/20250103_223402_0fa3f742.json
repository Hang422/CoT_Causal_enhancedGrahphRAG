Thiamine\nopb. Pyridoxine\nopc. Niacin\nopd. Riboflavin\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nIsoniazid (INH) is known to interfere with pyridoxine (vitamin B6) metabolism, leading to pyridoxine deficiency, which can result in peripheral neuropathy. The consensus in pharmacology indicates that pyridoxine supplementation is the primary treatment for INH-induced neuropathy. The reasoning chains consistently support this, showing that pyridoxine administration can correct the deficiency and improve neuropathy symptoms. Evidence paths confirm the association between INH and pyridoxine deficiency, reinforcing the need for pyridoxine in treatment. Therefore, the best option for treating INH-induced neuropathy is pyridoxine.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Isoniazid (INH) is known to cause peripheral neuropathy due to its interference with pyridoxine (vitamin B6) metabolism, leading to a deficiency. The standard treatment for INH-induced neuropathy is pyridoxine supplementation, as it directly addresses the deficiency caused by INH. Other options like thiamine, niacin, and riboflavin do not have a direct role in treating this specific neuropathy. Therefore, based on established pharmacological principles and consensus, pyridoxine is the most appropriate treatment for INH-induced neuropathy.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
