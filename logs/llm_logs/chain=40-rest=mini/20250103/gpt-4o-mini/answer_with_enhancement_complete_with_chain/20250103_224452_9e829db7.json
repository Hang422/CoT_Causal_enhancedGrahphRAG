Streptomycin\nopb. Ethambutol\nopc. Capreomycin\nopd. Rifampicin\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nIn evaluating the antitubercular drugs for safety in severe renal failure, the following conclusions can be drawn: \n\n1. **Streptomycin**: This aminoglycoside antibiotic is primarily excreted by the kidneys. In severe renal failure, it can accumulate, leading to increased risk of toxicity. Therefore, it is not safe to use without careful monitoring and dose adjustment. \n\n2. **Ethambutol**: Ethambutol is also excreted by the kidneys and can accumulate in renal failure. Dose adjustment is necessary to avoid toxicity, making it not safe to use without such adjustments. \n\n3. **Capreomycin**: Similar to streptomycin, capreomycin is an aminoglycoside-like antibiotic that is excreted by the kidneys. It can accumulate in cases of renal failure, thus it is not safe in severe renal failure. \n\n4. **Rifampicin**: Rifampicin is primarily metabolized by the liver, with minimal renal excretion. This makes it safe to use in patients with severe renal failure, as it does not accumulate in the same way as the other options. \n\nIn summary, rifampicin is the only antitubercular drug among the options that can be safely used in severe renal failure, while streptomycin, ethambutol, and capreomycin pose risks due to potential accumulation.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"In evaluating the safety of antitubercular drugs in patients with severe renal failure, it is crucial to consider the pharmacokinetics of each drug. Streptomycin, ethambutol, and capreomycin are all primarily excreted by the kidneys, which means they can accumulate in cases of renal impairment, leading to increased risk of toxicity. Therefore, their use in severe renal failure is not recommended without careful monitoring and dose adjustments. On the other hand, rifampicin is mainly metabolized by the liver, with minimal renal excretion, making it safer for use in patients with severe renal failure. This aligns with the consensus in pharmacology regarding the management of tuberculosis in patients with renal impairment. Thus, rifampicin is the most appropriate choice among the options provided.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
