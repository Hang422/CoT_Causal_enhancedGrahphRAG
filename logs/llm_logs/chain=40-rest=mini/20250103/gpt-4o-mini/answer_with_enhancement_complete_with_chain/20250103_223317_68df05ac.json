Outer hair cells in basal area\nopb. Inner hair cells in basal area\nopc. Outer hair cells in apical area\nopd. Inner hair cells in apical area\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nAminoglycosides are known to cause ototoxicity, primarily affecting cochlear hair cells. The damage is most pronounced in the outer hair cells located in the basal area of the cochlea, which is consistent with the consensus that these cells are more susceptible to aminoglycoside-induced toxicity. Inner hair cells are also affected but to a lesser extent. The evidence paths confirm the relationship between aminoglycosides and ototoxicity but do not specifically clarify the differential impact on hair cell types or locations. Therefore, the most accurate option is that aminoglycosides primarily affect outer hair cells in the basal area.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Aminoglycosides are a class of antibiotics known for their ototoxic effects, particularly on cochlear hair cells. The consensus in the medical literature indicates that outer hair cells, especially those located in the basal area of the cochlea, are the most susceptible to damage from aminoglycosides. While inner hair cells can also be affected, the degree of damage is significantly less compared to outer hair cells. Therefore, the most accurate answer, based on the established understanding of aminoglycoside ototoxicity, is that they primarily affect outer hair cells in the basal area.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}",
