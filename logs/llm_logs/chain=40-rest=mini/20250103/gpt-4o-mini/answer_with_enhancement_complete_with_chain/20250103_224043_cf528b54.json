This results in polyuria and the production of dilute urine with low osmolality. The typical urine osmolality in DI is generally less than 300 mmol/L, often falling below 150 mmol/L in severe cases. Therefore, the most accurate option reflecting the consensus is <300 mmol/L, as urine osmolality can vary but is consistently low due to the impaired water reabsorption. The evidence path indicating that DI causes polyuria supports this understanding.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "
