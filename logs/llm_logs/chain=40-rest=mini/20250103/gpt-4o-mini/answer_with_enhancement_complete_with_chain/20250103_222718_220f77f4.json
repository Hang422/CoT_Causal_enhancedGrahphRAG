Tolazoline\nopb. Clonidine\nopc. Bismuth\nopd. Oxymetazoline\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nTolazoline is a vasodilator used in diagnostic tests for pulmonary hypertension, aligning with its mechanism of increasing blood flow. Clonidine, an alpha-2 adrenergic agonist, is used in diagnostic tests for pheochromocytoma due to its ability to decrease sympathetic outflow and reduce blood pressure. Bismuth is primarily used for gastrointestinal protection and is not typically involved in diagnostic tests, while oxymetazoline is a vasoconstrictor used for nasal congestion relief and is also not used in diagnostic tests. Therefore, the most relevant options for diagnostic tests are Tolazoline and Clonidine.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"In evaluating the options provided, we consider the primary uses of each drug in diagnostic tests. Tolazoline is a vasodilator that is indeed used in tests for pulmonary hypertension, which aligns with its pharmacological action of increasing blood flow. Clonidine, while used in diagnostic tests for pheochromocytoma, is less commonly associated with a specific test compared to Tolazoline's established role in pulmonary hypertension diagnostics. Bismuth is not relevant to diagnostic tests, and oxymetazoline is primarily a nasal decongestant with no diagnostic application. Given this context, Tolazoline stands out as the most appropriate choice for a drug used in a diagnostic test, particularly for its established role in assessing pulmonary hypertension. Therefore, the best-supported option is Tolazoline.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
