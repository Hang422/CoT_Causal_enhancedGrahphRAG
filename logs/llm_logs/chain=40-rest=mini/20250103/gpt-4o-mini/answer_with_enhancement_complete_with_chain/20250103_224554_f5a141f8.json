Hyponatremia\nopb. Hyperkalemia\nopc. Hypoglycemia\nopd. Metabolic alkalosis\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nAdrenal insufficiency is characterized by decreased production of adrenal hormones, particularly cortisol and aldosterone. This leads to several physiological changes: 1) Decreased aldosterone results in decreased sodium reabsorption, causing hyponatremia. 2) Decreased aldosterone also leads to decreased potassium excretion, resulting in hyperkalemia. 3) Decreased cortisol impairs gluconeogenesis, which can lead to hypoglycemia. 4) Contrary to the reasoning chain, adrenal insufficiency is associated with metabolic acidosis due to decreased aldosterone, not metabolic alkalosis. Therefore, the correct answer is that adrenal insufficiency is not associated with metabolic alkalosis.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Adrenal insufficiency leads to a deficiency in cortisol and aldosterone. This results in several physiological changes: 1) Hyponatremia occurs due to decreased sodium reabsorption from the kidneys, which is a direct effect of low aldosterone levels. 2) Hyperkalemia is also a consequence of decreased aldosterone, as it normally promotes potassium excretion. 3) Hypoglycemia can occur due to low cortisol levels, which are essential for gluconeogenesis and maintaining blood glucose levels. 4) Metabolic alkalosis is not typically associated with adrenal insufficiency; rather, metabolic acidosis is more common due to the effects of low aldosterone on acid-base balance. Therefore, the correct answer is that adrenal insufficiency is not associated with metabolic alkalosis.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
