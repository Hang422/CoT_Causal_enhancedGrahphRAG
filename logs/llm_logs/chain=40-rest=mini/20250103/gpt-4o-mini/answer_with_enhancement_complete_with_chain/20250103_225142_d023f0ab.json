HDL\nopb. LDL\nopc. VLDL\nopd. Chylomicrons\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nCholesterol is synthesized in the liver and primarily transported to peripheral tissues by Low-Density Lipoproteins (LDL). The reasoning chain is as follows: Cholesterol is synthesized in the liver, packaged into Very Low-Density Lipoproteins (VLDL), which then deliver triglycerides to tissues. VLDL remnants are converted to LDL in the bloodstream, and LDL is responsible for transporting cholesterol to peripheral tissues. HDL is primarily involved in reverse cholesterol transport, not as the main transporter to peripheral tissues. Chylomicrons mainly transport dietary lipids and are not involved in cholesterol transport from the liver. Therefore, the correct answer is LDL, supported by the consensus that LDL is the primary carrier of cholesterol to peripheral tissues.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Cholesterol is synthesized in the liver and transported to peripheral tissues primarily by Low-Density Lipoproteins (LDL). While Very Low-Density Lipoproteins (VLDL) are involved in the transport of triglycerides and can be converted to LDL, it is LDL that is specifically responsible for delivering cholesterol to tissues. High-Density Lipoproteins (HDL) are involved in reverse cholesterol transport, taking cholesterol from tissues back to the liver, and Chylomicrons primarily transport dietary lipids from the intestines. Therefore, the consensus in the medical community supports that LDL is the main transporter of cholesterol from the liver to peripheral tissues. This reasoning aligns with the enhanced information provided, confirming that LDL is the correct answer.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
