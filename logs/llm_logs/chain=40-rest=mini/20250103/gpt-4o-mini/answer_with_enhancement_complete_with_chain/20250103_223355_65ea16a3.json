Vitamin A\nopb. Vitamin B\nopc. Vitamin C\nopd. Vitamin E\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nNyctalopia, or night blindness, is primarily caused by a deficiency in Vitamin A, which is essential for the synthesis of rhodopsin, a visual pigment in rod cells that is crucial for low-light vision. The reasoning chains consistently point to Vitamin A deficiency as the primary cause, with high confidence levels (90-95%). Evidence paths support this by linking malnutrition and night blindness directly to Vitamin A deficiency. Other vitamins (B, C, E) are not associated with nyctalopia, confirming that the correct answer is Vitamin A.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

This vitamin is crucial for the production of rhodopsin, a pigment found in the rod cells of the retina that is essential for vision in low-light conditions. The consensus in medical literature strongly supports that Vitamin A deficiency leads to impaired night vision, while deficiencies in Vitamins B, C, and E do not have a direct association with nyctalopia.
