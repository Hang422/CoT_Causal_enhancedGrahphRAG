Protein linked with glycosidic bond\nopb. Core protein\nopc. Sugar residues are long in carbohydrate poion of glycoprotein\nopd. None\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nGlycoproteins are proteins that have carbohydrate moieties attached to them via glycosidic bonds, confirming option 'opa' as correct. The term 'core protein' in option 'opb' is somewhat vague; while glycoproteins do have a core protein component, this description lacks specificity and clarity, making it less definitive. Option 'opc' suggests that sugar residues are long in the carbohydrate portion of glycoproteins, which is not universally true as glycoproteins can have varying lengths of carbohydrate chains. Therefore, this option is misleading. Option 'opd' is incorrect as at least one of the previous options is valid. The evidence path regarding glycoproteins interacting with cells supports the functional role of glycoproteins in biological systems but does not directly clarify the characteristics of glycoproteins. Thus, the best-supported conclusion is that glycoproteins are indeed proteins linked with glycosidic bonds.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "
