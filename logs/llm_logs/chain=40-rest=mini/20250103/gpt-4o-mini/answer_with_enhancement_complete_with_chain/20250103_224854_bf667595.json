Vasopressin\nopb. Terlipressin\nopc. Desmopressin\nopd. Pralipressin\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nNeurogenic diabetes insipidus is characterized by a deficiency of vasopressin (antidiuretic hormone) due to a central cause, leading to symptoms such as polyuria and polydipsia. The treatment of choice is Desmopressin, a synthetic analog of vasopressin, which effectively reduces these symptoms by mimicking the action of vasopressin. Other options like Vasopressin, Terlipressin, and Pralipressin are not preferred for this specific condition. Evidence supports that Desmopressin is the preferred vasopressin analog for managing central diabetes insipidus, confirming its role in treating the deficiency of antidiuretic hormone.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Neurogenic diabetes insipidus is caused by a deficiency of vasopressin (antidiuretic hormone) due to a central nervous system issue. The primary treatment for this condition is Desmopressin, which is a synthetic analog of vasopressin. It effectively mimics the action of vasopressin, leading to reduced urine output and alleviation of symptoms such as polyuria and polydipsia. While Vasopressin itself can be used, Desmopressin is preferred due to its longer duration of action and fewer side effects. Terlipressin and Pralipressin are not typically used for neurogenic diabetes insipidus. Therefore, the best-supported option based on current medical consensus is Desmopressin.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opc\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
