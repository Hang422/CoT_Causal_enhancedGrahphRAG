Produced by alpha cells of pancreas\nopb. Two polypeptide chains are bound by disulfide linkages\nopc. Shifts potassium outside the cell\nopd. S.c insulin tl/2 is 60 mins\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nInsulin is produced by beta cells of the pancreas, not alpha cells, which produce glucagon. Insulin consists of two polypeptide chains (A and B) linked by disulfide bonds, confirming the second option. Insulin facilitates the uptake of potassium into cells, not outside, contradicting the third option. The half-life of subcutaneous insulin is approximately 5-10 minutes, not 60 minutes, which invalidates the fourth option. Therefore, the only true statement regarding insulin is that it is composed of two polypeptide chains bound by disulfide linkages.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Insulin is a hormone produced by the beta cells of the pancreas, not the alpha cells, which produce glucagon. The structure of insulin consists of two polypeptide chains (A and B) that are linked by disulfide bonds, making option opb correct. Insulin does not shift potassium outside the cell; rather, it facilitates the uptake of potassium into cells, which invalidates option opc. The half-life of subcutaneous insulin is much shorter than 60 minutes, typically around 5-10 minutes, which makes option opd incorrect. Therefore, the only true statement regarding insulin is that it consists of two polypeptide chains bound by disulfide linkages, confirming option opb as the correct answer.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
