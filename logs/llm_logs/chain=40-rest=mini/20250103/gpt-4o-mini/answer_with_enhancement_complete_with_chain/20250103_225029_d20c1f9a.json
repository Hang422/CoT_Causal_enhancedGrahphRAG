This hormone is produced in which one of the following anatomical locations?\n\n                    ### Options\n                    opa. Hypothalamus\nopb. Anterior pituitary\nopc. Posterior pituitary\nopd. Adrenal cortex\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nOxytocin is a hormone that is synthesized in the hypothalamus and then transported to the posterior pituitary gland, where it is stored and released into the bloodstream. This release occurs during labor and is responsible for stimulating uterine contractions. The reasoning chains correctly identify the hypothalamus as the site of production and the posterior pituitary as the site of storage and release. The evidence paths confirm the relationship between oxytocin and the hypothalamic structure, supporting the consensus that the hypothalamus is the anatomical location where oxytocin is produced.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Oxytocin is the hormone responsible for stimulating uterine contractions during labor. It is synthesized in the hypothalamus, specifically in the supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei. After its synthesis, oxytocin is transported down the axons to the posterior pituitary gland, where it is stored and released into the bloodstream during labor. Therefore, while the posterior pituitary is the site of release, the actual production of oxytocin occurs in the hypothalamus. Given the options provided, the most accurate answer regarding the anatomical location of production is the hypothalamus.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}",
