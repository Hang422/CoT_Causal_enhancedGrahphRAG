Lipase\nopb. Pepsinogens\nopc. HCI\nopd. None\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nThe stomach secretes several substances critical for digestion. Pepsinogens are secreted by the stomach and converted to pepsin, which aids in protein digestion. Hydrochloric acid (HCl) is also secreted by the stomach, creating an acidic environment necessary for enzyme activity. Gastric lipase, while present in the stomach, is not the primary lipase involved in lipid digestion; this role is mainly fulfilled by pancreatic lipase. Therefore, while gastric lipase is secreted by the stomach, it is less significant compared to the lipase secreted by the pancreas. The option 'None' is incorrect as it implies all listed substances are secreted by the stomach, which is misleading regarding the primary source of lipase. Thus, the correct answer to the question of which is not secreted by the stomach is 'Lipase.'\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "
