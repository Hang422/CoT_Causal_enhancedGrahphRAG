Spectrin\nopb. Ankyrin\nopc. Tubulin\nopd. Laminin\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nThe plasma membrane of a cell is primarily anchored to the cytoskeleton by ankyrin, which serves to connect spectrin (a cytoskeletal protein) to membrane proteins, thereby stabilizing the membrane structure. Spectrin itself is crucial for maintaining cell shape and integrity. Tubulin, while a component of microtubules, does not directly bind to the plasma membrane, and laminin is an extracellular matrix protein that does not play a direct role in cytoskeletal binding. Therefore, the most accurate option is ankyrin, supported by its role in anchoring spectrin to the plasma membrane.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The plasma membrane of a cell is anchored to the cytoskeleton primarily through the interaction of ankyrin with spectrin. Ankyrin acts as a linker protein that connects spectrin, which forms a mesh-like structure beneath the plasma membrane, to integral membrane proteins. This connection is crucial for maintaining the structural integrity and shape of the cell. While spectrin is important for the cytoskeletal framework, it is ankyrin that directly facilitates the binding of spectrin to the membrane. Tubulin is involved in microtubule formation and does not directly anchor the plasma membrane, and laminin is part of the extracellular matrix, not the cytoskeleton. Therefore, the best-supported option is ankyrin, as it plays a direct role in linking the cytoskeleton to the plasma membrane.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
