Patient gives history of recurrent bacterial infections. Ophthalmic examination reveals white triangular plaques on conjunctiva. This patient is suffering from deficiency of:\n\n                    ### Options\n                    opa. Vitamin D\nopb. Vitamin B\nopc. Vitamin A\nopd. Vitamin C\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nThe patient's symptoms of diminished night vision, dryness of eyes, recurrent bacterial infections, and the presence of white triangular plaques on the conjunctiva are indicative of Vitamin A deficiency. Vitamin A is crucial for the production of rhodopsin, which is necessary for night vision, and its deficiency leads to night blindness. Additionally, Vitamin A is essential for maintaining the integrity of epithelial tissues, including the conjunctiva, and its deficiency can result in dry eyes and the formation of Bitot's spots. Furthermore, Vitamin A plays a significant role in immune function, and its deficiency can predispose individuals to recurrent infections. Therefore, the most accurate conclusion is that this patient is suffering from a deficiency of Vitamin A.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

Vitamin A is essential for the synthesis of rhodopsin, which is critical for night vision. Its deficiency can lead to night blindness and dryness of the conjunctiva, as well as the formation of Bitot's spots, which are the white triangular plaques observed in this patient. Additionally, Vitamin A is important for maintaining the integrity of epithelial tissues and plays a significant role in immune function, which explains the recurrent bacterial infections.
