It is more common with huminsulin\nopb. It may occur in the presence of infections\nopc. It may be due to antibodies to insulin\nopd. Use of glucocorticoids may be useful in severe cases\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nInsulin resistance is a complex condition influenced by various factors. Regarding the options: 1) Huminsulin is a common form of insulin therapy, and while it is used widely, it does not inherently lead to increased insulin resistance; thus, the statement about it being more common with huminsulin is misleading. 2) Infections can indeed trigger an inflammatory response, which is known to increase insulin resistance, making this statement true. 3) Antibodies to insulin can bind to insulin and reduce its effectiveness, leading to increased insulin resistance, which is also a true statement. 4) Glucocorticoids are known to increase blood glucose levels and can worsen insulin resistance rather than being useful in severe cases, making this statement false. Therefore, the correct answer is that the statement regarding glucocorticoids is the exception, as they do not help in managing insulin resistance effectively.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"To determine the false statement regarding insulin resistance in diabetic patients, we analyze each option: 1) 'It is more common with huminsulin' - Huminsulin is a type of insulin therapy, and while insulin resistance can occur in patients using any form of insulin, it is not specifically more common with huminsulin compared to other types. This statement is misleading. 2) 'It may occur in the presence of infections' - This is true, as infections can lead to an inflammatory response that increases insulin resistance. 3) 'It may be due to antibodies to insulin' - This is also true; antibodies can bind to insulin and reduce its effectiveness, leading to increased insulin resistance. 4) 'Use of glucocorticoids may be useful in severe cases' - This statement is false because glucocorticoids are known to exacerbate insulin resistance and increase blood glucose levels, making them counterproductive in managing insulin resistance. Therefore, the statement about glucocorticoids is the exception. The most misleading statement is the one regarding glucocorticoids, as they do not help in managing insulin resistance effectively. Thus, the correct answer is option 'opd'.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}",
