Flutamide\nopb. Finasteride\nopc. Prazosin\nopd. Minoxidil\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nFinasteride is a 5α-reductase inhibitor that effectively reduces dihydrotestosterone (DHT) levels, leading to decreased prostate size and improved symptoms of benign prostatic hypertrophy. Additionally, it reduces hair follicle miniaturization, thereby improving male pattern baldness. This dual efficacy is well-supported by clinical evidence. In contrast, Flutamide primarily acts as an androgen receptor blocker and does not have established benefits for hair loss. Prazosin, an alpha-1 adrenergic receptor blocker, may help with urinary symptoms but has no effect on hair. Minoxidil, while effective for hair growth through vasodilation, does not address prostate issues. Therefore, the correct answer is Finasteride.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The question asks for a 5α-reductase inhibitor effective in both benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH) and male pattern baldness. Finasteride is the only drug among the options that fits this description. It works by inhibiting the enzyme 5α-reductase, which decreases the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT), leading to reduced prostate size and improved urinary symptoms in BPH, as well as promoting hair regrowth in male pattern baldness. Flutamide is an androgen receptor blocker and does not have effects on hair loss. Prazosin is an alpha-1 blocker that does not affect hair or prostate size. Minoxidil is effective for hair growth but does not address prostate issues. Therefore, the best-supported option is Finasteride, which has clear clinical evidence for both indications.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
