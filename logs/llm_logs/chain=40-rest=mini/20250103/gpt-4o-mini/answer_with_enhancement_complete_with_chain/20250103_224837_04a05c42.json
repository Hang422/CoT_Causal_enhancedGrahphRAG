Penicillin G\nopb. Tetracycline\nopc. Azithromycin\nopd. Doxycycline\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nTreponema pallidum is the causative agent of syphilis. The standard consensus in medical practice is that Penicillin G is the drug of choice for treating syphilis due to its high efficacy and safety profile. Tetracycline and Doxycycline are considered alternative treatments, particularly in patients with penicillin allergies, but they are less effective than Penicillin G. Azithromycin can be used in certain cases, but concerns about resistance limit its use as a first-line treatment. Therefore, the most appropriate choice remains Penicillin G.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Treponema pallidum is the bacterium responsible for syphilis, and the standard treatment is well-established in medical literature. Penicillin G is the first-line treatment due to its proven efficacy and safety profile. While Tetracycline and Doxycycline are alternatives for patients with penicillin allergies, they are not as effective as Penicillin G. Azithromycin has been used in some cases, but its use is limited due to concerns about antibiotic resistance. Therefore, the consensus strongly supports Penicillin G as the drug of choice for treating syphilis caused by Treponema pallidum.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
