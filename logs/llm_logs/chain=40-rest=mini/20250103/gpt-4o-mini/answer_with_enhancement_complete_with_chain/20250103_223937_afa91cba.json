Collecting duct\nopb. Glomerulus\nopc. Proximal convoluted tubule\nopd. Loop of Henle\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nAldosterone primarily acts on the collecting duct of the nephron, where it promotes sodium reabsorption and potassium excretion. This action is crucial for maintaining electrolyte balance and regulating blood pressure. The reasoning chains correctly identify the collecting duct as the site of action for aldosterone, supported by its role in increasing sodium channels and enhancing sodium reabsorption. Evidence paths indicating aldosterone's influence on nephron function further reinforce this consensus. Other options, such as the glomerulus, proximal convoluted tubule, and loop of Henle, do not align with the established understanding of aldosterone's specific actions.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Aldosterone is a steroid hormone produced by the adrenal cortex that plays a critical role in regulating sodium and potassium levels in the body. Its primary site of action is the collecting duct of the nephron, where it promotes sodium reabsorption and potassium excretion. This mechanism is essential for maintaining fluid balance and blood pressure. The other options, including the glomerulus, proximal convoluted tubule, and loop of Henle, do not represent the primary action sites for aldosterone. Therefore, based on established physiological principles and consensus in the medical community, the most accurate answer is that aldosterone acts at the collecting duct.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
