It follows zero order kinetics\nopb. Not an hepatic enzyme inducer\nopc. It is excreted unchanged in urine\nopd. It is not teratogenic\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nPhenytoin is known to follow zero-order kinetics at therapeutic levels, meaning its elimination rate is constant and can become saturated, which supports option 'opa'. It is also a hepatic enzyme inducer, increasing the metabolism of other drugs, contradicting option 'opb'. Phenytoin is primarily metabolized in the liver and is not excreted unchanged in urine, which contradicts option 'opc'. Additionally, phenytoin is teratogenic and poses risks of fetal malformations, contradicting option 'opd'. Therefore, the only true statement is that phenytoin follows zero-order kinetics.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Phenytoin is a well-known antiepileptic drug that exhibits zero-order kinetics at therapeutic levels, meaning that its elimination does not follow the typical first-order kinetics where the rate of elimination is proportional to the drug concentration. This characteristic supports option 'opa'. Additionally, phenytoin is a hepatic enzyme inducer, which contradicts option 'opb'. It is primarily metabolized in the liver and is not excreted unchanged in urine, which contradicts option 'opc'. Furthermore, phenytoin is known to be teratogenic, posing risks of fetal malformations, which contradicts option 'opd'. Therefore, the only accurate statement regarding phenytoin is that it follows zero-order kinetics, making option 'opa' the correct choice.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
