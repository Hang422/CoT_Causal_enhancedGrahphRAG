Leydig cells\nopb. Seolie cells\nopc. Seminiferous tubules\nopd. Epididymis\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nTestosterone production is primarily contributed by Leydig cells, which are located in the interstitial tissue of the testes and are responsible for the majority of testosterone synthesis, accounting for approximately 95% of total production. Sertoli cells, while important for supporting spermatogenesis, do not produce significant amounts of testosterone (around 10%). The seminiferous tubules are primarily involved in sperm production rather than testosterone synthesis, contributing only about 20% to the overall testosterone levels. The epididymis is involved in sperm maturation and has no role in testosterone production (5%). Therefore, Leydig cells are the main source of testosterone in the male reproductive system.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "
