Ca transporter\nopb. Cu transporter\nopc. Zn transporter\nopd. Se transporter\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nMenke's Kinky Hair Syndrome is primarily caused by a defect in copper metabolism, specifically involving the copper transporter (ATP7A). This defect leads to impaired copper absorption and transport, resulting in symptoms such as abnormal hair texture, neurological issues, and connective tissue disorders. The reasoning chains consistently point to the Cu transporter as the key factor, supported by evidence linking hypocupremia (copper deficiency) to neurological symptoms and connective tissue diseases. Therefore, the correct answer is option opb: Cu transporter.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Menke's Kinky Hair Syndrome is a genetic disorder that is well-established to be caused by a defect in copper metabolism due to mutations in the ATP7A gene, which encodes a copper transporter. This defect leads to impaired absorption and transport of copper, resulting in various clinical manifestations including kinky hair, neurological problems, and connective tissue abnormalities. The consensus in the medical literature clearly identifies the copper transporter as the primary defect in this syndrome. Therefore, the most supported option is 'opb. Cu transporter'.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
