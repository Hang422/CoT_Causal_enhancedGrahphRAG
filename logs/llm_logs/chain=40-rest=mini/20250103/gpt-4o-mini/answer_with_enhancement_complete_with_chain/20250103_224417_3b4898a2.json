Meningitis\nopb. Pericarditis\nopc. Ileo-caecal tuberculosis\nopd. Adrenal involvement\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nSteroids are indicated in certain forms of tuberculosis to manage inflammation. In tuberculous meningitis, steroids are recommended to reduce inflammation of the meninges, which is supported by evidence showing their effectiveness in this context. Similarly, in tuberculous pericarditis, steroids are indicated to manage inflammation of the pericardium, as they can help prevent complications such as heart failure. However, in ileo-caecal tuberculosis, steroids are not typically used as they do not address the localized infection effectively and may worsen the condition. For adrenal involvement, while steroids mimic adrenal hormones, they are not primarily indicated for treating inflammation in adrenal tuberculosis. Therefore, the correct answer is that steroids are not indicated in ileo-caecal tuberculosis.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"In the context of tuberculosis, the use of steroids is primarily aimed at managing inflammatory complications associated with the disease. In tuberculous meningitis (opa) and tuberculous pericarditis (opb), steroids are indicated to reduce inflammation and prevent serious complications. However, in ileo-caecal tuberculosis (opc), the use of steroids is not recommended as they do not effectively address the localized infection and may exacerbate the condition. For adrenal involvement (opd), while steroids may be used to replace adrenal hormones, they are not indicated for treating the inflammation associated with adrenal tuberculosis. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is ileo-caecal tuberculosis, where steroids are not indicated. This aligns with the consensus in medical literature regarding the management of these conditions.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opc\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}",
