Duodenum\nopb. Ileum\nopc. Jejunum\nopd. Colon\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nVitamin B12 absorption occurs primarily in the ileum, where it binds to intrinsic factor, a glycoprotein secreted by the stomach. The reasoning chains correctly indicate that Vitamin B12 binds to intrinsic factor and is absorbed in the ileum, which is consistent with medical consensus. The evidence paths support the role of intrinsic factor in the uptake process in the ileum, confirming its critical function in Vitamin B12 absorption. Other options such as the duodenum, jejunum, and colon do not play a significant role in the absorption of Vitamin B12, as the ileum is the specific site for this process.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Vitamin B12 absorption is a well-established physiological process that primarily occurs in the ileum. The intrinsic factor, which is secreted by the stomach, binds to vitamin B12 in the intestinal lumen, and this complex is then absorbed in the ileum. The duodenum and jejunum do not play significant roles in this specific absorption process, and the colon is not involved in vitamin B12 absorption at all. Therefore, based on the consensus in medical literature, the ileum is the correct answer for where vitamin B12 intrinsic factor absorption occurs.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
