They are called as \"high ceiling\" diuretics\nopb. They act on Na+.K+.2Cl- symporter\nopc. They can cause hyperuricemia\nopd. Loop diuretics lead to hypercalcemia and hypomagnesimia\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nLoop diuretics are indeed referred to as 'high ceiling' diuretics due to their ability to produce a significant diuretic effect (Option a). They act on the Na+.K+.2Cl- symporter in the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle, inhibiting the reabsorption of sodium, potassium, and chloride (Option b). While loop diuretics can lead to hyperuricemia due to increased uric acid reabsorption, they primarily cause increased calcium and magnesium excretion, which typically results in hypocalcemia and hypomagnesemia, not hypercalcemia (Option d). Therefore, the statement that loop diuretics lead to hypercalcemia and hypomagnesemia is incorrect and contradicts established pharmacological consensus.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "
