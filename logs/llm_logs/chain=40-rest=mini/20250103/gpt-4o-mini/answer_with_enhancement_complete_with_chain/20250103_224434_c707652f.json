Chlorothiazide\nopb. Beta blockers\nopc. ACE inhibitors\nopd. Amlodipine\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nSpironolactone is a potassium-sparing diuretic that can lead to potassium retention and increased serum potassium levels, which raises the risk of hyperkalemia. ACE inhibitors, when used concurrently with spironolactone, can further increase potassium levels, making their combination contraindicated due to the heightened risk of hyperkalemia. Chlorothiazide, on the other hand, promotes potassium excretion, which may help balance potassium levels when used with spironolactone, thus not contraindicated. Beta blockers and amlodipine do not have a significant direct effect on potassium levels and are generally considered safe to use with spironolactone. Therefore, the drug that is contraindicated along with spironolactone is ACE inhibitors.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Spironolactone is a potassium-sparing diuretic that can lead to increased serum potassium levels, raising the risk of hyperkalemia. Among the options provided, ACE inhibitors are known to also increase potassium levels when used concurrently with spironolactone, which can lead to serious complications. Therefore, the combination of spironolactone and ACE inhibitors is contraindicated due to the heightened risk of hyperkalemia. In contrast, chlorothiazide promotes potassium excretion, which can help mitigate the potassium retention caused by spironolactone, making it safe to use together. Beta blockers and amlodipine do not significantly affect potassium levels and are generally safe to use with spironolactone. Thus, the most appropriate answer is that ACE inhibitors are contraindicated with spironolactone.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opc\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
