Hypoglycemia\nopb. Cinchonism\nopc. Arrhythmias\nopd. Sweating\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nQuinine, when administered intravenously, can lead to a condition known as cinchonism, which is characterized by symptoms such as tinnitus, headache, dizziness, and restlessness. This aligns with the second option, cinchonism, as the most likely cause of the patient's restlessness and sweating. While hypoglycemia is a potential concern due to quinine's effects on insulin secretion, it is less commonly associated with the specific symptoms of restlessness and sweating in this context. Cardiac arrhythmias can occur with quinine use, but they are not the primary cause of restlessness and sweating. Direct stimulation of sweat glands is not a well-documented effect of quinine. Therefore, the best-supported conclusion is that the patient's symptoms are most likely due to cinchonism.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Quinine is known to cause a range of side effects, and one of the well-documented reactions is cinchonism. This condition can manifest with symptoms such as restlessness, sweating, tinnitus, headache, and dizziness. In this case, the patient developed restlessness and sweating after intravenous administration of quinine, which aligns with the symptoms of cinchonism. While hypoglycemia could theoretically occur due to quinine's effects on insulin, it is not the most common cause of restlessness and sweating in this context. Arrhythmias are a potential risk with quinine, but they do not typically present with restlessness and sweating as primary symptoms. Direct stimulation of sweat glands is not a recognized effect of quinine. Therefore, the most likely cause of the patient's symptoms is cinchonism, making option opb the best-supported choice.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}",
