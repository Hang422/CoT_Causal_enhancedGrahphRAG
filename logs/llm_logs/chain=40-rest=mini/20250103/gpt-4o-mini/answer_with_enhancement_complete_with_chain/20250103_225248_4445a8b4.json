Quinine\nopb. Chloroquine\nopc. Mefloquine\nopd. Atovaquone\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nChloroquine is known to accumulate in the retinal pigment epithelium, leading to retinal pigmentation changes, which aligns with the consensus that it can cause retinal toxicity. Quinine has been associated with possible retinal toxicity, but its effect on pigmentation is unclear and not well-established. Mefloquine and Atovaquone have no known effects on retinal pigmentation, as supported by the consensus. Therefore, the most significant cause of retinal pigmentation among the options is Chloroquine.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "
