Stomach\nopb. Duodenum\nopc. Ileum\nopd. Duodenum + Jejunum\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nIron is primarily absorbed in the duodenum, which is the first part of the small intestine. The consensus indicates that approximately 90% of iron absorption occurs here, making it the major site for this process. While there is some absorption in the jejunum, it is significantly less, and the ileum is not a primary site for iron absorption. The stomach has minimal absorption of iron, confirming that it is not a primary site. Therefore, the most accurate option is 'Duodenum' (opb), as it aligns with the established physiological understanding of iron absorption.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "
