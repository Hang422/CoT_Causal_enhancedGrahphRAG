Androgen binding protein\nopb. Testosterone\nopc. LH\nopd. FSH\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nSertoli cells secrete androgen binding protein (ABP), which binds testosterone and helps maintain high local concentrations of testosterone in the seminiferous tubules, supporting spermatogenesis. Sertoli cells do not secrete testosterone; this hormone is produced by Leydig cells in response to luteinizing hormone (LH). Sertoli cells respond to follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) but do not secrete it. Therefore, the correct answer regarding what Sertoli cells secrete is androgen binding protein.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Sertoli cells are a type of somatic cell found in the seminiferous tubules of the testes. Their primary function is to support and nourish developing sperm cells during spermatogenesis. One of the key secretions of Sertoli cells is androgen binding protein (ABP), which plays a crucial role in binding testosterone and maintaining its high local concentration in the seminiferous tubules, thereby facilitating spermatogenesis. Sertoli cells do not produce testosterone; that function is performed by Leydig cells, which are stimulated by luteinizing hormone (LH). Additionally, Sertoli cells respond to follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) but do not secrete it. Given this information, the most accurate answer regarding what Sertoli cells secrete is androgen binding protein (ABP). Therefore, the correct option is opa.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
