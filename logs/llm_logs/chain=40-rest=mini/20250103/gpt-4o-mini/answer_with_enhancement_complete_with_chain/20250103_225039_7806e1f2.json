Stroma\nopb. Corpora albicans\nopc. Corpora lutea\nopd. Mature follicles\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nProgesterone production in the ovary is primarily by the corpus luteum, which is formed after ovulation from the mature follicle. The luteal cells within the corpus luteum are responsible for synthesizing progesterone, making this the primary source of the hormone during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. The stroma and corpora albicans do not significantly contribute to progesterone production; the stroma serves a supportive role, and the corpora albicans is a degenerated form of the corpus luteum with minimal hormone production. Evidence supports that the structure of the corpus luteum is directly associated with progesterone synthesis, confirming its role as the main site of progesterone production in the ovary.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "
