Monotherapy for acute episodes\nopb. Monitoring of serum concentration is not useful for guiding dose adjustment\nopc. Can result in leucocytosis\nopd. Can result in hypehyroidism on long term use\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nLithium is commonly used as a first-line treatment for acute manic episodes in bipolar disorder, supporting the option of monotherapy for acute episodes. Monitoring serum lithium concentration is crucial for guiding dose adjustments, as it helps prevent toxicity and ensures therapeutic levels, contradicting the claim that monitoring is not useful. Lithium can indeed cause leucocytosis, as it may stimulate bone marrow activity, which aligns with the evidence regarding its effect on white blood cell counts. However, long-term use of lithium is more commonly associated with hypothyroidism rather than hyperthyroidism, which is a critical correction. Therefore, the true statement regarding the use of lithium in manic-depressive psychosis is that it can be used as monotherapy for acute episodes.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Lithium is a well-established treatment for bipolar disorder, particularly effective in managing acute manic episodes. The consensus in the medical community supports its use as monotherapy for these acute episodes, making option 'opa' a strong candidate. Monitoring serum lithium levels is critical for ensuring therapeutic efficacy and avoiding toxicity, which directly contradicts option 'opb'. While lithium can cause leucocytosis, this is not as defining a characteristic as its role in treating acute mania. Furthermore, long-term use of lithium is more commonly associated with hypothyroidism rather than hyperthyroidism, which invalidates option 'opd'. Therefore, the most accurate statement regarding lithium's use in manic-depressive psychosis is that it can be used as monotherapy for acute episodes.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}",
