Interleukin-6\nopb. Interleukin-6 receptor\nopc. Interleukin-5\nopd. Interleukin-5 receptor\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nTocilizumab is a monoclonal antibody that specifically targets the interleukin-6 receptor (IL-6R). It binds to the IL-6R, preventing interleukin-6 (IL-6) from interacting with its receptor, thereby blocking IL-6 signaling. This action reduces inflammation and alleviates symptoms associated with rheumatoid arthritis. The reasoning chains for options 'opb' (Interleukin-6 receptor) are consistent with this consensus, while options 'opa' (Interleukin-6), 'opc' (Interleukin-5), and 'opd' (Interleukin-5 receptor) are incorrect as tocilizumab does not target these molecules. Evidence paths confirming the interaction of tocilizumab with the IL-6 receptor further support this conclusion.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

By binding to the IL-6R, it prevents interleukin-6 from interacting with its receptor, effectively blocking IL-6 signaling. This mechanism is crucial in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, as IL-6 is a pro-inflammatory cytokine involved in the disease's pathophysiology. The other options, which include interleukin-6 itself and interleukin-5 and its receptor, are not relevant to the action of tocilizumab. Therefore, the most accurate answer is that tocilizumab targets the interleukin-6 receptor (option opb).\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
