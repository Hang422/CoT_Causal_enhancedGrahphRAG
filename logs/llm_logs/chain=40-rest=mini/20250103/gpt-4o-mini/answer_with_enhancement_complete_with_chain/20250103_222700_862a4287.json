Anti depressants\nopb. Anti psychotics\nopc. Anti epileptics\nopd. Mood stabilizers\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nSchizophrenia is primarily treated with antipsychotics, which target dopamine dysregulation and are effective in reducing positive symptoms such as hallucinations and delusions. The reasoning chains confirm that antipsychotics are the mainstay of treatment, with a high consensus on their efficacy (95% for dopamine receptor antagonism and symptom control). While antidepressants may be used for comorbid depression, they are not the primary treatment for schizophrenia (60%). Antiepileptics and mood stabilizers are not standard treatments for schizophrenia, although they may have some role in managing mood symptoms or comorbid conditions (50% and 55% respectively). Evidence paths support the association of antipsychotic agents with the physiological aspects of schizophrenia, reinforcing their primary role in treatment.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "
