Cinchonism\nopb. Hyperglycemia\nopc. Hypoglycemia\nopd. Hypokalemia\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nQuinine is known to cause cinchonism, which includes symptoms such as sweating and palpitations due to its effects on the cardiovascular system and central nervous system. The reasoning chain for cinchonism is supported by the consensus that quinine can lead to increased heart rate and other cardiac effects. The chain for hypoglycemia is less supported, as quinine does not typically cause increased insulin secretion leading to hypoglycemia. Hypokalemia is a potential side effect of various medications but is not a direct consequence of quinine use. Hyperglycemia is also not a recognized effect of quinine. Therefore, the most likely cause of sweating and palpitations in this context is cinchonism.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Quinine is known to cause cinchonism, which is a syndrome characterized by symptoms such as tinnitus, headache, nausea, sweating, and palpitations. The symptoms experienced by the patient (sweating and palpitations) align with this known side effect of quinine. Other options such as hyperglycemia, hypoglycemia, and hypokalemia are not typically associated with quinine use. Therefore, the most likely cause of the symptoms in this patient is cinchonism, which is a well-documented adverse effect of quinine. Given the clarity of the evidence supporting cinchonism as the cause, I am confident in this conclusion.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
