Argininosuccinate synthetase\nopb. Carbamoyl Phosphate synthetase (CPS-I)\nopc. Ornithine transcarbamoylase (OTC)\nopd. Ornithine amino transferase\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nIn the context of enzyme deficiencies leading to hyperammonemia, the following consensus points are relevant: 1) Argininosuccinate synthetase deficiency, Carbamoyl Phosphate synthetase (CPS-I) deficiency, and Ornithine transcarbamoylase (OTC) deficiency all disrupt the urea cycle, leading to ammonia accumulation and hyperammonemia. 2) Ornithine amino transferase deficiency, however, is not directly involved in the urea cycle and does not typically result in significant ammonia accumulation, thus hyperammonemia is not a common feature. Therefore, the correct answer to the question is Ornithine amino transferase deficiency, as it is the exception among the listed options.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The question asks which enzyme deficiency does not commonly lead to hyperammonemia. Argininosuccinate synthetase deficiency, Carbamoyl Phosphate synthetase (CPS-I) deficiency, and Ornithine transcarbamoylase (OTC) deficiency are all known to disrupt the urea cycle, resulting in the accumulation of ammonia and subsequent hyperammonemia. In contrast, Ornithine amino transferase deficiency is not directly involved in the urea cycle and does not typically lead to significant ammonia accumulation. Therefore, based on established biochemical principles and consensus, the exception among the listed options is Ornithine amino transferase deficiency. This reasoning aligns with the enhanced information provided, confirming that hyperammonemia is not a common feature of this deficiency.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
