Haloperidol\nopb. Imipramine\nopc. Alprazolam\nopd. Methylphenidate\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nThe drug of choice for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is methylphenidate. Methylphenidate works by increasing dopamine and norepinephrine levels in the brain, which improves attention and focus while reducing hyperactivity. This aligns with the consensus that stimulants, particularly methylphenidate and amphetamines, are first-line treatments for ADHD. In contrast, haloperidol is an antipsychotic that blocks dopamine receptors and is not typically used for ADHD. Imipramine, a tricyclic antidepressant, may have some efficacy in ADHD but is not considered a first-line treatment. Alprazolam, a benzodiazepine, is primarily used for anxiety and does not effectively treat ADHD symptoms. Therefore, the most appropriate choice based on current medical consensus is methylphenidate.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The core medical principle regarding the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is that stimulant medications are the first-line treatment options. Methylphenidate is a well-established stimulant that increases dopamine and norepinephrine levels in the brain, which is crucial for improving attention and reducing hyperactivity. The other options provided (haloperidol, imipramine, and alprazolam) do not align with the current treatment guidelines for ADHD. Haloperidol is an antipsychotic, imipramine is a tricyclic antidepressant with limited use in ADHD, and alprazolam is a benzodiazepine primarily used for anxiety. Therefore, based on the consensus in pharmacology and psychiatry, methylphenidate is the drug of choice for ADHD.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
