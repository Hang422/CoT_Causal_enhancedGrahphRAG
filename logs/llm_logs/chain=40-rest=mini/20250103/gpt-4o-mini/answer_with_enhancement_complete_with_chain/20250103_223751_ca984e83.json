Single dose in ascariasis\nopb. Immunostimulant\nopc. Paralysis of worms by depolarisation\nopd. Immunodepressant in high doses\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nLevamisole is primarily used as an anthelmintic agent for treating ascariasis, typically administered in a single dose, which aligns with the consensus that it is effective for this purpose. It also acts as an immunostimulant, enhancing the immune response, which is well-supported in the literature. Levamisole causes paralysis of worms through depolarization of their muscle cells, confirming its mechanism of action. However, the claim that it acts as an immunodepressant in high doses is not widely accepted; while there may be some immunosuppressive effects at high doses, this is not its primary or intended use. Therefore, the correct answer to the question is that Levamisole is not used as an immunodepressant in high doses.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

It also functions as an immunostimulant (option opb), enhancing the immune response, which is well-documented. The mechanism of action involves causing paralysis of worms through depolarization (option opc), which is consistent with its pharmacological profile. However, the assertion that it acts as an immunodepressant in high doses (option opd) is not widely supported in the literature; while there may be some immunosuppressive effects at high doses, this is not its primary use or indication.
