      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in the field of Biochemistry.\n                    You are a medical expert determining the final answer.\n\n            ### Instructions:\n            - Use standard medical knowledge as the primary guide.\n            - Consider enhanced information only if it aligns with consensus.\n            - If conflicting or unclear, present the most likely correct answer based on known facts.\n            - It's acceptable to show moderate confidence if the question is complex, but still choose one best answer.\n\n\n                    ### Question\n                    Essential amino acids are all except:\n\n                    ### Options\n                    opa. Leucine\nopb. Lysine\nopc. Methionine\nopd. Proline\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nAmong the options provided, Leucine, Lysine, and Methionine are all classified as essential amino acids, meaning they cannot be synthesized by the body and must be obtained through diet. Proline, however, is considered a non-essential amino acid because the body can synthesize it from other compounds. Therefore, the correct answer to the question is Proline, as it is not an essential amino acid. The reasoning aligns with the consensus in biochemistry regarding amino acid classification.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "
