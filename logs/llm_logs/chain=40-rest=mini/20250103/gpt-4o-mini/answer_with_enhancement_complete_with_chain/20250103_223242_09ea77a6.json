Family of three seven transmembrane protein\nopb. Activated by thrombin\nopc. Releases PGE2\nopd. Protects epithelial cells\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nProtease activated receptors (PARs) are a family of four seven transmembrane proteins, not three, which makes option (a) incorrect. They are indeed activated by thrombin (option b), which is a well-established fact in the literature. While PARs can influence the release of various mediators, including PGE2, the mechanism is complex and not definitively established as a primary function (option c), thus making it less clear. However, PARs do play a role in cellular defense and can protect epithelial cells (option d), aligning with their function in tissue repair and inflammation. Therefore, the only incorrect statement is option (a).\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "
