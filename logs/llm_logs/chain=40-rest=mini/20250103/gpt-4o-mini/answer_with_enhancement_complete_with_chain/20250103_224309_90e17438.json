Fever\nopb. Peptic ulcer\nopc. Unstable angina\nopd. Myalgia\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nAspirin is contraindicated primarily in patients with peptic ulcers due to its ability to inhibit prostaglandins, which are crucial for maintaining gastric mucosal protection, thereby increasing the risk of gastric bleeding and exacerbating existing ulcers. The antiplatelet effect of aspirin also raises the risk of bleeding complications in these patients. In contrast, aspirin is beneficial in managing unstable angina due to its antiplatelet properties, and it is used for fever and myalgia management, making options related to fever and myalgia not contraindicated. Therefore, the correct answer is that aspirin is contraindicated in peptic ulcer.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Aspirin is known to inhibit prostaglandins, which play a crucial role in protecting the gastric mucosa. This inhibition can lead to an increased risk of gastric bleeding, particularly in patients with peptic ulcers. Therefore, the use of aspirin is contraindicated in individuals with peptic ulcers due to the potential for exacerbating the condition and increasing the risk of complications. In contrast, aspirin is commonly used to manage fever and myalgia, and it is beneficial in the treatment of unstable angina due to its antiplatelet effects. Thus, the most appropriate answer, based on established medical knowledge, is that aspirin is contraindicated in peptic ulcer disease.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
