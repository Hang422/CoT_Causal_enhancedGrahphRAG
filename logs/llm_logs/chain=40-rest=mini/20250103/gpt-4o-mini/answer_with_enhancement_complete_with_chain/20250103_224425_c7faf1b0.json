Methotrexate\nopb. Doxorubicin\nopc. Cisplatin\nopd. Busulfan\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nPulmonary fibrosis can be a complication of various medications, particularly those with known lung toxicity. Methotrexate is an immunosuppressive agent that can lead to pulmonary toxicity, including pulmonary fibrosis, though this is less common compared to other agents. Doxorubicin is primarily known for cardiotoxicity, with pulmonary fibrosis being a rare side effect. Cisplatin is associated with nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity, and while it can cause lung toxicity, it is not a common cause of pulmonary fibrosis. Busulfan, an alkylating agent, is well-documented to cause pulmonary fibrosis, making it the most likely option among those listed. Therefore, the strongest consensus aligns with Busulfan as a known cause of pulmonary fibrosis, supported by its established lung toxicity profile.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Pulmonary fibrosis is a known complication of certain chemotherapeutic agents, particularly those that have a direct toxic effect on lung tissue. Among the options provided, Methotrexate is known to cause pulmonary toxicity, including pulmonary fibrosis, but this is less common compared to other agents. Doxorubicin is primarily associated with cardiotoxicity, and while it can have pulmonary effects, pulmonary fibrosis is rare. Cisplatin is more recognized for nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity, and while it can cause lung toxicity, it is not a common cause of pulmonary fibrosis. Busulfan, on the other hand, is well-documented in the literature as a cause of pulmonary fibrosis due to its alkylating properties and the resultant lung toxicity. Therefore, based on the consensus in medical literature regarding the agents listed, Busulfan is the most likely cause of pulmonary fibrosis. This conclusion is supported by its established profile of causing lung damage, making it the best-supported option among those listed.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}",
