Fatty acids\nopb. Ketone bodies\nopc. Glucose\nopd. Any of the above\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nIn normal conditions, cardiac muscle primarily utilizes fatty acids as its main source of energy through beta-oxidation, which is responsible for approximately 60-70% of ATP production. Ketone bodies can serve as a secondary energy source, especially during periods of fasting or low carbohydrate intake, contributing around 20-30% of ATP production. Glucose is also metabolized, primarily through glycolysis, but it is less favored under normal conditions, contributing about 10-20% of ATP production. Therefore, while all three substrates can be used for energy, fatty acids are the primary source, making the best answer 'Any of the above' as all can contribute to ATP production in varying degrees.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

Ketone bodies and glucose can also be utilized, but to a lesser extent, with ketone bodies contributing around 20-30% and glucose about 10-20%. While all three substrates can provide energy, fatty acids are the predominant source. However, since the question asks for the source of energy at normal conditions and acknowledges that all three can be utilized, the best answer is 'Any of the above' as it encompasses the fact that all three substrates can contribute to ATP production, albeit in different proportions. Therefore, the most accurate response is that all options are valid sources of energy for cardiac muscle, making 'Any of the above' the correct choice.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
