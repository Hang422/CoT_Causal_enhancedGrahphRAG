All of the following are true about heparin except-\n\n                    ### Options\n                    opa. Weakest acid found in living things\nopb. Most commercial preparations of heparin now utilize pig intestinal slimes\nopc. Act via Antithrombin activation\nopd. Produce thrombocytopenia\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nHeparin is a widely used anticoagulant that primarily acts by activating Antithrombin, which inhibits thrombin and factor Xa, making option (opc) true. Most commercial preparations of heparin are derived from pig intestinal mucosa, confirming option (opb) as true. Heparin can cause thrombocytopenia, a decrease in platelet count, which makes option (opd) also true. However, option (opa) stating that heparin is the 'weakest acid found in living things' is misleading; heparin is a glycosaminoglycan and not classified as an acid in this context. Therefore, the correct answer to the question is option (opa), as it does not accurately represent heparin's properties.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "
