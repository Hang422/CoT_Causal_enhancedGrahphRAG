Glucocoicoids\nopb. Mineralcoicoids\nopc. Aldosterone\nopd. Androgens\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nThe zona reticularis of the adrenal cortex primarily produces androgens, such as dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and androstenedione. This aligns with the consensus that the major hormone secreted by this layer is androgens, making option 'opd. Androgens' the correct answer. While the zona reticularis can produce some glucocorticoids, this is not its primary function, and it does not produce mineralocorticoids or aldosterone, which are primarily secreted by the zona glomerulosa. Therefore, the reasoning chains for glucocorticoids, mineralocorticoids, and aldosterone have been adjusted or removed to reflect this consensus.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The zona reticularis of the adrenal cortex is primarily responsible for the production of androgens, such as dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and androstenedione. This is well-established in medical literature, and it is clear that while the adrenal cortex as a whole produces glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids, these are not the primary hormones secreted by the zona reticularis. The zona glomerulosa is responsible for mineralocorticoids like aldosterone, while the zona fasciculata primarily produces glucocorticoids. Therefore, the most accurate answer, based on consensus and enhanced information, is that the major hormone secreted by the zona reticularis is androgens. Thus, the correct option is 'opd. Androgens'.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
