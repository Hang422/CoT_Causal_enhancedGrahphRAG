Increases liver glycogenolysis\nopb. Causes broachiolar constriction\nopc. Evokes extrasystoles in the heart\nopd. Produces restlessness and anxiety\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nEpinephrine, when administered intravenously in high doses, has several well-documented actions. It increases liver glycogenolysis, leading to elevated blood glucose levels, which is consistent with its role as a sympathomimetic agent. However, it causes bronchodilation, not bronchiolar constriction, which contradicts the option suggesting otherwise. Epinephrine can evoke extrasystoles due to its stimulatory effects on the heart, increasing heart rate and contractility. Additionally, it can produce restlessness and anxiety as a result of heightened sympathetic activity. Therefore, the option that is not an action of epinephrine is 'Causes bronchiolar constriction.'\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

It increases liver glycogenolysis, which raises blood glucose levels, and it can evoke extrasystoles due to its stimulatory effects on the heart. Additionally, it can produce feelings of restlessness and anxiety as a result of increased sympathetic nervous system activity. However, one of the key actions of epinephrine is bronchodilation, not bronchiolar constriction. Therefore, the statement that epinephrine causes bronchiolar constriction is incorrect. This aligns with the consensus in pharmacology regarding the actions of epinephrine. Thus, the option that is not an action of epinephrine is 'Causes bronchiolar constriction.'\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
