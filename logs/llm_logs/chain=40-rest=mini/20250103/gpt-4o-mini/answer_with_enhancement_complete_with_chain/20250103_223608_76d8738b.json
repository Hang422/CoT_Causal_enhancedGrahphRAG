None of the above\nopb. Albumin\nopc. Globulins\nopd. Chylomicrons\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nFree fatty acids in the bloodstream are primarily transported bound to albumin, which facilitates their delivery to cells for oxidation in the mitochondria. The reasoning chain for option B (Albumin) is correct: free fatty acids are bound to albumin in blood, transported to cells, and then enter mitochondria for oxidation. Options C (Globulins) and D (Chylomicrons) are incorrect as globulins primarily transport hormones and vitamins, while chylomicrons are responsible for transporting dietary lipids from the intestines. Option A (None of the above) is also incorrect since albumin is indeed the primary transporter. Therefore, the correct answer is option B, supported by the consensus that albumin is essential for the transport of free fatty acids in the bloodstream.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Free fatty acids in the bloodstream are primarily transported bound to albumin, which is a well-established fact in biochemistry. Albumin serves as the main carrier for free fatty acids, facilitating their transport to tissues where they can undergo oxidation in the mitochondria. The other options, such as globulins and chylomicrons, do not play a significant role in the transport of free fatty acids for mitochondrial oxidation. Globulins are more associated with the transport of hormones and vitamins, while chylomicrons are involved in the transport of dietary lipids from the intestines. Therefore, the consensus strongly supports that albumin is the correct answer for the transport of free fatty acids. Given this reasoning, the best-supported option is B (Albumin).\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
