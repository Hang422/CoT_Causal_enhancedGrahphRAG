PAS\nopb. Ethionamide\nopc. Cycloserine\nopd. Pyrazinamide\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nHypothyroidism can be caused by certain anti-tubercular drugs. Ethionamide is known to inhibit thyroid hormone synthesis, leading to reduced thyroid hormone levels and potentially causing hypothyroidism, which aligns with the reasoning chain indicating an 85% likelihood. PAS (p-Aminosalicylic Acid) may interfere with thyroid function, but its impact on thyroid hormone levels is unclear, leading to a lower confidence of 60%. Cycloserine and Pyrazinamide have no known effects on thyroid function, making them unlikely to cause hypothyroidism, as indicated by their respective chains with a 20% likelihood. Therefore, Ethionamide is the most likely anti-tubercular drug to cause hypothyroidism.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Hypothyroidism can be caused by certain anti-tubercular drugs, and among the options provided, Ethionamide is the most well-documented drug associated with this condition. Ethionamide inhibits thyroid hormone synthesis, which can lead to reduced levels of thyroid hormones and subsequently hypothyroidism. While PAS may have some effects on thyroid function, the evidence is less clear and does not strongly support a direct link to hypothyroidism. Cycloserine and Pyrazinamide are not known to affect thyroid function significantly. Therefore, based on the available evidence and consensus in the field, Ethionamide is the most likely cause of hypothyroidism among the listed anti-tubercular drugs.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
