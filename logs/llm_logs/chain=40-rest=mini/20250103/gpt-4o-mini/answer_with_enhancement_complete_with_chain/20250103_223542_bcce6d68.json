Nimodipine\nopb. Amlodipine\nopc. Diltiazem\nopd. Verapamil\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nNimodipine is a calcium channel blocker specifically indicated for the prevention of cerebral vasospasm following subarachnoid hemorrhage. It promotes vasodilation and has been shown to improve outcomes in patients with this condition. In contrast, amlodipine, diltiazem, and verapamil, while also calcium channel blockers, primarily cause systemic vasodilation and lower blood pressure without specific efficacy against cerebral vasospasm. Therefore, they are not indicated for subarachnoid hemorrhage management. The evidence supports that nimodipine's unique properties make it the preferred choice in this clinical scenario.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Nimodipine is a calcium channel blocker that is specifically indicated for the prevention of cerebral vasospasm following subarachnoid hemorrhage. This is a critical aspect of managing patients who have experienced this type of hemorrhage, as vasospasm can lead to significant morbidity and mortality. The other options, amlodipine, diltiazem, and verapamil, while they are also calcium channel blockers, do not have the same targeted effect on cerebral vasospasm and are primarily used for systemic hypertension and other cardiovascular conditions. Therefore, based on the consensus in medical literature and guidelines, nimodipine is the most appropriate choice for this indication.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
