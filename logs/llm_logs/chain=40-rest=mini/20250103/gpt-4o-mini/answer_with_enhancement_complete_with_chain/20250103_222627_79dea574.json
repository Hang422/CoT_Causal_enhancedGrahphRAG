Which of the following enzymes is defective?\n\n                    ### Options\n                    opa. Fructokinase\nopb. Aldolase A\nopc. Aldolase B\nopd. Sucrase\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nThe symptoms of vomiting, lethargy, and severe jaundice in a 6-month-old baby after the introduction of fruit juice suggest a metabolic disorder related to fructose metabolism. The key enzyme involved in the metabolism of fructose is Aldolase B. A deficiency in Aldolase B leads to hereditary fructose intolerance, which can cause severe symptoms upon fructose ingestion, including the accumulation of toxic metabolites that result in the observed clinical manifestations. In contrast, deficiencies in Fructokinase and Aldolase A are associated with milder symptoms and are less likely to cause severe jaundice. Sucrase is not directly involved in fructose metabolism and is therefore unrelated to the symptoms presented. Thus, the most likely defective enzyme in this case is Aldolase B.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

The symptoms align with hereditary fructose intolerance, which is caused by a deficiency in Aldolase B. This enzyme is crucial for the proper metabolism of fructose, and its deficiency leads to the accumulation of toxic metabolites when fructose is ingested, resulting in severe symptoms. In contrast, deficiencies in Fructokinase and Aldolase A are associated with milder symptoms and do not typically present with severe jaundice. Sucrase is not directly involved in fructose metabolism and is therefore not relevant to this case.
