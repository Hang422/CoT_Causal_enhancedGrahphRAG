Mannitol\nopb. Spironolactone\nopc. Furosemide\nopd. Hydrochlorothiazide\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nMannitol is an osmotic diuretic that increases plasma volume, which can worsen cardiac failure, making it contraindicated in this condition. Spironolactone is a potassium-sparing diuretic that reduces fluid overload and is beneficial in cardiac failure. Furosemide, a loop diuretic, also reduces fluid overload and is beneficial in managing cardiac failure. Hydrochlorothiazide, while generally beneficial in mild cardiac failure, is less effective in severe cases. Therefore, the diuretic contraindicated in the presence of cardiac failure is Mannitol.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"In the context of cardiac failure, the choice of diuretics is critical. Mannitol, an osmotic diuretic, increases plasma volume and can exacerbate fluid overload, making it contraindicated in patients with cardiac failure. On the other hand, spironolactone and furosemide are beneficial in managing fluid overload associated with cardiac failure. Hydrochlorothiazide can be used in mild cases but is less effective in severe heart failure. Therefore, the consensus clearly indicates that Mannitol is the diuretic that should not be used in the presence of cardiac failure due to its potential to worsen the condition.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
