Highly specific irreversible and noncompetitive carbonic anhydrase inhibitor\nopb. Highly specific irreversible and competitive carbonic anhydrase inhibitor.\nopc. Highly specific reversible and competitive carbonic anhydrose inhibitor\nopd. Highly specific reversible and non-competitive carbonic anhydrase inhibitor.\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nBrinzolamide is a highly specific reversible and competitive carbonic anhydrase inhibitor. The consensus in pharmacology indicates that brinzolamide binds reversibly to the active site of carbonic anhydrase, leading to competitive inhibition of the enzyme. This aligns with the reasoning chain that identifies reversible binding and competitive inhibition as the correct characteristics of brinzolamide. The retrieved evidence path confirms its classification as a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, but does not provide additional relevant details for this specific question.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Brinzolamide is classified as a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, specifically targeting the enzyme to reduce intraocular pressure in conditions like glaucoma. The enhanced information clearly states that brinzolamide is a highly specific reversible and competitive carbonic anhydrase inhibitor. This aligns with established pharmacological knowledge, which indicates that brinzolamide binds reversibly to the active site of carbonic anhydrase, leading to competitive inhibition. Therefore, the most accurate characterization of brinzolamide is that it is a reversible and competitive inhibitor, making option 'opc' the correct choice. There is no indication of irreversible or non-competitive characteristics in the consensus literature.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opc\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
