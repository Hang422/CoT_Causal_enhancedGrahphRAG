Carbamazepine\nopb. Vigabatrin\nopc. Sodium valproate\nopd. Lamotrigine\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nCarbamazepine, sodium valproate, and lamotrigine are all established mood stabilizers used in the treatment of bipolar disorder, with strong evidence supporting their efficacy. Vigabatrin, while it increases GABA levels by inhibiting GABA transaminase, is not typically indicated for mood stabilization and is primarily used for epilepsy. Therefore, the correct answer is Vigabatrin, as it is not indicated for the treatment of bipolar disorder.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"In the treatment of bipolar disorder, mood stabilizers are crucial for managing manic and depressive episodes. Carbamazepine, sodium valproate, and lamotrigine are all well-established medications used for this purpose, with significant evidence supporting their efficacy in stabilizing mood. On the other hand, Vigabatrin is primarily an anticonvulsant used for epilepsy and is not indicated for the treatment of bipolar disorder. Therefore, based on established medical knowledge and consensus, Vigabatrin is the drug that does not belong in the treatment regimen for bipolar disorder.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
