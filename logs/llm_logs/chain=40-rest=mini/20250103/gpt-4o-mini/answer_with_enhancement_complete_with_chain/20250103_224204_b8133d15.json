Striated\nopb. Large T tubules\nopc. Troponin system present\nopd. Caldesmon is impoant regulatory protein\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nCardiac muscle is characterized by several key features: it is striated, similar to skeletal muscle, which confirms option (a) as correct. Cardiac muscle has large T tubules that facilitate efficient calcium handling, supporting option (b) as correct. The presence of a troponin system in cardiac muscle is crucial for the regulation of contraction, making option (c) correct as well. However, option (d) is incorrect; caldesmon is not a significant regulatory protein in cardiac muscle, as cardiac muscle contraction is primarily regulated by the troponin-tropomyosin complex, not caldesmon. Therefore, the correct answer to the question is option (d).\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "
