Chloroquine\nopb. Betamethasone\nopc. Chloramphenicol\nopd. Zidovudine\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nChloroquine is an antimalarial drug that is known to cause myopathy, thus it does not fit the criteria. Betamethasone, a corticosteroid, can lead to muscle weakness and myopathy, so it is also not suitable. Chloramphenicol, an antibiotic, has no known association with myopathy, making it a potential candidate. Zidovudine, an antiretroviral drug, is recognized for causing myopathy. Therefore, the drug that does not cause myopathy is Chloramphenicol.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"To determine which drug does not cause myopathy, we evaluate each option based on known pharmacological effects. Chloroquine is known to cause myopathy, particularly in long-term use. Betamethasone, a corticosteroid, can lead to muscle weakness and myopathy as well. Chloramphenicol, an antibiotic, does not have a well-documented association with myopathy, making it a potential candidate. Zidovudine is recognized for causing myopathy, especially in long-term use. Therefore, the most likely correct answer is Chloramphenicol, as it is the only drug listed that does not have a significant association with myopathy. This conclusion aligns with the enhanced information provided, which supports the idea that Chloramphenicol is the drug that does not cause myopathy.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opc\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
