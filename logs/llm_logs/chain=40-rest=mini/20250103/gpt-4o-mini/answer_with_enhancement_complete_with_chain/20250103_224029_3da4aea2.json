Retro bulbar neuritis\nopb. Deafness\nopc. Red urine\nopd. Peripheral neuritis\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nEthambutol is known to cause retrobulbar neuritis, which can lead to optic nerve toxicity and visual disturbances, making option (opa) correct. The evidence supports this association with the optic nerve. Ethambutol does not typically cause deafness (opb), as its primary toxicity is not directed at the auditory system, thus this option is less supported. While ethambutol can cause red urine (opc) due to its excretion, this is not a direct effect of the drug but rather a result of its metabolism and is not clinically significant. Peripheral neuritis (opd) is a possible side effect, but it is less commonly associated with ethambutol compared to retrobulbar neuritis. Therefore, the most consensus-supported option is (opa) retrobulbar neuritis.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Ethambutol is primarily known for its potential to cause retrobulbar neuritis, which can lead to visual disturbances due to optic nerve toxicity. This aligns with the consensus in pharmacology regarding the side effects of ethambutol. While peripheral neuritis is a possible side effect, it is not as commonly associated with ethambutol as retrobulbar neuritis. Deafness is not a recognized side effect of ethambutol, and while red urine can occur due to the drug's metabolism, it is not a clinically significant effect. Therefore, the best-supported option based on medical consensus is retrobulbar neuritis (opa).\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}",
