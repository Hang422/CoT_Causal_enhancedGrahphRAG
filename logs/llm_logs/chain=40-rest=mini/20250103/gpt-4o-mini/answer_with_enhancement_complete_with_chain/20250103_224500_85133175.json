Bromocriptine\nopb. Levodopa\nopc. Amantadine\nopd. Metoclopramide\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nHyperprolactinemia is primarily associated with medications that block dopamine receptors, leading to increased prolactin secretion. Metoclopramide is a dopamine receptor antagonist, which can cause hyperprolactinemia due to its mechanism of action. In contrast, Bromocriptine is a dopamine agonist that decreases prolactin secretion, making it unlikely to cause hyperprolactinemia. Levodopa, as a dopamine precursor, and Amantadine, which stimulates dopamine release, also lead to increased dopamine levels and are unlikely to cause hyperprolactinemia. Therefore, the only option that aligns with the consensus on causing hyperprolactinemia is Metoclopramide.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

Among the options provided, Metoclopramide is a known dopamine receptor antagonist, which can indeed cause hyperprolactinemia due to its mechanism of action. In contrast, Bromocriptine is a dopamine agonist that reduces prolactin levels, making it unlikely to cause hyperprolactinemia. Levodopa and Amantadine, while related to dopamine, do not typically lead to increased prolactin levels.
