B1\nopb. B2\nopc. B6\nopd. B12\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nWernicke's encephalopathy is primarily associated with thiamine deficiency, which is vitamin B1. The condition is often seen in individuals with chronic alcoholism, leading to malnutrition and subsequent vitamin deficiencies. The reasoning chains consistently point to thiamine deficiency as the underlying cause of the neurological symptoms, including confusion, ataxia, and ocular abnormalities. Evidence paths confirm the relationship between Wernicke's encephalopathy and thiamine deficiency, particularly in the context of chronic alcoholism and malnutrition. Therefore, the major vitamin deficiency in Wernicke's encephalopathy is vitamin B1.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Wernicke's encephalopathy is a neurological condition that is primarily caused by a deficiency in thiamine, also known as vitamin B1. This condition is most commonly associated with chronic alcoholism, where individuals often experience malnutrition leading to various vitamin deficiencies. The symptoms of Wernicke's encephalopathy, such as confusion, ataxia, and ocular abnormalities, are directly linked to the lack of thiamine. The consensus in the medical literature strongly supports that the major vitamin deficiency in this condition is indeed vitamin B1. Other vitamins listed (B2, B6, and B12) are not primarily associated with Wernicke's encephalopathy. Therefore, the best-supported option is vitamin B1 (thiamine).\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
