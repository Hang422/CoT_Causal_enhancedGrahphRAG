Vitamin A\nopb. Vitamin K\nopc. Vitamin E\nopd. Vitamin D\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nVitamin K is the only fat-soluble vitamin identified to function as a coenzyme. It plays a crucial role in the gamma-carboxylation of certain proteins, which is essential for blood coagulation. The reasoning for Vitamin A, E, and D being coenzymes is incorrect; Vitamin A is involved in vision and skin health but does not function as a coenzyme, Vitamin E primarily acts as an antioxidant protecting cell membranes, and Vitamin D is important for calcium homeostasis and bone health, but neither serves as a coenzyme. The evidence paths related to Vitamin K's role in blood coagulation support its function as a coenzyme.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Vitamin K is well-established in the medical literature as functioning as a coenzyme, particularly in the process of gamma-carboxylation of certain proteins necessary for blood coagulation. This role is critical for the activation of clotting factors, which is a clear indication of its coenzyme function. In contrast, Vitamin A is primarily involved in vision and skin health, Vitamin E acts mainly as an antioxidant, and Vitamin D is crucial for calcium metabolism and bone health, but none of these vitamins serve as coenzymes. Therefore, based on the consensus in biochemistry regarding the functions of these fat-soluble vitamins, Vitamin K is the only one that fits the criteria of functioning as a coenzyme. The enhanced information aligns with this consensus, reinforcing the conclusion that Vitamin K is the correct answer.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
