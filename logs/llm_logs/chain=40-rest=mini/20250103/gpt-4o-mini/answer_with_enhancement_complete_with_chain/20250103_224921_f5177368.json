Retinol\nopb. Retinal\nopc. Retinoic acids\nopd. All of the above\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nVitamin A is crucial for various biological functions, including vision, immune function, and gene regulation. It exists in several forms: Retinol, Retinal, and Retinoic acids. Retinol is the alcohol form, Retinal is the aldehyde form essential for vision, and Retinoic acids are involved in regulating gene expression. All these forms are interrelated and contribute to the overall functions of vitamin A. Therefore, the correct answer is 'All of the above' (option d), as each form plays a significant role in the physiological processes associated with vitamin A.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "
