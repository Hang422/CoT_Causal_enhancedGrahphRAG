Proximal tubule\nopb. Distal tubules\nopc. Loop of Henle\nopd. Collecting duct\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nAldosterone primarily acts on the distal tubules and collecting duct of the nephron. It promotes sodium reabsorption and potassium excretion in these segments, leading to increased water retention and overall fluid balance. While there is some sodium reabsorption in the proximal tubule and loop of Henle, the primary and most significant actions of aldosterone occur in the distal tubules and collecting duct, where it exerts about 85% and 95% of its effects, respectively. The retrieved evidence regarding aldosterone's role in body fluid retention supports this understanding, emphasizing its importance in regulating electrolyte balance and blood pressure.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Aldosterone is a steroid hormone produced by the adrenal cortex that plays a crucial role in regulating sodium and potassium levels in the body. Its primary action occurs in the distal tubules and collecting duct of the nephron, where it promotes sodium reabsorption and potassium excretion. While there is some activity in the proximal tubule and loop of Henle, the significant effects of aldosterone are concentrated in the distal tubules and collecting duct. Given the options provided, the best-supported answer is that aldosterone acts on the distal tubules and collecting duct, with a stronger emphasis on the collecting duct. Therefore, the most appropriate choice is 'opd. Collecting duct.' This aligns with the consensus in pharmacology and nephrology regarding aldosterone's mechanism of action.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
