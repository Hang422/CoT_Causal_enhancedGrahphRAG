Bromocriptine\nopb. Haloperidol\nopc. Reserpine\nopd. Chlorpromazine\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nBromocriptine is a dopamine agonist that inhibits prolactin release, thus it does not cause hyperprolactinemia. Haloperidol and Chlorpromazine are both dopamine antagonists that increase prolactin release, leading to hyperprolactinemia. Reserpine depletes monoamines and may lead to a possible increase in prolactin, but its effect is less clear compared to the direct actions of the other drugs. Therefore, the only drug listed that does not cause hyperprolactinemia is Bromocriptine.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"In evaluating the drugs listed, we need to consider their effects on prolactin levels. Bromocriptine is a dopamine agonist that inhibits prolactin release, making it the only drug in this list that does not cause hyperprolactinemia. In contrast, Haloperidol and Chlorpromazine are both dopamine antagonists, which are known to increase prolactin levels and thus can lead to hyperprolactinemia. Reserpine, while it depletes monoamines and may have a less clear effect on prolactin, is generally associated with potential increases in prolactin levels as well. Therefore, the consensus is that Bromocriptine is the only drug listed that does not cause hyperprolactinemia.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
