Ascaris\nopb. Filariasis\nopc. Malaria\nopd. Oncocerciasis\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nIvermectin is an antiparasitic medication with specific indications. It is effective against Oncocerciasis (river blindness) and Filariasis, making it indicated for both conditions. However, it is not effective against Ascaris, a type of roundworm, as the primary treatment for Ascaris is typically albendazole or mebendazole. Importantly, Ivermectin is also not indicated for Malaria, which is caused by Plasmodium species and requires antimalarial drugs. Therefore, the correct answer is that Ivermectin is indicated in all of the following except Malaria.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Ivermectin is an antiparasitic medication that is primarily indicated for certain parasitic infections. It is effective against Oncocerciasis (river blindness) and Filariasis, which are both caused by specific parasites that Ivermectin targets. However, it is not effective against Ascaris, a type of roundworm, for which the standard treatments are albendazole or mebendazole. Additionally, Ivermectin is not indicated for Malaria, which is caused by Plasmodium species and requires different antimalarial medications. Therefore, the options that Ivermectin is indicated for are Oncocerciasis and Filariasis, while it is not indicated for Ascaris and Malaria. Since the question asks for the condition that Ivermectin is not indicated for, the best-supported answer is Malaria. Thus, the correct answer is that Ivermectin is indicated in all of the following except Malaria.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opc\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}",
