Acute renal failure\nopb. Development of antiplatelet antibodies\nopc. Encephalitis secondary to liver dysfunction\nopd. Hemorrhagic stroke\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nFibrinolytic drugs, used in the treatment of acute myocardial infarction, primarily work by dissolving blood clots through the activation of plasminogen to plasmin, leading to increased bleeding risk. The most significant adverse effect associated with their use is hemorrhagic stroke, as these agents can cause systemic fibrinolysis and reduce clot stability, predisposing patients to bleeding complications, particularly in vulnerable areas such as the brain. This is supported by evidence indicating that fibrinolytic agents can lead to hemorrhage, which is a known risk factor for hemorrhagic stroke. Other options, such as acute renal failure, development of antiplatelet antibodies, and encephalitis secondary to liver dysfunction, are not commonly associated with fibrinolytic therapy and do not reflect the primary risks involved.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Fibrinolytic drugs are primarily used to dissolve blood clots in conditions like acute myocardial infarction. The most significant adverse effect associated with these drugs is an increased risk of bleeding, particularly hemorrhagic stroke. This is due to their mechanism of action, which involves the activation of plasminogen to plasmin, leading to systemic fibrinolysis. While acute renal failure, development of antiplatelet antibodies, and encephalitis secondary to liver dysfunction are potential concerns in various medical contexts, they are not commonly associated with the use of fibrinolytic agents. The consensus in the medical literature strongly supports that hemorrhagic stroke is the most likely and serious adverse effect of fibrinolytic therapy. Therefore, the best-supported option is 'hemorrhagic stroke'.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
