Hyperparathyroidism\nopb. Diabetes mellitus\nopc. Kwashiorkor\nopd. Primary aldosteronism\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nHypermagnesemia is characterized by elevated magnesium levels in the blood and can be associated with specific medical conditions. In hyperparathyroidism, increased parathyroid hormone leads to increased renal reabsorption of magnesium, which can contribute to hypermagnesemia. However, this is not a common cause, and hypermagnesemia is more typically associated with conditions like renal failure. In diabetes mellitus, renal impairment can lead to decreased magnesium excretion, potentially resulting in hypermagnesemia, although this is not a direct or common association. Kwashiorkor, a form of protein malnutrition, may lead to electrolyte imbalances, but its direct link to hypermagnesemia is unclear and not well established. In primary aldosteronism, increased aldosterone results in increased renal excretion of magnesium, leading to hypomagnesemia rather than hypermagnesemia. Therefore, the most relevant option for hypermagnesemia is hyperparathyroidism, but it is important to note that this is not a typical presentation. The other options do not support hypermagnesemia effectively.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Hypermagnesemia is typically associated with conditions that lead to renal failure or excessive intake of magnesium. Among the options provided, hyperparathyroidism (opa) is the most relevant, as increased parathyroid hormone can lead to increased renal reabsorption of magnesium, although this is not a common cause of hypermagnesemia. Diabetes mellitus (opb) can lead to renal impairment, which may contribute to hypermagnesemia, but this is not a direct association. Kwashiorkor (opc) is primarily related to protein malnutrition and does not have a well-established link to hypermagnesemia. Primary aldosteronism (opd) typically results in hypomagnesemia due to increased renal excretion of magnesium. Therefore, while hyperparathyroidism is not a classic cause of hypermagnesemia, it is the most plausible option among those listed. The other conditions do not support hypermagnesemia effectively. Thus, the best-supported option is hyperparathyroidism.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}",
