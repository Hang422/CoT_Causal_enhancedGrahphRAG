What action should be taken regarding the treatment of the nurse\n\n                    ### Options\n                    opa. Monitor the nurse's blood to determine whether HIV transmission has occurred or not.\nopb. Treat with full doses of zidovudine for 2weeks.\nopc. Add acyclovir to the 4weeks zidovudine regimen\nopd. Administer zidovudine with lamivudine for 4weeks.\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nIn the case of a needle stick injury from an HIV-positive patient with a CD4 count of 20/microL and a viral load exceeding 10^7 copies/ml, there is a high risk of HIV transmission. The standard recommendation for post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) in such scenarios is to initiate treatment with a combination of antiretroviral medications. The most effective regimen is zidovudine (AZT) combined with lamivudine (3TC) for a duration of 4 weeks. This regimen is supported by clinical guidelines and is considered the standard PEP protocol. Monitoring the nurse's blood alone is inadequate as it delays necessary intervention, and using zidovudine alone for only 2 weeks is insufficient for effective prophylaxis. Therefore, the best course of action is to administer zidovudine with lamivudine for 4 weeks, aligning with established treatment protocols for high-risk exposures.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

The standard post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) protocol for high-risk exposures recommends initiating treatment with a combination of antiretroviral medications. The most effective regimen is a combination of zidovudine (AZT) and lamivudine (3TC) for a duration of 4 weeks. Monitoring the nurse's blood alone is insufficient as it does not provide immediate protection against potential HIV infection. Treating with full doses of zidovudine for only 2 weeks is also inadequate for effective prophylaxis. Therefore, the best-supported option is to administer zidovudine with lamivudine for 4 weeks, as this aligns with established treatment protocols for high-risk exposures. This approach is consistent with clinical guidelines and is the most appropriate action to take in this scenario.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
