INH\nopb. Erythromycin estolate\nopc. Pyrazinamide\nopd. Ethionamide\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nCholestatic jaundice is primarily associated with drugs that cause direct impairment of bile flow. Among the options, 'Erythromycin estolate' is well-documented to cause cholestatic jaundice due to its liver enzyme inhibition leading to impaired bile flow. The reasoning chain for Erythromycin estolate is thus correct and aligns with consensus. In contrast, 'INH' (isoniazid), 'Pyrazinamide', and 'Ethionamide' are more commonly associated with hepatotoxicity and hepatitis rather than direct cholestatic mechanisms. While they can lead to jaundice, it is typically not of the cholestatic type. Therefore, the most accurate answer is 'Erythromycin estolate' as the most frequent cause of cholestatic jaundice.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Cholestatic jaundice is characterized by impaired bile flow, which can be caused by certain medications. Among the options provided, Erythromycin estolate is well-documented in the literature as a drug that can lead to cholestatic jaundice due to its effects on liver enzymes and bile flow. In contrast, INH (isoniazid), Pyrazinamide, and Ethionamide are primarily associated with hepatotoxicity and can cause hepatitis, but they do not typically lead to cholestatic jaundice. Therefore, based on the consensus in pharmacology regarding drug-induced liver injury, Erythromycin estolate is the most likely cause of cholestatic jaundice among the options listed. This reasoning aligns with the enhanced information provided, which supports the conclusion that Erythromycin estolate is the most frequent cause of cholestatic jaundice. Thus, the best-supported option is Erythromycin estolate.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}",
