Strongyloidiasis\nopb. Trichomoniasis\nopc. Schistosomiasis\nopd. Rhinosporidiosis\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nPraziquantel is primarily used for the treatment of schistosomiasis, a disease caused by trematodes (flukes). The reasoning chain for option (opc) is correct: Praziquantel has an antiparasitic action effective against trematodes, making it suitable for schistosomiasis treatment. For option (opb), the chain correctly states that Praziquantel is not effective against protozoa, confirming it is not used for trichomoniasis. Similarly, for option (opd), the chain accurately notes that Praziquantel is not effective against fungi, thus it is not used for rhinosporidiosis. Lastly, for option (opa), the chain correctly indicates that Praziquantel is not effective against nematodes, confirming it is not used for strongyloidiasis. Therefore, the only correct use of Praziquantel among the options provided is for schistosomiasis.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Praziquantel is an antiparasitic medication primarily indicated for the treatment of infections caused by trematodes, particularly schistosomiasis. The other options listed involve different types of parasites: Strongyloidiasis is caused by a nematode, Trichomoniasis is caused by a protozoan, and Rhinosporidiosis is associated with a fungal infection. Praziquantel is not effective against these other types of organisms. Therefore, the consensus in the medical community supports that the correct use of Praziquantel is for schistosomiasis, making option (opc) the best answer.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opc\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
