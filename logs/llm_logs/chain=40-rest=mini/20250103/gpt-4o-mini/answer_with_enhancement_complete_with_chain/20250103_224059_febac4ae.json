Aromatase\nopb. 5 alpha reductase\nopc. Desmolase\nopd. Isomerase\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nAromatase is the enzyme responsible for the conversion of androgens, such as testosterone, to estrogens in the ovarian follicle. This process is crucial for estrogen synthesis during follicular development. In contrast, 5 alpha reductase converts testosterone to dihydrotestosterone, which is not involved in estrogen synthesis. Desmolase is involved in the initial steps of steroidogenesis, converting cholesterol to pregnenolone, but it does not specifically catalyze the conversion to estrogens. Isomerases play a role in steroid metabolism but are not specific to estrogen synthesis either. Therefore, the correct answer is Aromatase, as it directly facilitates the conversion of androgens to estrogens in the ovarian follicle.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The core medical principle here is the enzymatic conversion of androgens to estrogens, which is a critical process in ovarian follicle development. Aromatase is the specific enzyme that catalyzes this conversion, transforming androgens like testosterone into estrogens such as estradiol. The other options do not play a direct role in this conversion: 5 alpha reductase is involved in converting testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT), desmolase is involved in the initial steps of steroidogenesis, and isomerases are not specific to estrogen synthesis. Given this information, the most supported and correct answer is Aromatase. Therefore, the final answer is clear and well-supported by medical consensus.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
