Tamsulosin\nopb. Prazosin\nopc. Oxazocin\nopd. Dolazoline\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nTamsulosin is an alpha-1 adrenergic blocker that specifically targets the smooth muscle in the prostate and bladder neck, leading to relaxation and improved urine flow, providing symptomatic relief in benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Prazosin, another alpha-1 adrenergic blocker, also relaxes smooth muscle and can improve urine flow, but it is less commonly used for BPH compared to Tamsulosin. Oxazocin, while an alpha-1 blocker, is not typically used for BPH and has a lower efficacy in this context. Dolazoline has unclear mechanisms and is not primarily indicated for BPH, leading to uncertain symptomatic relief. Therefore, Tamsulosin is the most effective option for symptomatic relief in BPH, supported by its targeted action on prostate smooth muscle.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The question pertains to the use of alpha-1 adrenergic blockers for symptomatic relief in benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Tamsulosin (option opa) is specifically designed to target the alpha-1 adrenergic receptors in the smooth muscle of the prostate and bladder neck, leading to relaxation and improved urinary flow. This makes it the most effective and commonly prescribed medication for BPH. Prazosin (option opb) is also an alpha-1 blocker and can provide some relief, but it is not as commonly used for BPH as Tamsulosin. Oxazocin (option opc) and Dolazoline (option opd) are less relevant in this context, with Oxazocin not being a standard treatment for BPH and Dolazoline lacking a clear indication for this condition. Therefore, based on the consensus in pharmacology regarding the treatment of BPH, Tamsulosin is the best-supported option for symptomatic relief.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
