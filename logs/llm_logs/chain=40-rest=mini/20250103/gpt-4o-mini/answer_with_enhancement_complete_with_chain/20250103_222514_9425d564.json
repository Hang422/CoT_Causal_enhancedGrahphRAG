Renin\nopb. Angiotensin I\nopc. Erythropoietin\nopd. 1,25DHCC\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nRenin is produced by juxtaglomerular cells in the kidneys, confirming it is part of the renal system. Angiotensin I is not produced directly by the renal system; it is formed in the bloodstream from angiotensinogen by the action of renin, which is produced in the kidneys. Erythropoietin is produced by interstitial fibroblasts in the kidneys, making it part of the renal system. 1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25DHCC) is the active form of vitamin D, which is converted in the kidneys, thus it is also produced by the renal system. Therefore, the only peptide not produced by the renal system is Angiotensin I.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "
