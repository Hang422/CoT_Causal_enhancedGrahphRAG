Loxatidine\nopb. Pirenzepine\nopc. Omeprazole\nopd. Famotidine\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nOmeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor that effectively blocks both basal and stimulated gastric acid secretion by inhibiting the H+/K+ ATPase in the gastric parietal cells. Importantly, it does this without affecting cholinergic, histaminergic, or gastrin receptors, aligning with the requirement of the question. In contrast, Loxatidine and Famotidine are H2 receptor antagonists, which specifically block histamine-induced gastric acid secretion and thus affect histaminergic receptors. Pirenzepine is an anticholinergic agent that blocks cholinergic receptors, which also disqualifies it from the criteria. Therefore, the only option that meets all criteria is Omeprazole.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The question asks for a drug that blocks both basal and stimulated gastric acid secretion without affecting cholinergic, histaminergic, or gastrin receptors. Omeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor that works by inhibiting the H+/K+ ATPase in gastric parietal cells, effectively reducing gastric acid secretion regardless of the stimulus. It does not interact with cholinergic, histaminergic, or gastrin receptors, making it the only option that meets all the specified criteria. In contrast, Loxatidine and Famotidine are H2 receptor antagonists that block histamine-induced acid secretion, thus affecting histaminergic receptors. Pirenzepine is an anticholinergic that blocks cholinergic receptors, which also disqualifies it. Therefore, Omeprazole is the best-supported option based on the provided information and established pharmacological principles.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opc\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
