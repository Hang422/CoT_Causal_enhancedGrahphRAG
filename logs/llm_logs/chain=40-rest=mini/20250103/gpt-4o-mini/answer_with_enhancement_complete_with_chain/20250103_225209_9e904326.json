Dexamethasone\nopb. Betamethasone\nopc. Hydrocoisone\nopd. Prednisolone\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nIn cases of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), particularly due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency, there is a risk of virilization in female fetuses due to excess androgen production. The drug of choice for managing this condition in pregnant females is Dexamethasone, as it effectively crosses the placenta and suppresses fetal adrenal androgen production, thereby reducing the risk of virilization. The reasoning chains confirm that Dexamethasone is effective in this context, with a consensus supporting its use for fetal treatment in CAH. Other options like Betamethasone, Hydrocortisone, and Prednisolone are not typically used for this specific indication. The evidence paths regarding Dexamethasone's role in treating virilism further support its use in this scenario.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"In cases of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), particularly when caused by 21-hydroxylase deficiency, there is a significant risk of virilization in female fetuses due to excess androgen production. The primary goal in managing this condition during pregnancy is to suppress the fetal adrenal gland's production of androgens. Dexamethasone is the drug of choice in this scenario because it effectively crosses the placenta and reduces the production of androgens by the fetal adrenal glands. Other corticosteroids such as Betamethasone, Hydrocortisone, and Prednisolone are not typically indicated for this specific purpose. The consensus in the medical community supports the use of Dexamethasone for this indication, making it the most appropriate choice. Therefore, the best-supported option is Dexamethasone (option opa).\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
