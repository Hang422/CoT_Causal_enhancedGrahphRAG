Liver\nopb. Adipose tissue\nopc. RBC\nopd. Brain\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nThe HMP shunt, also known as the pentose phosphate pathway, is crucial for generating NADPH and ribose-5-phosphate. It occurs in various tissues, including the liver, adipose tissue, and brain, where NADPH is essential for biosynthetic reactions. However, while red blood cells (RBCs) do utilize the HMP shunt for NADPH production, they lack mitochondria and primarily rely on glycolysis for energy. Therefore, the consensus indicates that the HMP shunt is not significantly active in RBCs compared to other tissues. Thus, the correct answer is that the HMP shunt occurs in all organs except RBCs.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "
