Salbutamol\nopb. Ketotifen\nopc. Fluticasone\nopd. Monteleukast\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nSalbutamol is a beta adrenergic agonist that is commonly used in aerosol form for the treatment of bronchial asthma, providing effective bronchodilation. Ketotifen is an antihistamine and not a beta adrenergic agonist, making it unsuitable for this purpose. Fluticasone is a corticosteroid used in asthma management but does not act as a beta adrenergic agonist. Monteleukast is a leukotriene receptor antagonist, administered orally, and is also not a beta adrenergic agonist. Therefore, the only correct option for aerosol treatment of bronchial asthma is Salbutamol.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"In the context of treating bronchial asthma, beta adrenergic agonists are commonly used for their bronchodilatory effects. Salbutamol is a well-established beta adrenergic agonist that is frequently administered via aerosol inhalation to provide rapid relief from bronchospasm associated with asthma. The other options listed do not fit the criteria: Ketotifen is an antihistamine, Fluticasone is a corticosteroid, and Montelukast is a leukotriene receptor antagonist. None of these options serve as beta adrenergic agonists or are used in aerosol form for asthma treatment. Therefore, Salbutamol is the only correct answer based on established medical knowledge and consensus.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
