Propanolol\nopb. Oral contraceptives\nopc. Reserpine\nopd. Flupenthixol\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nPropranolol, a beta-blocker, has been associated with possible depression due to its central nervous system effects, but this is not universally accepted as a common side effect. Oral contraceptives can lead to mood alterations due to hormonal changes, which may include depression, but this varies among individuals. Reserpine is well-documented to cause depression due to its mechanism of depleting monoamines, particularly serotonin. Flupenthixol, an antipsychotic, is primarily a dopamine receptor antagonist and is generally not associated with depression; in fact, it may improve mood in some patients. Therefore, the option least associated with depression is Flupenthixol.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"To determine which option is least associated with depression, we analyze each medication: Propranolol (opa) has been linked to depression in some cases, though this is not universally accepted. Oral contraceptives (opb) can cause mood changes, including depression, due to hormonal fluctuations, but this varies widely among individuals. Reserpine (opc) is well-known for causing depression due to its action on monoamines, particularly serotonin depletion. Flupenthixol (opd), while an antipsychotic, is not typically associated with depression and may even have mood-improving effects in some patients. Given this analysis, Flupenthixol is the option least associated with depression.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
