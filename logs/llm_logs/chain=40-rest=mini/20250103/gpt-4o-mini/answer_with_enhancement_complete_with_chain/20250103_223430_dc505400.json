Imipramine\nopb. Fluvoxamine\nopc. Phenelzine\nopd. Bupropion\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nImipramine is a tricyclic antidepressant known for its anticholinergic effects, which can reduce bladder contractions and subsequently decrease nocturnal enuresis. This aligns with clinical consensus that supports the use of imipramine in treating bedwetting. In contrast, fluvoxamine (an SSRI), phenelzine (an MAOI), and bupropion (an NDRI) do not have direct effects on bladder function and are unlikely to be effective for nocturnal enuresis. Therefore, imipramine is the most appropriate choice for this condition.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "
