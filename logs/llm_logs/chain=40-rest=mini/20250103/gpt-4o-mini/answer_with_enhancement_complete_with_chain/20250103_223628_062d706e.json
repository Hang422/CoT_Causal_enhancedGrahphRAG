Hyoscine\nopb. Metoclopramide\nopc. Prochlorperazine\nopd. Ondansetron\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nHyoscine (also known as scopolamine) is an anticholinergic agent that effectively inhibits the vestibular system, making it useful in the prophylaxis of motion sickness, with a high efficacy rating of 95%. In contrast, Metoclopramide and Prochlorperazine are dopamine antagonists that primarily act on the chemoreceptor trigger zone to reduce nausea but are not specifically indicated for motion sickness, reflected in their lower efficacy rating of 60%. Ondansetron, a serotonin antagonist, also acts on the chemoreceptor trigger zone and is not specific for motion sickness, similarly rated at 60%. Therefore, Hyoscine is the most appropriate choice for preventing motion sickness.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The core medical principle in the prophylaxis of motion sickness is the use of medications that target the vestibular system or the pathways involved in motion perception. Hyoscine (scopolamine) is an anticholinergic agent that effectively inhibits the vestibular system, making it the most appropriate choice for preventing motion sickness. The enhanced information supports this by indicating a high efficacy rating of 95% for Hyoscine in this context. In contrast, Metoclopramide and Prochlorperazine, while effective for nausea, primarily act on the chemoreceptor trigger zone and are not specifically indicated for motion sickness, with lower efficacy ratings. Ondansetron, a serotonin antagonist, also does not specifically target motion sickness and shares a similar efficacy rating. Therefore, based on the consensus and the enhanced information provided, Hyoscine is the best-supported option for the prophylaxis of motion sickness.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
