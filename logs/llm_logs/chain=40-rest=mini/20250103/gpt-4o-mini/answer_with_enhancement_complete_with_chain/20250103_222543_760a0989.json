Aldosterone\nopb. DOCA\nopc. Fludrocoeisone\nopd. Triamcinolone\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nAldosterone is the most potent mineralocorticoid, primarily responsible for sodium retention and increasing blood volume, which aligns with its strong mineralocorticoid effect. DOCA (Desoxycorticosterone acetate) has moderate sodium retention but is less potent than aldosterone. Fludrocortisone is also a potent mineralocorticoid, but its potency is generally considered less than that of aldosterone. Triamcinolone, on the other hand, has minimal mineralocorticoid activity and is not considered a potent mineralocorticoid. Therefore, the consensus supports that aldosterone is the most potent mineralocorticoid.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The question asks for the most potent mineralocorticoid. Aldosterone is widely recognized as the primary mineralocorticoid hormone produced by the adrenal cortex, with a strong effect on sodium retention and blood volume regulation. While DOCA and fludrocortisone also exhibit mineralocorticoid activity, they are generally considered less potent than aldosterone. Triamcinolone, primarily a glucocorticoid, has minimal mineralocorticoid activity and does not qualify as a potent mineralocorticoid. Therefore, based on established pharmacological knowledge and consensus, aldosterone is the most potent mineralocorticoid. The reasoning aligns with the enhanced information provided, confirming that aldosterone is indeed the correct answer.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
