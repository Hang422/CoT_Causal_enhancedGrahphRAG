Propanolol\nopb. Aiprazolam\nopc. Buspirone\nopd. Haloperidol\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nPropranolol is a beta-blocker primarily used for cardiovascular issues, but it can be used off-label for performance anxiety, making its role in anxiety treatment somewhat nuanced. Alprazolam is a benzodiazepine widely recognized for its efficacy in treating anxiety disorders. Buspirone is an anxiolytic specifically indicated for anxiety treatment. Haloperidol, an antipsychotic, is not typically used for anxiety and is primarily indicated for schizophrenia and acute psychosis. Therefore, the drug not used for anxiety is Haloperidol.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"In evaluating the options provided, we consider the primary uses of each medication. Propranolol (option opa) is a beta-blocker that can be used off-label for performance anxiety, although it is not a first-line treatment for generalized anxiety disorders. Alprazolam (option opb) is a benzodiazepine that is widely used for anxiety disorders, making it a clear choice for anxiety treatment. Buspirone (option opc) is specifically indicated for anxiety and is used as an anxiolytic. Haloperidol (option opd), on the other hand, is an antipsychotic medication primarily used for treating schizophrenia and acute psychosis, and it is not indicated for anxiety treatment. Therefore, the drug that is not used for anxiety is Haloperidol. This conclusion aligns with standard medical knowledge and consensus regarding the indications for these medications.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
