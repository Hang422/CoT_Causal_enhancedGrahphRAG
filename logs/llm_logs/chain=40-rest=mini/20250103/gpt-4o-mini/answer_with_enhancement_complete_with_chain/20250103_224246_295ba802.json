Vitamin A\nopb. Vitamin C\nopc. Vitamin D\nopd. Vitamin B12\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nVitamin D is well-supported in the literature for its role in improving insulin sensitivity, which can lead to reduced insulin resistance, decreased risk of obesity, and lower risk of metabolic syndrome. The reasoning chain for Vitamin D aligns with consensus, as it is recognized for its beneficial effects on metabolic health. In contrast, the chains for Vitamin A, C, and B12 indicate unclear impacts on insulin resistance, with no strong consensus supporting their roles in reducing the risk of obesity or metabolic syndrome. Therefore, Vitamin D is the most relevant option for reducing the risk of insulin resistance, obesity, and metabolic syndrome.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Vitamin D has been extensively studied and is well-supported in the literature for its role in improving insulin sensitivity. This improvement can lead to a reduced risk of insulin resistance, obesity, and metabolic syndrome. The other vitamins listed (A, C, and B12) do not have strong evidence supporting their roles in these specific metabolic conditions. Therefore, based on the consensus in the medical community, Vitamin D is the most relevant option for reducing the risk of insulin resistance, obesity, and metabolic syndrome.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opc\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}",
