Cough suppression\nopb. Anti-emesis\nopc. Miosis\nopd. Truncal rigidity\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nOpioids are known for several pharmacological actions. Cough suppression is a recognized effect of opioids, as they can act on the cough center in the brain. Miosis, or pupil constriction, is a classic effect of opioid use due to their action on the central nervous system. Truncal rigidity, characterized by muscle stiffness, can occur with high doses of opioids, particularly during anesthesia. However, anti-emesis is not a common action of opioids; while some opioids can cause nausea, they are not typically used to prevent vomiting. Therefore, the option that is NOT a pharmacological action of opioids is anti-emesis.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "
