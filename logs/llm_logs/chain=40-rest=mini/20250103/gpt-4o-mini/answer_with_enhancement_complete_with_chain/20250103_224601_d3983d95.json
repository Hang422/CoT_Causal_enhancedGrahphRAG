Chylomicrons\nopb. VLDL\nopc. HDL\nopd. LDL\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nLipids, specifically dietary fats, are absorbed in the intestine and packaged into chylomicrons. These chylomicrons are then transported through the lymphatic system and enter the bloodstream, ultimately delivering lipids to the liver. This process is well-supported by consensus in physiology, confirming that chylomicrons are the primary carriers of dietary lipids from the intestine to the liver. Other lipoproteins like VLDL, HDL, and LDL are involved in lipid transport but are not responsible for the initial transfer of dietary lipids from the intestine. Therefore, the correct answer is chylomicrons.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "
