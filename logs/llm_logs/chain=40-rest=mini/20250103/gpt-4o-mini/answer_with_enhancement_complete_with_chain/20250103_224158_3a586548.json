Mouth\nopb. Stomach\nopc. Small intestine\nopd. Large intestine\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nDisaccharides, such as sucrose and lactose, undergo significant digestion primarily in the small intestine. Enzymes like sucrase and lactase are secreted in the intestinal lining, breaking down disaccharides into monosaccharides, which are then absorbed into the bloodstream. While disaccharides enter the mouth and stomach, there is no significant digestion occurring in these areas due to the lack of specific enzymes. The large intestine may see some fermentation of undigested disaccharides by gut bacteria, but this is not the primary site for their digestion. Therefore, the correct answer is that digestion of disaccharides occurs at the small intestine.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "
