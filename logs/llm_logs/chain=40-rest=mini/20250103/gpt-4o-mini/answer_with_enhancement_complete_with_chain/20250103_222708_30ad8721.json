Imiquimod\nopb. Podophylline\nopc. Interferon\nopd. Acyclovir\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nImiquimod is a topical immunomodulator that activates the immune response and is well-established for the treatment of genital warts, aligning with a consensus of its efficacy in this indication. Podophylline, while also a topical treatment, works through a cytotoxic mechanism rather than immunomodulation, making it less aligned with the question's focus on immunomodulators. Interferon can modulate the immune response but is not commonly used for genital warts, thus its relevance is lower. Acyclovir is an antiviral medication specifically for herpes simplex virus and is not used for genital warts. Therefore, the best answer is Imiquimod, supported by its established role in treating genital warts.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The question asks for a topical immunomodulator used for the treatment of genital warts. Among the options provided, Imiquimod is recognized as a topical immunomodulator that enhances the immune response against the human papillomavirus (HPV), which is responsible for genital warts. Podophylline, while effective for genital warts, acts through a cytotoxic mechanism rather than immunomodulation. Interferon can modulate the immune response but is not typically used topically for genital warts. Acyclovir is an antiviral medication and is not indicated for genital warts. Therefore, based on established medical knowledge and consensus, Imiquimod is the most appropriate choice for this indication.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
