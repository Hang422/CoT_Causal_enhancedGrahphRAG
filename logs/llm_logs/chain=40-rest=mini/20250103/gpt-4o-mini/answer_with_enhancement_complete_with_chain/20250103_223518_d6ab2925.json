Methimazole\nopb. Propylthiouraril\nopc. Carbimazole\nopd. Perchlorate\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nIn the management of hyperthyroidism during the first trimester of pregnancy, Propylthiouracil (PTU) is the preferred choice due to its lower placental transfer and reduced risk of fetal abnormalities compared to Methimazole and Carbimazole, which are associated with higher risks due to their ability to cross the placenta. Methimazole and Carbimazole are metabolized to methimazole, thus sharing similar risks, making them not preferred in early pregnancy. Perchlorate is less commonly used and poses potential risks to fetal development, further supporting the preference for PTU. Therefore, the consensus strongly favors Propylthiouracil as the safest option for treating hyperthyroidism in the first trimester.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

This is due to its lower placental transfer compared to Methimazole and Carbimazole, which are associated with a higher risk of fetal abnormalities. Methimazole and Carbimazole are both contraindicated in early pregnancy because they can cross the placenta and have been linked to teratogenic effects. Perchlorate is not commonly used and carries potential risks to fetal development as well. Therefore, the consensus in the medical community strongly supports the use of Propylthiouracil as the safest option for treating hyperthyroidism in the first trimester. This aligns with the enhanced information provided, which emphasizes the importance of minimizing risks to the developing fetus during this critical period.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
