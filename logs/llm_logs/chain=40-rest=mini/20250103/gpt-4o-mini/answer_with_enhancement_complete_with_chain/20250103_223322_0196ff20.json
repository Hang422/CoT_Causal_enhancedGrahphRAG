Ototoxicity\nopb. Nephrotoxicity\nopc. Coasting effect\nopd. Pulmonary fibrosis\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nCisplatin is known to cause ototoxicity, which can lead to hearing loss, and nephrotoxicity, resulting in kidney damage. The coasting effect, characterized by delayed neuropathy, is not a recognized side effect of Cisplatin. Pulmonary fibrosis has an unclear association with Cisplatin, but it is not a well-established side effect. Therefore, the correct answer is that Cisplatin does not produce the coasting effect.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Cisplatin is a chemotherapeutic agent known for its side effects, particularly ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity. Ototoxicity can lead to hearing loss, while nephrotoxicity can cause kidney damage, both of which are well-documented. The term 'coasting effect' is not associated with Cisplatin; it is more relevant to other agents, particularly in the context of delayed neuropathy. Pulmonary fibrosis is not a common or well-established side effect of Cisplatin, although some reports suggest a potential link. Given this information, the most accurate answer is that Cisplatin does not produce the coasting effect, as it is not recognized as a side effect of this drug. Therefore, the correct option is 'coasting effect'.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opc\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}",
