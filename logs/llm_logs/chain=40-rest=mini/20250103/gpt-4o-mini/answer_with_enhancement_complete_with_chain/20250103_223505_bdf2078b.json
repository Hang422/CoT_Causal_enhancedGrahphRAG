Protein C deficiency\nopb. Protein S deficiency\nopc. Hemophillia\nopd. Antithrombin III deficiency\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nWarfarin-induced skin necrosis is primarily associated with deficiencies in Protein C and Protein S. Warfarin works by inhibiting vitamin K-dependent clotting factors, which leads to a rapid decrease in Protein C and S levels, resulting in a transient hypercoagulable state that can cause skin necrosis. The reasoning chain for Protein C deficiency is strong, as it directly links to the mechanism of warfarin and the resultant skin necrosis. The chain for Protein S deficiency is also valid but less definitive, as the risk is lower compared to Protein C deficiency. Hemophilia does not cause skin necrosis related to warfarin, as it does not affect the coagulation pathway targeted by warfarin. Antithrombin III deficiency is similarly not directly linked to warfarin-induced skin necrosis, as warfarin does not significantly affect antithrombin levels. Therefore, the most relevant options are Protein C and Protein S deficiencies, with Protein C deficiency being the most strongly associated with warfarin-induced skin necrosis.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Warfarin-induced skin necrosis is primarily associated with deficiencies in Protein C and Protein S. The mechanism involves the rapid decrease in these proteins due to warfarin's action on vitamin K-dependent clotting factors, leading to a transient hypercoagulable state. Among the options provided, Protein C deficiency (opa) is the most strongly linked to this condition, as it directly results in a higher risk of skin necrosis when warfarin is initiated. Protein S deficiency (opb) is also relevant but is less commonly associated with this specific complication. Hemophilia (opc) and Antithrombin III deficiency (opd) do not have a direct connection to warfarin-induced skin necrosis. Therefore, the best-supported option is Protein C deficiency.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}",
