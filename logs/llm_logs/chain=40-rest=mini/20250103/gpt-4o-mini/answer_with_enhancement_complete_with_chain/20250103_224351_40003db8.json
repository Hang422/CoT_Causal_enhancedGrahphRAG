Heparin sulfate\nopb. Protamine sulfate\nopc. Low molecular weight heparin\nopd. Warfarin\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nIn patients undergoing cancer surgery, there is an increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE), necessitating effective prophylaxis. Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) is the anticoagulant of choice for VTE prophylaxis in this context due to its efficacy and convenience, with studies showing it to be effective in reducing the incidence of VTE in surgical patients. Heparin sulfate is also effective but is less convenient than LMWH, making it a less favorable option. Warfarin is not ideal for immediate prophylaxis as it requires monitoring and takes time to achieve therapeutic levels. Protamine sulfate is not an anticoagulant; it is used to reverse the effects of heparin and is not relevant for prophylaxis. Therefore, the best choice for prophylaxis in this scenario is LMWH.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"In patients undergoing cancer surgery, the risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) is significantly increased. The standard medical consensus supports the use of low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) for VTE prophylaxis in this population due to its proven efficacy, ease of use, and favorable pharmacokinetic profile. Heparin sulfate, while effective, is less convenient than LMWH. Warfarin is not suitable for immediate prophylaxis due to its delayed onset and need for monitoring. Protamine sulfate is not an anticoagulant and is used to reverse heparin effects, making it irrelevant in this context. Therefore, the best-supported option for prophylaxis in patients undergoing cancer surgery is LMWH.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opc\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
