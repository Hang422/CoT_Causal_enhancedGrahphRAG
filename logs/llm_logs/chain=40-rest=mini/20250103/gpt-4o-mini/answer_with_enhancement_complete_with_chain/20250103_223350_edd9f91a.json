Osteoporosis\nopb. Endometrial hyperplasia\nopc. Ovarian cancer\nopd. Decreased triglyceride level\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nTamoxifen is a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) primarily used in the treatment of estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer. It is known to cause endometrial hyperplasia due to its estrogenic effects on the endometrium, which aligns with the first option (opb). While Tamoxifen can have protective effects on bone density, it does not directly cause osteoporosis; rather, it may help prevent it in postmenopausal women (opA is misleading). The claim regarding decreased triglyceride levels (opd) lacks strong consensus support, as Tamoxifen's effects on lipid profiles are not well-established. Lastly, while there is some concern about ovarian stimulation and potential ovarian cancer risk (opc), the evidence is less definitive and does not establish a clear causal relationship. Therefore, the most accurate and consensus-supported outcome is that Tamoxifen causes endometrial hyperplasia.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "
