Selenium\nopb. Phosphorus\nopc. Boron\nopd. Zinc\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nCardiomyopathy can be associated with various nutritional deficiencies, but the most relevant consensus points to selenium deficiency as a significant factor. Selenium plays a crucial role in antioxidant defense, and its deficiency has been linked to increased oxidative stress, which can lead to cardiomyopathy. The reasoning chain for selenium is thus supported: 'Selenium deficiency' -> 'oxidative stress' -> 'cardiomyopathy'. In contrast, phosphorus and boron deficiencies have unclear or weak links to cardiomyopathy, and while zinc deficiency may have indirect effects on cardiac health through immune dysfunction, it is not a direct cause of cardiomyopathy. Therefore, the most consensus-aligned option is selenium deficiency as a notable contributor to cardiomyopathy.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Cardiomyopathy can arise from various nutritional deficiencies, but selenium deficiency is the most well-documented and recognized cause. Selenium is essential for the proper functioning of antioxidant enzymes, and its deficiency can lead to increased oxidative stress, which is a known contributor to the development of cardiomyopathy. While zinc deficiency can affect cardiac health, it is not directly linked to cardiomyopathy in the same way that selenium deficiency is. Phosphorus and boron do not have strong associations with cardiomyopathy. Therefore, based on the consensus in the medical literature, selenium deficiency is the most relevant option.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}",
