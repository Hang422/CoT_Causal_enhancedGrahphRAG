Ethanolamine oleate\nopb. Octreotide\nopc. Propanolol\nopd. Phytonadione\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nThe drug of choice for bleeding oesophageal varices is Octreotide. It works by inducing vasoconstriction of the splanchnic circulation, which leads to reduced portal pressure and effectively controls bleeding from varices. Propranolol is used primarily for the prevention of variceal bleeding due to its beta-blocking effects that reduce portal hypertension, but it is not the first-line treatment during active bleeding. Ethanolamine oleate is used in sclerotherapy to obliterate varices, but it is not the primary choice for acute management. Phytonadione (Vitamin K) is important for coagulation but does not directly address the acute bleeding from varices. Therefore, Octreotide is the most appropriate choice based on its mechanism and effectiveness in managing acute variceal hemorrhage.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The management of bleeding oesophageal varices primarily focuses on controlling the acute hemorrhage and reducing portal pressure. Octreotide is a somatostatin analogue that effectively induces vasoconstriction in the splanchnic circulation, thereby reducing blood flow to the varices and controlling bleeding. This makes it the drug of choice in acute settings. Propranolol, while effective for preventing variceal bleeding due to its ability to lower portal hypertension, is not indicated for acute management. Ethanolamine oleate is used in sclerotherapy but is not the first-line treatment for active bleeding. Phytonadione (Vitamin K) is important for coagulation but does not directly address the bleeding from varices. Therefore, based on the mechanism of action and clinical effectiveness, Octreotide is the most appropriate choice for the acute management of bleeding oesophageal varices.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
