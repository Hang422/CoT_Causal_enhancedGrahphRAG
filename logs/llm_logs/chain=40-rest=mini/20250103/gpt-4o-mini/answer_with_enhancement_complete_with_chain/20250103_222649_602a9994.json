Atrial flutter\nopb. Parkinsonian tremor\nopc. Thyrotoxicosis\nopd. HOCM\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nPropranolol is a non-selective beta-blocker that is effective in various conditions. For atrial flutter, it is useful as it decreases heart rate and controls the rhythm, aligning with consensus (90% confidence). In the case of Parkinsonian tremor, propranolol may reduce tremors, but its effectiveness is not well-established and is generally considered less effective than other treatments, leading to a lower confidence (60%). Propranolol is also effective in managing symptoms of thyrotoxicosis by reducing sympathetic activity, which is well-supported (95% confidence). However, in hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM), propranolol can worsen outflow obstruction due to its heart rate-lowering effects, which is a known concern (85% confidence). Therefore, the option where propranolol is not useful is HOCM.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "
