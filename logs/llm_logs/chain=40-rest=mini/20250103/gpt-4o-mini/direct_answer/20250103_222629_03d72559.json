  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Digoxin has significant interactions with cholestyramine, thiazide diuretics, and quinidine. Cholestyramine can reduce the absorption of digoxin, thiazide diuretics can cause electrolyte imbalances that may affect digoxin levels, and quinidine can increase digoxin levels by displacing it from tissue binding sites. Amlodipine, a calcium channel blocker, does not have significant interactions with digoxin.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opd\",\n    \"confidence\": 90\n}",
