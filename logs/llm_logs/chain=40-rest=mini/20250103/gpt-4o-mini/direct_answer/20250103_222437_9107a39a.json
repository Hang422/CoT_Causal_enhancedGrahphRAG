  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"In patients with cancer-related dyspnoea, opioids such as morphine are commonly used for palliation due to their ability to reduce the sensation of breathlessness and improve comfort. Diazepam and clobazam are anxiolytics that may help with anxiety-related dyspnoea but are not first-line treatments. Haloperidol is an antipsychotic that may be used for nausea or agitation but is not indicated for dyspnoea management. Therefore, the most appropriate choice for palliation of dyspnoea in this context is a morphine patch.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opa\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}",
