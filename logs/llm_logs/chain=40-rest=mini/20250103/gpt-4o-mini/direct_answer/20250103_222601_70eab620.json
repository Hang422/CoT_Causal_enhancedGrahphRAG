A significant risk associated with their use is bleeding complications, particularly hemorrhagic stroke, due to the disruption of normal hemostasis. Other options listed, such as acute renal failure, development of antiplatelet antibodies, and encephalitis secondary to liver dysfunction, are not commonly associated with fibrinolytic therapy.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opd\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}",
