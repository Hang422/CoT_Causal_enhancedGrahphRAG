  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Folic acid metabolism is inhibited by Methotrexate (which inhibits dihydrofolate reductase) and Trimethoprim (which also inhibits bacterial dihydrofolate reductase). Sulfonamides inhibit folate synthesis but do not directly inhibit folic acid metabolism. Nitrous oxide can inactivate vitamin B12, which is involved in folate metabolism, but it is not a direct inhibitor of folic acid metabolism. 5-Flucytosine does not have a direct effect on folic acid metabolism. Therefore, the correct options that inhibit folic acid metabolism are Methotrexate and Trimethoprim, which corresponds to option 'abd'.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opb\",\n    \"confidence\": 90\n}",
