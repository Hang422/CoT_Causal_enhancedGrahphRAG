      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Which of the following is not an action of epinephrine when administered intravenously in a high dose?\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Increases liver glycogenolysis\nopb. Causes broachiolar constriction\nopc. Evokes extrasystoles in the heart\nopd. Produces restlessness and anxiety\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Epinephrine\" -> \"increased liver glycogenolysis\" -> \"increased blood glucose\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Epinephrine\" -> \"bronchiolar constriction\" -> \"possible conflict with bronchodilation\" -> 60%\nCHAIN: \"Epinephrine\" -> \"evokes extrasystoles in the heart\" -> \"increased heart rate\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Epinephrine\" -> \"produces restlessness and anxiety\" -> \"increased sympathetic activity\" -> 85%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Epinephrine)-CAUSES->(Disease)-CAUSES->(Agitation)\n(Epinephrine)-CAUSES->(Hypertensive disease)-CAUSES->(Agitation)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Epinephrine, when administered intravenously in high doses, has several well-documented actions. It increases liver glycogenolysis, leading to elevated blood glucose levels, which is consistent with its role as a sympathomimetic agent. However, it causes bronchodilation, not bronchiolar constriction, which contradicts the option suggesting otherwise. Epinephrine can evoke extrasystoles due to its stimulatory effects on the heart, increasing heart rate and contractility. Additionally, it can produce restlessness and anxiety as a result of heightened sympathetic activity. Therefore, the option that is not an action of epinephrine is 'Causes bronchiolar constriction.'\"\n}",
