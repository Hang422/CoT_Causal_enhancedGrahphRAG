      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        In herpes simplex encephalitis, drugs used are, EXCEPT:\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Acyclovir\nopb. Vidarabine\nopc. Ganciclovir\nopd. Amantadine\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Herpes simplex encephalitis\" -> \"caused by herpes simplex virus\" -> \"requires antiviral treatment\" -> \"Acyclovir is standard treatment\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Herpes simplex encephalitis\" -> \"caused by herpes simplex virus\" -> \"requires antiviral treatment\" -> \"Vidarabine is an older treatment option\" -> 80%\nCHAIN: \"Herpes simplex encephalitis\" -> \"caused by herpes simplex virus\" -> \"requires antiviral treatment\" -> \"Ganciclovir is used for CMV, not typically for herpes simplex\" -> 70%\nCHAIN: \"Herpes simplex encephalitis\" -> \"caused by herpes simplex virus\" -> \"requires antiviral treatment\" -> \"Amantadine is not an antiviral for herpes simplex\" -> 95%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Herpes encephalitis)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Simplexvirus)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Herpes simplex encephalitis is primarily caused by the herpes simplex virus (HSV) and requires antiviral treatment. Acyclovir is the standard treatment for this condition, supported by strong clinical evidence. Vidarabine, while an older treatment option, is less commonly used today but can still be considered in some cases. Ganciclovir is primarily used for cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections and is not typically indicated for herpes simplex virus infections. Amantadine is an antiviral drug, but it is not effective against herpes simplex virus and is not used for herpes simplex encephalitis. Therefore, the drug that is not used in the treatment of herpes simplex encephalitis is Amantadine.\"\n}",
