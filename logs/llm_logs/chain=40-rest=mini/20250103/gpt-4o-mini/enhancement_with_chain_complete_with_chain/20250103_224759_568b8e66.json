      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Gastric irritation is least with following NSA1D: (PGI June 2008)\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Diclofenac\nopb. Acetaminophen\nopc. Ibuprofen\nopd. Naproxen\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Acetaminophen\" -> \"minimal COX inhibition in stomach\" -> \"least gastric irritation\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Diclofenac\" -> \"moderate COX inhibition\" -> \"some gastric irritation\" -> 60%\nCHAIN: \"Ibuprofen\" -> \"COX inhibition\" -> \"gastric irritation\" -> 50%\nCHAIN: \"Naproxen\" -> \"strong COX inhibition\" -> \"more gastric irritation\" -> 40%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Ibuprofen)-TREATS->(Obstruction)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Prostaglandin-Endoperoxide Synthase)\n(Diclofenac)-TREATS->(Complication)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Prostaglandin-Endoperoxide Synthase)\n(Diclofenac)-TREATS->(Inflammation)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Prostaglandin-Endoperoxide Synthase)\n(Ibuprofen)-TREATS->(Hypoxia)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Prostaglandin-Endoperoxide Synthase)\n(Naproxen)-TREATS->(Inflammation)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Prostaglandin-Endoperoxide Synthase)\n(Naproxen)-ISA->(Analgesics)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Prostaglandin-Endoperoxide Synthase)\n(Acetaminophen)-TREATS->(Disease)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Respiration)-PROCESS_OF->(Stomach)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Acetaminophen is known for its minimal COX inhibition in the stomach, leading to the least gastric irritation among the options. In contrast, Diclofenac, Ibuprofen, and Naproxen exhibit varying degrees of COX inhibition, which correlates with increased gastric irritation. Specifically, Diclofenac has moderate COX inhibition, Ibuprofen has significant COX inhibition, and Naproxen has strong COX inhibition, resulting in more gastric irritation. The evidence paths related to the treatment of inflammation and the role of Prostaglandin-Endoperoxide Synthase support the understanding that COX inhibition is linked to gastric irritation. Therefore, Acetaminophen is the correct choice for least gastric irritation.\"\n}",
