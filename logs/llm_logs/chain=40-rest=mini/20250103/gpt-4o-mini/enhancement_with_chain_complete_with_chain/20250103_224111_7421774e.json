      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Following a myocardial infarct, a 40-year-old man is being treated prophylactically with propranolol. You would be concerned about the use of this drug if the patient also had what comorbid condition\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Glaucoma\nopb. Essential tremor\nopc. Diabetes\nopd. Supraventricular tachycardia\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Propranolol\" -> \"beta-blocker\" -> \"decreased heart rate\" -> \"decreased hypoglycemia awareness\" -> \"Diabetes\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Propranolol\" -> \"beta-blocker\" -> \"bronchoconstriction\" -> \"possible asthma exacerbation\" -> \"unclear\" -> 60%\nCHAIN: \"Propranolol\" -> \"beta-blocker\" -> \"decreased heart rate\" -> \"decreased cardiac output\" -> \"Supraventricular tachycardia\" -> 70%\nCHAIN: \"Propranolol\" -> \"beta-blocker\" -> \"decreased intraocular pressure\" -> \"Glaucoma\" -> 50%\nCHAIN: \"Propranolol\" -> \"beta-blocker\" -> \"decreased tremor amplitude\" -> \"Essential tremor\" -> 40%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Propranolol)-INTERACTS_WITH/ISA->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Adrenergic beta-Antagonists)-Antagonists)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Propranolol is a non-selective beta-blocker that can have significant effects on various comorbid conditions. In patients with diabetes, propranolol can mask hypoglycemia symptoms, which is a critical concern for diabetic patients. Therefore, the reasoning chain indicating a concern with diabetes is valid. In patients with asthma, propranolol can cause bronchoconstriction, potentially exacerbating asthma symptoms, which is also a significant concern. However, the reasoning chain for glaucoma is misleading; while propranolol can lower intraocular pressure, it is not contraindicated in glaucoma. For essential tremor, propranolol is often used as a treatment, so the concern is minimal. Lastly, in the case of supraventricular tachycardia, propranolol is used to manage this condition, so it is not a concern. Thus, the most significant concern regarding the use of propranolol in this patient would be if he also had diabetes.\"\n}",
