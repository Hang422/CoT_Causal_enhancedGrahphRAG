      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Tocilizumab used against Rheumatoid arthritis is a monoclonal antibody against :\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Interleukin-6\nopb. Interleukin-6 receptor\nopc. Interleukin-5\nopd. Interleukin-5 receptor\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Tocilizumab\" -> \"targets interleukin-6 receptor\" -> \"blocks interleukin-6 signaling\" -> \"reduces inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Tocilizumab\" -> \"monoclonal antibody\" -> \"binds to interleukin-6 receptor\" -> \"prevents interleukin-6 from binding\" -> \"decreases inflammatory response\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Tocilizumab\" -> \"inhibits interleukin-6 receptor\" -> \"modulates immune response\" -> \"alleviates symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis\" -> 92%\nCHAIN: \"Tocilizumab\" -> \"does not target interleukin-5\" -> \"does not target interleukin-5 receptor\" -> \"specific for interleukin-6 receptor\" -> 85%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(tocilizumab)-INTERACTS_WITH->(T-Lymphocyte)-Lymphocyte)->(Interleukin 6 Receptor)\n(tocilizumab)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cells)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Interleukin 6 Receptor)\n(Interleukin-6)-CAUSES->(Obesity)-CAUSES->(Rheumatoid Arthritis)\n(Interleukin-6)-COMPLICATES->(Disease)-CAUSES->(Rheumatoid Arthritis)\n(Interleukin 6 Receptor)-INTERACTS_WITH->(T-Lymphocyte)-Lymphocyte)->(Interleukin-6)-6)\n(Interleukin 6 Receptor)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cells)-LOCATION_OF->(Interleukin-6)-6)\n(tocilizumab)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Monoclonal Antibodies)\n(tocilizumab)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cells)-LOCATION_OF->(Monoclonal Antibodies)\n(Monoclonal Antibodies)-INTERACTS_WITH->(T-Lymphocyte)-LOCATION_OF->(Interleukin 6 Receptor)\n(Monoclonal Antibodies)-PART_OF->(Cells)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Interleukin 6 Receptor)\n(tocilizumab)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cells)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Interleukin-5)\n(tocilizumab)-TREATS->(Infiltration)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Interleukin-5)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Tocilizumab is a monoclonal antibody that specifically targets the interleukin-6 receptor (IL-6R). It binds to the IL-6R, preventing interleukin-6 (IL-6) from interacting with its receptor, thereby blocking IL-6 signaling. This action reduces inflammation and alleviates symptoms associated with rheumatoid arthritis. The reasoning chains for options 'opb' (Interleukin-6 receptor) are consistent with this consensus, while options 'opa' (Interleukin-6), 'opc' (Interleukin-5), and 'opd' (Interleukin-5 receptor) are incorrect as tocilizumab does not target these molecules. Evidence paths confirming the interaction of tocilizumab with the IL-6 receptor further support this conclusion.\"\n}",
