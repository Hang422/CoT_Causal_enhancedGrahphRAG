      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Drug of choice for pregnant female suspected of having a baby with congenital adrenal hyperplasia\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Dexamethasone\nopb. Betamethasone\nopc. Hydrocoisone\nopd. Prednisolone\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Congenital adrenal hyperplasia\" -> \"risk of virilization in female fetus\" -> \"need to suppress fetal adrenal androgen production\" -> \"Dexamethasone crosses placenta\" -> \"suppresses fetal adrenal gland\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Congenital adrenal hyperplasia\" -> \"21-hydroxylase deficiency\" -> \"excess androgen production\" -> \"Dexamethasone reduces androgen production\" -> \"prevents virilization\" -> 80%\nCHAIN: \"Pregnant female\" -> \"fetal treatment needed\" -> \"Dexamethasone crosses placenta effectively\" -> \"direct fetal effect\" -> \"reduces androgen production\" -> 75%\nCHAIN: \"Congenital adrenal hyperplasia\" -> \"fetal adrenal suppression required\" -> \"Dexamethasone used for fetal treatment\" -> \"effective in reducing virilization risk\" -> 70%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Dexamethasone)-TREATS->(Virilism)\n(Visual Suppression)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(CACNA1A)-PART_OF->(Cells)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Dexamethasone)\n(Visual Suppression)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(CACNA1A)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Genes)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Dexamethasone)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"In cases of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), particularly due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency, there is a risk of virilization in female fetuses due to excess androgen production. The drug of choice for managing this condition in pregnant females is Dexamethasone, as it effectively crosses the placenta and suppresses fetal adrenal androgen production, thereby reducing the risk of virilization. The reasoning chains confirm that Dexamethasone is effective in this context, with a consensus supporting its use for fetal treatment in CAH. Other options like Betamethasone, Hydrocortisone, and Prednisolone are not typically used for this specific indication. The evidence paths regarding Dexamethasone's role in treating virilism further support its use in this scenario.\"\n}",
