      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Fosphenytoin different from phenytoin in which of the following-\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Can be used in absence seizures\nopb. Can be mixed with saline\nopc. Can be given orally\nopd. It is the drug of choice for myoclonic seizures\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Fosphenytoin\" -> \"water-soluble prodrug\" -> \"can be mixed with saline\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Fosphenytoin\" -> \"not effective for absence seizures\" -> \"similar to phenytoin\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Fosphenytoin\" -> \"administered intravenously or intramuscularly\" -> \"not given orally\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Fosphenytoin\" -> \"not the drug of choice for myoclonic seizures\" -> \"similar to phenytoin\" -> 90%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(fosphenytoin)-TREATS->(Seizures)-CAUSES->(Epilepsies, Myoclonic)\n(fosphenytoin)-TREATS->(Seizures)\n(Seizures)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Pathogenesis)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(CYP2C9 gene|CYP2C9)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Phenytoin)\n(Seizures)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Pathogenesis)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Enzymes)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Phenytoin)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Fosphenytoin is a water-soluble prodrug of phenytoin, primarily used for the treatment of seizures. It differs from phenytoin in several key aspects: 1) Fosphenytoin can be mixed with saline, which is not the case for phenytoin, confirming the first option. 2) Fosphenytoin is not effective for absence seizures, aligning with the consensus that it is similar to phenytoin in this regard, thus the second option is incorrect. 3) Fosphenytoin is typically administered intravenously or intramuscularly and is not given orally, making the third option incorrect. 4) Fosphenytoin is not the drug of choice for myoclonic seizures, as other medications are preferred, confirming the fourth option is also incorrect. Therefore, the only correct distinction is that fosphenytoin can be mixed with saline.\"\n}",
