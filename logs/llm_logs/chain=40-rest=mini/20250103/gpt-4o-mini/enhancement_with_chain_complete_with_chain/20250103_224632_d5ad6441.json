      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Drug of choice for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder is:-\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Haloperidol\nopb. Imipramine\nopc. Alprazolam\nopd. Methylphenidate\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Methylphenidate\" -> \"increased dopamine and norepinephrine in brain\" -> \"improved attention and focus\" -> \"reduced hyperactivity\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Haloperidol\" -> \"antipsychotic effects\" -> \"dopamine receptor blockade\" -> \"not typically used for ADHD\" -> 20%\nCHAIN: \"Imipramine\" -> \"tricyclic antidepressant\" -> \"increased norepinephrine and serotonin\" -> \"possible use in ADHD but not first-line\" -> 40%\nCHAIN: \"Alprazolam\" -> \"benzodiazepine\" -> \"anxiolytic effects\" -> \"not effective for ADHD symptoms\" -> 10%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Norepinephrine)-TREATS->(Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder)\n(Methylphenidate)-ISA->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Norepinephrine)\n(Anti-Anxiety Effect)-Anxiety Effect)->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-CAUSES/COMPLICATES->(Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder)\n(Alprazolam)-TREATS->(Disease)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Virus)-LOCATION_OF->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Benzodiazepines)\n(Alprazolam)-TREATS->(Chronic Disease)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Virus)-LOCATION_OF->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Benzodiazepines)\n(Imipramine)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Antidepressive Agents)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Antidepressive Agents, Tricyclic)\n(Imipramine)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Antipsychotic Agents)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Antidepressive Agents, Tricyclic)\n(Antidepressive Agents, Tricyclic)-INTERACTS_WITH/ISA->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Norepinephrine)\n(Haloperidol)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Pathogenesis)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Receptors, Purinergic P1)-CAUSES->(Antipsychotic Effect)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"The drug of choice for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is methylphenidate. Methylphenidate works by increasing dopamine and norepinephrine levels in the brain, which improves attention and focus while reducing hyperactivity. This aligns with the consensus that stimulants, particularly methylphenidate and amphetamines, are first-line treatments for ADHD. In contrast, haloperidol is an antipsychotic that blocks dopamine receptors and is not typically used for ADHD. Imipramine, a tricyclic antidepressant, may have some efficacy in ADHD but is not considered a first-line treatment. Alprazolam, a benzodiazepine, is primarily used for anxiety and does not effectively treat ADHD symptoms. Therefore, the most appropriate choice based on current medical consensus is methylphenidate.\"\n}",
