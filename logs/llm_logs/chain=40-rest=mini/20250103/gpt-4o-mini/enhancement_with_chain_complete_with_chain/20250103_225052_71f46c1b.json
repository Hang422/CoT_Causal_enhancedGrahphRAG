      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Patients on isoniazid which vitamin deficiency is more likely to be seen.\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Vitamin B9\nopb. Vitamin B12\nopc. Vitamin B6\nopd. Vitamin B3\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Isoniazid\" -> \"interferes with pyridoxine metabolism\" -> \"Vitamin B6 deficiency\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Isoniazid\" -> \"increased excretion of pyridoxine\" -> \"Vitamin B6 deficiency\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Isoniazid\" -> \"possible interference with vitamin absorption\" -> \"Vitamin B6 deficiency\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Isoniazid\" -> \"pyridoxine antagonism\" -> \"Vitamin B6 deficiency\" -> 92%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(isoniazid)-TREATS->(Disease)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(uptake)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(pyridoxine)\n(pyridoxine)-TREATS->(Vitamin B 6 Deficiency)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Isoniazid is known to interfere with the metabolism of pyridoxine (Vitamin B6), leading to a deficiency. The consensus in pharmacology indicates that isoniazid can act as a pyridoxine antagonist and increase the excretion of pyridoxine, which supports the reasoning that Vitamin B6 deficiency is more likely in patients taking isoniazid. The evidence paths confirm that isoniazid's action is associated with the uptake and metabolism of pyridoxine, further supporting the conclusion that Vitamin B6 deficiency is the most relevant concern in this context.\"\n}",
