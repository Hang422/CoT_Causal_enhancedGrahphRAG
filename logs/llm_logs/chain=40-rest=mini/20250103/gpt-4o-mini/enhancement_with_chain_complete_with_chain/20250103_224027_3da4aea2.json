      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Ethambutol causes\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Retro bulbar neuritis\nopb. Deafness\nopc. Red urine\nopd. Peripheral neuritis\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Ethambutol\" -> \"optic nerve toxicity\" -> \"retro bulbar neuritis\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Ethambutol\" -> \"auditory system\" -> \"possible effect\" -> \"deafness\" -> 40%\nCHAIN: \"Ethambutol\" -> \"urinary system\" -> \"red urine\" -> 30%\nCHAIN: \"Ethambutol\" -> \"peripheral nerves\" -> \"possible effect\" -> \"peripheral neuritis\" -> 50%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Ethambutol)-TREATS->(Disease)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(physiological aspects)-PROCESS_OF->(Optic Nerve)\n(Ethambutol)-TREATS->(Disease)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Respiration)-PROCESS_OF->(Optic Nerve)\n(Ethambutol)-TREATS->(Disease)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Blood Circulation)-PROCESS_OF->(Optic Nerve)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Ethambutol is known to cause retrobulbar neuritis, which can lead to optic nerve toxicity and visual disturbances, making option (opa) correct. The evidence supports this association with the optic nerve. Ethambutol does not typically cause deafness (opb), as its primary toxicity is not directed at the auditory system, thus this option is less supported. While ethambutol can cause red urine (opc) due to its excretion, this is not a direct effect of the drug but rather a result of its metabolism and is not clinically significant. Peripheral neuritis (opd) is a possible side effect, but it is less commonly associated with ethambutol compared to retrobulbar neuritis. Therefore, the most consensus-supported option is (opa) retrobulbar neuritis.\"\n}",
