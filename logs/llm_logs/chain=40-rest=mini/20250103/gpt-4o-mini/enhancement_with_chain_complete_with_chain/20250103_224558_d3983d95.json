      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Physiology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Lipids are transferred from intestine to liver by\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Chylomicrons\nopb. VLDL\nopc. HDL\nopd. LDL\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Dietary fats\" -> \"absorbed in intestine\" -> \"packaged into chylomicrons\" -> \"transported via lymphatic system\" -> \"enter bloodstream\" -> \"delivered to liver\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Intestinal absorption\" -> \"formation of chylomicrons\" -> \"transport through lymphatics\" -> \"enter systemic circulation\" -> \"reach liver\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Chylomicrons\" -> \"carry triglycerides\" -> \"enter bloodstream\" -> \"deliver lipids to liver\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Intestinal lipids\" -> \"chylomicron formation\" -> \"lymphatic transport\" -> \"systemic circulation\" -> \"liver uptake\" -> 92%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Intestines)-LOCATION_OF->(Diastasis)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Chylomicrons)\n(Intestines)-LOCATION_OF->(Functional disorder)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Chylomicrons)\n(Chylomicrons)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cells)-LOCATION_OF->(Triglycerides)\n(Chylomicrons)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cultured Cells)-LOCATION_OF->(Triglycerides)\n(Dietary Fats)-CAUSES->(Symptoms)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(paracrine)-PROCESS_OF->(Intestines)\n(Blood Circulation)-PROCESS_OF->(Liver)\n(Triglycerides)-PREDISPOSES->(Cardiovascular Diseases)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Blood Circulation)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Lipids, specifically dietary fats, are absorbed in the intestine and packaged into chylomicrons. These chylomicrons are then transported through the lymphatic system and enter the bloodstream, ultimately delivering lipids to the liver. This process is well-supported by consensus in physiology, confirming that chylomicrons are the primary carriers of dietary lipids from the intestine to the liver. Other lipoproteins like VLDL, HDL, and LDL are involved in lipid transport but are not responsible for the initial transfer of dietary lipids from the intestine. Therefore, the correct answer is chylomicrons.\"\n}",
