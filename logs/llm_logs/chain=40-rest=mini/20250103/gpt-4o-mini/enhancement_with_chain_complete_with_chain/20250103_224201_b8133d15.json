      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Biochemistry.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        All the following are features of Cardiac muscle Except\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Striated\nopb. Large T tubules\nopc. Troponin system present\nopd. Caldesmon is impoant regulatory protein\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Cardiac muscle\" -> \"striated appearance\" -> \"similar to skeletal muscle\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Cardiac muscle\" -> \"large T tubules\" -> \"efficient calcium handling\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Cardiac muscle\" -> \"troponin system present\" -> \"regulation of contraction\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Cardiac muscle\" -> \"caldesmon as important regulatory protein\" -> \"possible conflict with known cardiac muscle regulation\" -> 70%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Myocardium)-PART_OF->(Ovarian Follicle)-LOCATION_OF->(Regulatory Protein)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Cardiac muscle is characterized by several key features: it is striated, similar to skeletal muscle, which confirms option (a) as correct. Cardiac muscle has large T tubules that facilitate efficient calcium handling, supporting option (b) as correct. The presence of a troponin system in cardiac muscle is crucial for the regulation of contraction, making option (c) correct as well. However, option (d) is incorrect; caldesmon is not a significant regulatory protein in cardiac muscle, as cardiac muscle contraction is primarily regulated by the troponin-tropomyosin complex, not caldesmon. Therefore, the correct answer to the question is option (d).\"\n}",
