      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Drug which do not cause hyperprolactinemia:\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Bromocriptine\nopb. Haloperidol\nopc. Reserpine\nopd. Chlorpromazine\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Bromocriptine\" -> \"dopamine agonist\" -> \"inhibits prolactin release\" -> \"does not cause hyperprolactinemia\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Haloperidol\" -> \"dopamine antagonist\" -> \"increases prolactin release\" -> \"causes hyperprolactinemia\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Reserpine\" -> \"depletes monoamines\" -> \"possible increase in prolactin\" -> \"possible hyperprolactinemia\" -> 70%\nCHAIN: \"Chlorpromazine\" -> \"dopamine antagonist\" -> \"increases prolactin release\" -> \"causes hyperprolactinemia\" -> 90%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Bromocriptine)-ISA->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Dopamine)\n(Haloperidol)-INTERACTS_WITH/ISA->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Dopamine Antagonists)\n(Chlorpromazine)-INTERACTS_WITH/ISA->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Dopamine Antagonists)\n(Prolactin)-PREVENTS->(Hyperprolactinemia)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Bromocriptine is a dopamine agonist that inhibits prolactin release, thus it does not cause hyperprolactinemia. Haloperidol and Chlorpromazine are both dopamine antagonists that increase prolactin release, leading to hyperprolactinemia. Reserpine depletes monoamines and may lead to a possible increase in prolactin, but its effect is less clear compared to the direct actions of the other drugs. Therefore, the only drug listed that does not cause hyperprolactinemia is Bromocriptine.\"\n}",
