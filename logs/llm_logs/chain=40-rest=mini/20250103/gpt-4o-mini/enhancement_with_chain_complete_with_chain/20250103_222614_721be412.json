      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Which of the following drug causes Pseudotumour cerebri -\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Sparfloxacin\nopb. Tetracycline\nopc. Gentamicin\nopd. Clofazimine\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Tetracycline\" -> \"increased intracranial pressure\" -> \"Pseudotumour cerebri\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Sparfloxacin\" -> \"antibiotic effect\" -> \"no known link to Pseudotumour cerebri\" -> 20%\nCHAIN: \"Gentamicin\" -> \"ototoxicity\" -> \"no known link to Pseudotumour cerebri\" -> 10%\nCHAIN: \"Clofazimine\" -> \"skin discoloration\" -> \"no known link to Pseudotumour cerebri\" -> 15%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Clofazimine)-TREATS->(Disease)-CAUSES->(Discoloration of skin)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Among the options, Tetracycline is known to be associated with increased intracranial pressure, which can lead to Pseudotumour cerebri. This aligns with the consensus that Tetracycline can cause this condition. The other options, Sparfloxacin, Gentamicin, and Clofazimine, do not have established links to Pseudotumour cerebri, as they are primarily associated with other effects (antibiotic action, ototoxicity, and skin discoloration, respectively). Therefore, the most supported conclusion is that Tetracycline is the drug that causes Pseudotumour cerebri.\"\n}",
