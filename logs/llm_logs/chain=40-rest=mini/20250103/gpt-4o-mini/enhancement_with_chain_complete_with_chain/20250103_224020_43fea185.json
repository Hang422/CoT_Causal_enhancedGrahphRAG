      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        All of the following are true about Nizatidine except\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. It is a H2 blocker used in peptic ulcer disease\nopb. It has 100% Bioavailability\nopc. It also enhances gastric emptying\nopd. It can also lead to tachycardia\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Nizatidine\" -> \"H2 blocker\" -> \"used in peptic ulcer disease\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Nizatidine\" -> \"bioavailability\" -> \"less than -> 100%\nCHAIN: \"Nizatidine\" -> \"enhances gastric emptying\" -> \"possible\" -> 60%\nCHAIN: \"Nizatidine\" -> \"side effects\" -> \"tachycardia\" -> 70%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Nizatidine)-TREATS->(Disease)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Virus)-LOCATION_OF->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Histamine H2 Antagonists)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Nizatidine is indeed an H2 blocker used in the treatment of peptic ulcer disease, which aligns with the consensus (Option A is true). However, its bioavailability is not 100%; it is approximately 70% (Option B is false). Nizatidine does not significantly enhance gastric emptying, as its primary action is to reduce gastric acid secretion (Option C is misleading). Lastly, while tachycardia can occur with H2 blockers, it is not a common side effect of Nizatidine specifically (Option D is also misleading). Therefore, the correct answer is that Nizatidine does not have 100% bioavailability.\"\n}",
