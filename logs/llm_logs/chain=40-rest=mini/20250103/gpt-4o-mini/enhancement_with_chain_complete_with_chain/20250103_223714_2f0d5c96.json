      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Which among the following NOT a pharmacological action of opioids\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Cough suppression\nopb. Anti-emesis\nopc. Miosis\nopd. Truncal rigidity\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Opioids\" -> \"cough suppression\" -> \"common pharmacological action\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Opioids\" -> \"anti-emesis\" -> \"possible contradiction\" -> \"not a common action\" -> 80%\nCHAIN: \"Opioids\" -> \"miosis\" -> \"pupil constriction\" -> \"common pharmacological action\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Opioids\" -> \"truncal rigidity\" -> \"muscle stiffness\" -> \"common pharmacological action\" -> 90%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Analgesics, Opioid)-INTERACTS_WITH/ISA->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-TREATS->(Cough suppression)\n(Analgesics, Opioid)-TREATS->(Herpes zoster disease)-CAUSES->(Ocular-Ophthalmoplegia, Sympathetic)-CAUSES->(Miosis disorder)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Opioids are known for several pharmacological actions. Cough suppression is a recognized effect of opioids, as they can act on the cough center in the brain. Miosis, or pupil constriction, is a classic effect of opioid use due to their action on the central nervous system. Truncal rigidity, characterized by muscle stiffness, can occur with high doses of opioids, particularly during anesthesia. However, anti-emesis is not a common action of opioids; while some opioids can cause nausea, they are not typically used to prevent vomiting. Therefore, the option that is NOT a pharmacological action of opioids is anti-emesis.\"\n}",
