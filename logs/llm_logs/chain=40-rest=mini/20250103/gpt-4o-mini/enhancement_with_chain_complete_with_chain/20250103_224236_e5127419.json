      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        The patient is being administered i.v. quinine following which he developed restlessness and sweating, the most likely cause is :\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Hypoglycemia\nopb. Cinchonism\nopc. Arrhythmias\nopd. Sweating\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"i.v. quinine\" -> \"increased insulin secretion\" -> \"decreased blood glucose\" -> \"hypoglycemia\" -> \"restlessness and sweating\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"i.v. quinine\" -> \"cinchonism\" -> \"tinnitus, headache, dizziness\" -> \"restlessness\" -> 60%\nCHAIN: \"i.v. quinine\" -> \"cardiac effects\" -> \"arrhythmias\" -> \"restlessness and sweating\" -> 50%\nCHAIN: \"i.v. quinine\" -> \"direct stimulation of sweat glands\" -> \"sweating\" -> \"restlessness\" -> 40%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(cardiac arrhythmia)-CAUSES->(Symptoms)-CAUSES->(Agitation)\n(hypoglycemia)-CAUSES->(Agitation)\n(Tinnitus)-CAUSES->(Symptoms)-CAUSES->(Agitation)\n(cardiac arrhythmia)-CAUSES->(Disease)-CAUSES->(Agitation)\n(cardiac arrhythmia)-CAUSES->(Hypertensive disease)-CAUSES->(Agitation)\n(Tinnitus)-CAUSES->(Disease)-CAUSES->(Agitation)\n(Tinnitus)-CAUSES->(Pain)-CAUSES->(Agitation)\n(Dizziness)-CAUSES->(Disease)-CAUSES->(Agitation)\n(Dizziness)-CAUSES->(Hypertensive disease)-CAUSES->(Agitation)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Quinine, when administered intravenously, can lead to a condition known as cinchonism, which is characterized by symptoms such as tinnitus, headache, dizziness, and restlessness. This aligns with the second option, cinchonism, as the most likely cause of the patient's restlessness and sweating. While hypoglycemia is a potential concern due to quinine's effects on insulin secretion, it is less commonly associated with the specific symptoms of restlessness and sweating in this context. Cardiac arrhythmias can occur with quinine use, but they are not the primary cause of restlessness and sweating. Direct stimulation of sweat glands is not a well-documented effect of quinine. Therefore, the best-supported conclusion is that the patient's symptoms are most likely due to cinchonism.\"\n}",
