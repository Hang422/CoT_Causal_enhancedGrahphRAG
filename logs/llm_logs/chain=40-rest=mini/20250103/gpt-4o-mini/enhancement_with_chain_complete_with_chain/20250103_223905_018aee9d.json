      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Physiology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Functions of plasmin are all except-\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Fibrinolysis\nopb. Activation of collagenase\nopc. Destruction of VWF\nopd. Stabilization of fibrin\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Plasmin\" -> \"Fibrinolysis\" -> \"Breakdown of fibrin clots\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Plasmin\" -> \"Activation of collagenase\" -> \"Possible role in tissue remodeling\" -> 60%\nCHAIN: \"Plasmin\" -> \"Destruction of VWF\" -> \"Possible degradation of von Willebrand factor\" -> 70%\nCHAIN: \"Plasmin\" -> \"Stabilization of fibrin\" -> \"Unclear, contradicts fibrinolysis\" -> 20%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Destruction - action)-CAUSES->(Pathogenesis)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(von Willebrand Factor)\n(Destruction - action)-TREATS->(Complication)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(von Willebrand Factor)\n(Plasmin)-CAUSES->(Fibrinolysis)\n(Fibrin)-CAUSES->(Fibrinolysis)\n(Plasmin)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cells)-LOCATION_OF->(von Willebrand Factor)\n(Plasmin)-TREATS->(Complication)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(von Willebrand Factor)\n(Plasmin)-TREATS->(Fibrosis)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Fibrin)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Plasmin is primarily known for its role in fibrinolysis, which is the breakdown of fibrin clots, confirming option (a) as a correct function. The activation of collagenase (option b) is not a direct function of plasmin, as plasmin primarily acts on fibrin and does not activate collagenase, thus this option is misleading. Regarding option (c), plasmin can degrade von Willebrand factor (VWF), but this is not its primary function and is more of a secondary effect, making this option somewhat ambiguous. Finally, option (d) contradicts the established role of plasmin in fibrinolysis, as stabilization of fibrin would oppose its function. Therefore, the correct answer to the question is that plasmin does not stabilize fibrin.\"\n}",
