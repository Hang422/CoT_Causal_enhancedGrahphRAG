      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Chloroquine is useful in\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Discoid lupus erythematous\nopb. Rheumatoid ahritis\nopc. Infectious mononucleosis\nopd. All of the above\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Chloroquine\" -> \"anti-inflammatory effects\" -> \"improvement in discoid lupus erythematosus\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Chloroquine\" -> \"immunomodulatory effects\" -> \"potential benefit in rheumatoid arthritis\" -> 70%\nCHAIN: \"Chloroquine\" -> \"antiviral properties\" -> \"unclear effect on infectious mononucleosis\" -> 40%\nCHAIN: \"Chloroquine\" -> \"useful in discoid lupus erythematosus\" -> \"possible benefit in rheumatoid arthritis\" -> \"unclear effect on infectious mononucleosis\" -> 50%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Chloroquine)-TREATS->(Lupus Erythematosus, Discoid)\n(Rheumatoid Arthritis)-CAUSES->(Infection)-CAUSES->(Infectious Mononucleosis)\n(Rheumatoid Arthritis)-CAUSES->(Epstein-Barr Virus Infections)-CAUSES->(Infectious Mononucleosis)\n(Rheumatoid Arthritis)-CAUSES->(Urticaria)-COMPLICATES->(Infectious Mononucleosis)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Chloroquine is primarily recognized for its anti-inflammatory effects, making it useful in treating discoid lupus erythematosus, which is supported by consensus in dermatology and rheumatology. It also has immunomodulatory effects that may provide some benefit in rheumatoid arthritis, although this is less definitive. However, there is no strong evidence supporting the use of chloroquine in infectious mononucleosis, as its antiviral properties are not well established for this condition. Therefore, while chloroquine is beneficial for discoid lupus erythematosus and may have some role in rheumatoid arthritis, its relevance to infectious mononucleosis is unclear. Thus, the best-supported options are discoid lupus erythematosus and potentially rheumatoid arthritis, but not infectious mononucleosis.\"\n}",
