      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Aspirin is contraindicated in?\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Fever\nopb. Peptic ulcer\nopc. Unstable angina\nopd. Myalgia\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Aspirin\" -> \"inhibits prostaglandins\" -> \"reduces gastric mucosal protection\" -> \"increased risk of gastric bleeding\" -> \"peptic ulcer exacerbation\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Aspirin\" -> \"antiplatelet effect\" -> \"increased bleeding risk\" -> \"peptic ulcer bleeding\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Aspirin\" -> \"antipyretic effect\" -> \"reduces fever\" -> \"fever management\" -> 60%\nCHAIN: \"Aspirin\" -> \"anti-inflammatory effect\" -> \"reduces myalgia\" -> \"myalgia management\" -> 70%\nCHAIN: \"Aspirin\" -> \"antiplatelet effect\" -> \"prevents clot formation\" -> \"beneficial in unstable angina\" -> 80%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Aspirin)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Prostaglandins)\n(Aspirin)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Pathogenesis)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Prostaglandins)\n(Aspirin)-INTERACTS_WITH/ISA->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Antiplatelet)\n(Antipyretic Effect)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Interleukin-1 beta)-1 beta)->(Fever)\n(Clot formation)-DIAGNOSES->(Diabetes)-COMPLICATES/PREDISPOSES->(Unstable angina)\n(Gastric hemorrhage)-CAUSES->(Gastric ulcer)-CAUSES->(Peptic Ulcer)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Aspirin is contraindicated primarily in patients with peptic ulcers due to its ability to inhibit prostaglandins, which are crucial for maintaining gastric mucosal protection, thereby increasing the risk of gastric bleeding and exacerbating existing ulcers. The antiplatelet effect of aspirin also raises the risk of bleeding complications in these patients. In contrast, aspirin is beneficial in managing unstable angina due to its antiplatelet properties, and it is used for fever and myalgia management, making options related to fever and myalgia not contraindicated. Therefore, the correct answer is that aspirin is contraindicated in peptic ulcer.\"\n}",
