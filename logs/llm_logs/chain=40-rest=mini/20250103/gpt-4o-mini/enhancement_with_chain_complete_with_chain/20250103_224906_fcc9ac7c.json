      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Biochemistry.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Which of the following is the source of energy for a cardiac muscle at normal conditions?\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Fatty acids\nopb. Ketone bodies\nopc. Glucose\nopd. Any of the above\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Fatty acids\" -> \"beta-oxidation\" -> \"ATP production\" -> \"primary energy source\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Ketone bodies\" -> \"oxidation\" -> \"ATP production\" -> \"secondary energy source\" -> 70%\nCHAIN: \"Glucose\" -> \"glycolysis\" -> \"ATP production\" -> \"lesser energy source\" -> 60%\nCHAIN: \"Any of the above\" -> \"metabolized\" -> \"ATP production\" -> \"energy source\" -> 80%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Oxidation)-CAUSES->(Disease)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(uptake)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Adenosine Triphosphate)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"In normal conditions, cardiac muscle primarily utilizes fatty acids as its main source of energy through beta-oxidation, which is responsible for approximately 60-70% of ATP production. Ketone bodies can serve as a secondary energy source, especially during periods of fasting or low carbohydrate intake, contributing around 20-30% of ATP production. Glucose is also metabolized, primarily through glycolysis, but it is less favored under normal conditions, contributing about 10-20% of ATP production. Therefore, while all three substrates can be used for energy, fatty acids are the primary source, making the best answer 'Any of the above' as all can contribute to ATP production in varying degrees.\"\n}",
