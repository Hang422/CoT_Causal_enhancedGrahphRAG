      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Alpha la adrenergic blocker giving symptomatic relief in BPH?\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Tamsulosin\nopb. Prazosin\nopc. Oxazocin\nopd. Dolazoline\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Tamsulosin\" -> \"alpha-1 adrenergic blocker\" -> \"relaxation of smooth muscle in prostate\" -> \"improved urine flow\" -> \"symptomatic relief in BPH\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Prazosin\" -> \"alpha-1 adrenergic blocker\" -> \"relaxation of smooth muscle in prostate\" -> \"improved urine flow\" -> \"symptomatic relief in BPH\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Oxazocin\" -> \"alpha-1 adrenergic blocker\" -> \"relaxation of smooth muscle in prostate\" -> \"improved urine flow\" -> \"symptomatic relief in BPH\" -> 70%\nCHAIN: \"Dolazoline\" -> \"unclear mechanism in BPH\" -> \"possible alpha-adrenergic effects\" -> \"uncertain symptomatic relief in BPH\" -> 50%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Flow of urine)-PROCESS_OF->(Rectum)-LOCATION_OF->(Symptoms)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Tamsulosin is an alpha-1 adrenergic blocker that specifically targets the smooth muscle in the prostate and bladder neck, leading to relaxation and improved urine flow, providing symptomatic relief in benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Prazosin, another alpha-1 adrenergic blocker, also relaxes smooth muscle and can improve urine flow, but it is less commonly used for BPH compared to Tamsulosin. Oxazocin, while an alpha-1 blocker, is not typically used for BPH and has a lower efficacy in this context. Dolazoline has unclear mechanisms and is not primarily indicated for BPH, leading to uncertain symptomatic relief. Therefore, Tamsulosin is the most effective option for symptomatic relief in BPH, supported by its targeted action on prostate smooth muscle.\"\n}",
