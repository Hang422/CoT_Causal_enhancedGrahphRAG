      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Drug of choice for neurogenic diabetes insipidus\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Vasopressin\nopb. Terlipressin\nopc. Desmopressin\nopd. Pralipressin\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Neurogenic diabetes insipidus\" -> \"deficiency of vasopressin\" -> \"need for vasopressin replacement\" -> \"Desmopressin\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Neurogenic diabetes insipidus\" -> \"central cause\" -> \"synthetic vasopressin analog needed\" -> \"Desmopressin\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Neurogenic diabetes insipidus\" -> \"polyuria and polydipsia\" -> \"vasopressin analog to reduce symptoms\" -> \"Desmopressin\" -> 92%\nCHAIN: \"Neurogenic diabetes insipidus\" -> \"lack of antidiuretic hormone\" -> \"Desmopressin as synthetic replacement\" -> 93%\nCHAIN: \"Neurogenic diabetes insipidus\" -> \"treatment with vasopressin analog\" -> \"Desmopressin preferred\" -> 90%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Vasopressin Analog)-TREATS->(Hepatorenal Syndrome)-CAUSES->(Complication)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Deamino Arginine Vasopressin)\n(Vasopressin Analog)-TREATS->(Central Diabetes Insipidus)-PREDISPOSES->(Complication)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Deamino Arginine Vasopressin)\n(Central Diabetes Insipidus)-CAUSES/COMPLICATES->(Disease)-COMPLICATES->(Inflammatory Response)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(human AVP protein)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Neurogenic diabetes insipidus is characterized by a deficiency of vasopressin (antidiuretic hormone) due to a central cause, leading to symptoms such as polyuria and polydipsia. The treatment of choice is Desmopressin, a synthetic analog of vasopressin, which effectively reduces these symptoms by mimicking the action of vasopressin. Other options like Vasopressin, Terlipressin, and Pralipressin are not preferred for this specific condition. Evidence supports that Desmopressin is the preferred vasopressin analog for managing central diabetes insipidus, confirming its role in treating the deficiency of antidiuretic hormone.\"\n}",
