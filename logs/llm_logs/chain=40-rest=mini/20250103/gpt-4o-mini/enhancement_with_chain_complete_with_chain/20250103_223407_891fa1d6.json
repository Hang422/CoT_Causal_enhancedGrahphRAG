      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Which of the following antitussive can lead to hallucinations\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Morphine\nopb. Dextromethorphan\nopc. Diphenhydramine\nopd. Aprepitant\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Dextromethorphan\" -> \"NMDA receptor antagonism\" -> \"altered neurotransmission\" -> \"hallucinations\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Morphine\" -> \"opioid receptor activation\" -> \"central nervous system effects\" -> \"possible hallucinations\" -> 70%\nCHAIN: \"Diphenhydramine\" -> \"anticholinergic effects\" -> \"central nervous system effects\" -> \"possible hallucinations\" -> 60%\nCHAIN: \"Aprepitant\" -> \"neurokinin-1 receptor antagonism\" -> \"antiemetic effects\" -> \"unlikely hallucinations\" -> 40%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Dextromethorphan)-TREATS->(Complication)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(N-Methyl-D-Aspartate Receptors)\n(Dextromethorphan)-TREATS->(Functional disorder)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(N-Methyl-D-Aspartate Receptors)\n(aprepitant)-PREVENTS->(Inflammation)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Substance P Receptor)\n(Antiemetic Effect)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-CAUSES/TREATS->(Hallucinations)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Dextromethorphan is known to act as an NMDA receptor antagonist, which can lead to altered neurotransmission and is associated with hallucinations, particularly at high doses. Morphine, an opioid, can also cause central nervous system effects, including hallucinations, but this is less common and typically occurs at higher doses or in sensitive individuals. Diphenhydramine, an antihistamine with anticholinergic properties, can lead to central nervous system effects, including hallucinations, especially in the elderly or at high doses. Aprepitant, primarily an antiemetic through neurokinin-1 receptor antagonism, is unlikely to cause hallucinations and is not typically associated with such effects. Therefore, the antitussives most likely to lead to hallucinations are Dextromethorphan and Diphenhydramine.\"\n}",
