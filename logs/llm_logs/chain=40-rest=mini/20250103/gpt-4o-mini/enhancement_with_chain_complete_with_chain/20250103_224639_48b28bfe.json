      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        A 52 year old male presents to his physician with a chief complaint of a substantial increase in the size of his breasts over the past few months. Three months ago he was diagnosed with hypeension, and placed on antihypeensive medication. Which of the following medications was most likely prescribed?\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Captopril\nopb. Furosemide\nopc. Hydrochlorothiazide\nopd. Spironolactone\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Spironolactone\" -> \"anti-androgenic effects\" -> \"gynecomastia\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Hydrochlorothiazide\" -> \"possible hormonal imbalance\" -> \"possible gynecomastia\" -> 60%\nCHAIN: \"Captopril\" -> \"no known link to gynecomastia\" -> \"unlikely cause\" -> 20%\nCHAIN: \"Furosemide\" -> \"no known link to gynecomastia\" -> \"unlikely cause\" -> 20%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Captopril)-CAUSES->(Adverse effects)-CAUSES->(Gynecomastia)\n(Furosemide)-TREATS->(Adverse effects)-CAUSES->(Gynecomastia)\n(Hydrochlorothiazide)-TREATS->(Obesity)-CAUSES->(imbalance)\n(Hydrochlorothiazide)-TREATS->(Myocardial Infarction)-CAUSES->(imbalance)\n(Hydrochlorothiazide)-TREATS->(Diabetes Mellitus, Insulin-Dependent)-CAUSES->(imbalance)\n(Captopril)-TREATS->(Disease)-CAUSES->(Gynecomastia)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Spironolactone is known for its anti-androgenic effects, which can lead to gynecomastia, making it the most likely medication prescribed in this case. Hydrochlorothiazide has a potential link to hormonal imbalances, but the association with gynecomastia is less direct and less common. Captopril and Furosemide have no established links to gynecomastia, making them unlikely causes. Therefore, the most probable medication prescribed for this patient, given the substantial increase in breast size, is Spironolactone.\"\n}",
