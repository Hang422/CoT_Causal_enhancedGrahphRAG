      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Physiology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Actions of cholecystokinin include which one of the following?\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Contraction of gall bladder\nopb. Secretion of pancreatic juice rich in enzymes\nopc. Increases the secretion of enterokinase\nopd. All\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Cholecystokinin\" -> \"stimulates gall bladder\" -> \"contraction of gall bladder\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Cholecystokinin\" -> \"stimulates pancreas\" -> \"secretion of pancreatic juice\" -> \"rich in enzymes\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Cholecystokinin\" -> \"possible effect on enterokinase\" -> \"unclear increase in secretion\" -> 50%\nCHAIN: \"Cholecystokinin\" -> \"contraction of gall bladder\" -> \"secretion of pancreatic juice rich in enzymes\" -> \"no clear effect on enterokinase\" -> 85%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Cholecystokinin)-CAUSES->(fluid secretion)-PROCESS_OF->(Gallbladder)\n(Cholecystokinin)-CAUSES->(uptake)-PROCESS_OF->(Gallbladder)\n(Cholecystokinin)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cells)-INTERACTS_WITH->(ENTEROPEPTIDASE)\n(Gallbladder)-LOCATION_OF->(Pathogenesis)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Enzymes)\n(Gallbladder)-LOCATION_OF->(Lipopolysaccharides)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Enzymes)\n(Contraction)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Genes)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Enzymes)\n(Contraction)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(APEX1 protein, human|APEX1)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Enzymes)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Cholecystokinin (CCK) is a hormone that plays a crucial role in digestion. It is well-established that CCK stimulates the contraction of the gallbladder, facilitating the release of bile into the intestine (CHAIN: 'Cholecystokinin' -> 'stimulates gall bladder' -> 'contraction of gall bladder'). Additionally, CCK promotes the secretion of pancreatic juice that is rich in digestive enzymes, aiding in the digestion of fats and proteins (CHAIN: 'Cholecystokinin' -> 'stimulates pancreas' -> 'secretion of pancreatic juice' -> 'rich in enzymes'). However, the effect of CCK on enterokinase (also known as enteropeptidase) is less clear; while CCK interacts with cells that produce enterokinase, there is no strong consensus that it significantly increases its secretion (CHAIN: 'Cholecystokinin' -> 'possible effect on enterokinase' -> 'unclear increase in secretion'). Therefore, while options a and b are correct, option c lacks strong support. Thus, the best answer is option d, 'All', as it encompasses the confirmed actions of CCK, despite the uncertainty regarding enterokinase.\" \n}",
