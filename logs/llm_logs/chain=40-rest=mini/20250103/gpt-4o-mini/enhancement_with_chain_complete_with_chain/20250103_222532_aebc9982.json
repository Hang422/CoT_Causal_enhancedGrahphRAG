      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Which among the following drug is contra-indicated in renal failure?\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Pethidine\nopb. Morphine\nopc. Fentanyl\nopd. Atracurium\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Pethidine\" -> \"metabolized to normeperidine\" -> \"accumulation in renal failure\" -> \"neurotoxicity risk\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Morphine\" -> \"metabolized to active metabolites\" -> \"accumulation in renal failure\" -> \"increased sedation risk\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Fentanyl\" -> \"minimal active metabolites\" -> \"less accumulation in renal failure\" -> \"safer option\" -> 70%\nCHAIN: \"Atracurium\" -> \"Hofmann elimination\" -> \"independent of renal function\" -> \"safe in renal failure\" -> 90%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Atracurium)-TREATS->(Kidney Failure, Chronic)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Excretory function)\n(normeperidine)-TREATS->(Kidney Failure)\n(Atracurium)-TREATS->(Disease)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Excretory function)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Pethidine is contraindicated in renal failure due to its metabolism to normeperidine, which can accumulate and lead to neurotoxicity. Morphine is also problematic as it is metabolized to active metabolites that can accumulate in renal failure, increasing the risk of sedation. Fentanyl, however, has minimal active metabolites and is considered safer in renal failure due to less accumulation. Atracurium is metabolized via Hofmann elimination and is independent of renal function, making it safe for use in patients with renal failure. Therefore, both Pethidine and Morphine are contraindicated in renal failure, while Fentanyl and Atracurium are safer alternatives.\"\n}",
