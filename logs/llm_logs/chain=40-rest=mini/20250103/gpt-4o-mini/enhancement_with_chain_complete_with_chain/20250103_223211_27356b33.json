      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Redistribution phenomenon is seen in:\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Halothane\nopb. Ether\nopc. Thiopentone\nopd. All\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Thiopentone\" -> \"rapid distribution to brain\" -> \"initial high brain concentration\" -> \"redistribution to muscle and fat\" -> \"decreased brain concentration\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Halothane\" -> \"slow induction\" -> \"minimal redistribution\" -> \"unlikely redistribution phenomenon\" -> 60%\nCHAIN: \"Ether\" -> \"slow onset\" -> \"prolonged effect\" -> \"unlikely redistribution phenomenon\" -> 60%\nCHAIN: \"All\" -> \"includes Thiopentone\" -> \"known for redistribution\" -> \"possible redistribution in others\" -> 70%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Thiopental)-PREVENTS->(Excitability)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(voltage gated channel)-PROCESS_OF->(Brain)\n(Thiopental)-TREATS->(Obesity)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(paracrine)-PROCESS_OF->(Brain)\n(Thiopental)-TREATS->(Pain)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(paracrine)-PROCESS_OF->(Brain)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"The redistribution phenomenon is primarily associated with Thiopentone, which is known for its rapid distribution to the brain, leading to an initial high concentration followed by redistribution to muscle and fat, resulting in decreased brain concentration. Halothane and Ether, on the other hand, are characterized by slower induction and minimal redistribution, making them less likely to exhibit this phenomenon. Therefore, while Thiopentone clearly demonstrates redistribution, Halothane and Ether do not, leading to the conclusion that the correct answer is 'opc. Thiopentone' as the primary agent associated with the redistribution phenomenon.\"\n}",
