      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Physiology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Which of the following is the best-known metabolic function of the lung\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Inactivation of serotonin\nopb. Conversion of angiotensin–I to angiotensin–II\nopc. Inactivation of bradykinin\nopd. Metabolism of basic drugs by cytochrome P–450 system\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Lung\" -> \"presence of ACE\" -> \"conversion of angiotensin-I to angiotensin-II\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Lung\" -> \"inactivation of serotonin\" -> \"reduced serotonin levels\" -> 60%\nCHAIN: \"Lung\" -> \"inactivation of bradykinin\" -> \"reduced bradykinin activity\" -> 70%\nCHAIN: \"Lung\" -> \"cytochrome P-450 system\" -> \"metabolism of basic drugs\" -> \"possible\" -> 50%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Lung)-LOCATION_OF->(Bradykinin)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"The best-known metabolic function of the lung is the conversion of angiotensin-I to angiotensin-II, primarily due to the presence of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) in the pulmonary circulation. This process is crucial for regulating blood pressure and fluid balance. While the lung does have some capacity for the inactivation of serotonin and bradykinin, these functions are less significant compared to the role of ACE. The metabolism of basic drugs by the cytochrome P-450 system occurs primarily in the liver, making this option less relevant. Therefore, the most consensus-supported metabolic function of the lung is the conversion of angiotensin-I to angiotensin-II.\"\n}",
