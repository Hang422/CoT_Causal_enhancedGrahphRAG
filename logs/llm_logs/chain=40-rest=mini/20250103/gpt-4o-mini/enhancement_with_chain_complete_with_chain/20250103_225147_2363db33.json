      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Biochemistry.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        HMP shunt occurs in all organs except ?\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Liver\nopb. Adipose tissue\nopc. RBC\nopd. Brain\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"HMP shunt\" -> \"occurs in liver\" -> \"liver has high metabolic activity\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"HMP shunt\" -> \"occurs in adipose tissue\" -> \"adipose tissue requires NADPH for fatty acid synthesis\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"HMP shunt\" -> \"occurs in RBC\" -> \"RBC requires NADPH for maintaining reduced glutathione\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"HMP shunt\" -> \"occurs in brain\" -> \"brain requires NADPH for biosynthetic reactions\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"HMP shunt\" -> \"does not occur in RBC\" -> \"RBC lacks mitochondria\" -> \"RBC relies on glycolysis\" -> 95%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Erythrocytes)-INTERACTS_WITH/LOCATION_OF->(ATP8A2 gene|ATP8A2)-PART_OF->(Mitochondria)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"The HMP shunt, also known as the pentose phosphate pathway, is crucial for generating NADPH and ribose-5-phosphate. It occurs in various tissues, including the liver, adipose tissue, and brain, where NADPH is essential for biosynthetic reactions. However, while red blood cells (RBCs) do utilize the HMP shunt for NADPH production, they lack mitochondria and primarily rely on glycolysis for energy. Therefore, the consensus indicates that the HMP shunt is not significantly active in RBCs compared to other tissues. Thus, the correct answer is that the HMP shunt occurs in all organs except RBCs.\"\n}",
