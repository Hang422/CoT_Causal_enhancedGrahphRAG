      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Physiology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Major hormone secreted by zona reticularis of adrenal coex ?\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Glucocoicoids\nopb. Mineralcoicoids\nopc. Aldosterone\nopd. Androgens\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Zona reticularis\" -> \"produces androgens\" -> \"major hormone secreted\" -> \"androgens\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Zona reticularis\" -> \"produces some glucocorticoids\" -> \"possible minor secretion\" -> \"glucocorticoids\" -> 60%\nCHAIN: \"Zona reticularis\" -> \"does not primarily produce mineralocorticoids\" -> \"unlikely major hormone\" -> \"mineralocorticoids\" -> 20%\nCHAIN: \"Zona reticularis\" -> \"does not produce aldosterone\" -> \"aldosterone not secreted\" -> \"aldosterone\" -> 10%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Zona Reticularis)-LOCATION_OF->(Androgens)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Glucocorticoids)\n(Zona Reticularis)-LOCATION_OF->(Lipids)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Aldosterone)\n(Zona Reticularis)-PART_OF->(Brain)-LOCATION_OF->(Aldosterone)\n(Zona Reticularis)-LOCATION_OF->(Androgens)\n(Zona Reticularis)-LOCATION_OF->(Corticosterone)-INTERACTS_WITH/ISA->(Mineralocorticoids)\n(Androgens)-INTERACTS_WITH/ISA->(Hormones)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"The zona reticularis of the adrenal cortex primarily produces androgens, such as dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and androstenedione. This aligns with the consensus that the major hormone secreted by this layer is androgens, making option 'opd. Androgens' the correct answer. While the zona reticularis can produce some glucocorticoids, this is not its primary function, and it does not produce mineralocorticoids or aldosterone, which are primarily secreted by the zona glomerulosa. Therefore, the reasoning chains for glucocorticoids, mineralocorticoids, and aldosterone have been adjusted or removed to reflect this consensus.\"\n}",
