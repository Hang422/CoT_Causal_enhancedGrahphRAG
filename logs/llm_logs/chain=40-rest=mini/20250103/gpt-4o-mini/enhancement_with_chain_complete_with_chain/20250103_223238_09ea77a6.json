      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Physiology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        All are TRUE about protease activated receptors, EXCEPT:\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Family of three seven transmembrane protein\nopb. Activated by thrombin\nopc. Releases PGE2\nopd. Protects epithelial cells\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Protease activated receptors\" -> \"family of four seven transmembrane proteins\" -> \"not family of three\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Protease activated receptors\" -> \"activated by thrombin\" -> \"signal transduction\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Protease activated receptors\" -> \"possible release of PGE2\" -> \"unclear mechanism\" -> 70%\nCHAIN: \"Protease activated receptors\" -> \"protects epithelial cells\" -> \"cellular defense\" -> 85%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Receptors, Proteinase-Activated)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cells)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Dinoprostone)\n(Receptors, Proteinase-Activated)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cells)-LOCATION_OF->(Thrombin)\n(Receptors, Proteinase-Activated)-INTERACTS_WITH->(mast cell)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Thrombin)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Protease activated receptors (PARs) are a family of four seven transmembrane proteins, not three, which makes option (a) incorrect. They are indeed activated by thrombin (option b), which is a well-established fact in the literature. While PARs can influence the release of various mediators, including PGE2, the mechanism is complex and not definitively established as a primary function (option c), thus making it less clear. However, PARs do play a role in cellular defense and can protect epithelial cells (option d), aligning with their function in tissue repair and inflammation. Therefore, the only incorrect statement is option (a).\"\n}",
