      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Physiology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        The most important action of Secretin is to\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. neutralize the acid from the stomach\nopb. increase secretion of bicarbonates by pancreas\nopc. decrease gastric secretion\nopd. cause contraction of pyloric sphincter\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Secretin\" -> \"stimulates pancreas\" -> \"increased secretion of bicarbonates\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Secretin\" -> \"neutralizes stomach acid\" -> \"possible\" -> 60%\nCHAIN: \"Secretin\" -> \"decreases gastric secretion\" -> \"possible\" -> 50%\nCHAIN: \"Secretin\" -> \"causes contraction of pyloric sphincter\" -> \"unclear\" -> 40%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Secretin)-CAUSES->(fluid secretion)-PROCESS_OF->(Pancreas)\n(Secretin)-CAUSES->(Vasodilation)-PROCESS_OF->(Pancreas)\n(Secretin)-CAUSES->(Excretory function)-PROCESS_OF->(Pancreas)\n(Secretin)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cells)-PART_OF->(Myenteric Plexus)-PART_OF->(Pyloric sphincter structure)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Secretin is primarily known for its role in stimulating the pancreas to increase the secretion of bicarbonate, which helps neutralize gastric acid in the duodenum. This aligns with the consensus that the most important action of secretin is to increase bicarbonate secretion by the pancreas (Option B). While secretin does have some effects on gastric secretion and interacts with the pyloric sphincter, these actions are secondary and less significant compared to its primary function. Therefore, the most accurate and consensus-supported answer is that secretin increases the secretion of bicarbonates by the pancreas.\"\n}",
