      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Which of the following about phenytoin is true ?\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. It follows zero order kinetics\nopb. Not an hepatic enzyme inducer\nopc. It is excreted unchanged in urine\nopd. It is not teratogenic\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Phenytoin\" -> \"zero order kinetics\" -> \"constant rate of elimination\" -> \"saturation of metabolic pathways\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Phenytoin\" -> \"hepatic enzyme inducer\" -> \"increased metabolism of other drugs\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Phenytoin\" -> \"metabolized in liver\" -> \"not excreted unchanged in urine\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Phenytoin\" -> \"teratogenic effects\" -> \"risk of fetal malformations\" -> 95%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Phenytoin)-CAUSES->(Teratogenesis)\n(Phenytoin)-CAUSES->(Disease)-CAUSES->(Hypertension, Portal)-CAUSES->(Measurement of liver enzyme)\n(Phenytoin)-TREATS->(Obesity)-CAUSES->(Hypertension, Portal)-CAUSES->(Measurement of liver enzyme)\n(Phenytoin)-TREATS->(Hypertensive disease)-CAUSES->(Hypertension, Portal)-CAUSES->(Measurement of liver enzyme)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Phenytoin is known to follow zero-order kinetics at therapeutic levels, meaning its elimination rate is constant and can become saturated, which supports option 'opa'. It is also a hepatic enzyme inducer, increasing the metabolism of other drugs, contradicting option 'opb'. Phenytoin is primarily metabolized in the liver and is not excreted unchanged in urine, which contradicts option 'opc'. Additionally, phenytoin is teratogenic and poses risks of fetal malformations, contradicting option 'opd'. Therefore, the only true statement is that phenytoin follows zero-order kinetics.\"\n}",
