      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Topical immunomodulator used for the treatment of genital was is:\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Imiquimod\nopb. Podophylline\nopc. Interferon\nopd. Acyclovir\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Imiquimod\" -> \"topical application\" -> \"immune response activation\" -> \"treatment of genital warts\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Podophylline\" -> \"topical application\" -> \"cytotoxic effect\" -> \"treatment of genital warts\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Interferon\" -> \"immune response modulation\" -> \"possible treatment of genital warts\" -> 70%\nCHAIN: \"Acyclovir\" -> \"antiviral activity\" -> \"treatment of herpes simplex virus\" -> \"not typically used for genital warts\" -> 60%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(imiquimod)-TREATS->(Inflammatory Response)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Genes)-PART_OF->(Endothelium)-LOCATION_OF->(topical application)\n(imiquimod)-TREATS->(Functional disorder)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Genes)-PART_OF->(Endothelium)-LOCATION_OF->(topical application)\n(Simplexvirus)-CAUSES->(Infection)-CAUSES->(Anogenital venereal warts)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Imiquimod is a topical immunomodulator that activates the immune response and is well-established for the treatment of genital warts, aligning with a consensus of its efficacy in this indication. Podophylline, while also a topical treatment, works through a cytotoxic mechanism rather than immunomodulation, making it less aligned with the question's focus on immunomodulators. Interferon can modulate the immune response but is not commonly used for genital warts, thus its relevance is lower. Acyclovir is an antiviral medication specifically for herpes simplex virus and is not used for genital warts. Therefore, the best answer is Imiquimod, supported by its established role in treating genital warts.\"\n}",
