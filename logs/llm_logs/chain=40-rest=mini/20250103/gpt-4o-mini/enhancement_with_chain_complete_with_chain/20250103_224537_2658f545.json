      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Biochemistry.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Inherited hyperammonemia is a result of deficiency of which enzyme of Krebs-Henseleit urea cycle?\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Malate dehydrogenase\nopb. Isocitrate dehydrogenase\nopc. N-acetyl glutamate synthetase\nopd. Succinate dehydrogenase\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"N-acetyl glutamate synthetase deficiency\" -> \"decreased N-acetylglutamate\" -> \"reduced activation of carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I\" -> \"impaired urea cycle\" -> \"accumulation of ammonia\" -> \"hyperammonemia\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Malate dehydrogenase deficiency\" -> \"impaired Krebs cycle\" -> \"possible metabolic disturbances\" -> \"unclear link to hyperammonemia\" -> 20%\nCHAIN: \"Isocitrate dehydrogenase deficiency\" -> \"impaired Krebs cycle\" -> \"possible metabolic disturbances\" -> \"unclear link to hyperammonemia\" -> 20%\nCHAIN: \"Succinate dehydrogenase deficiency\" -> \"impaired Krebs cycle\" -> \"possible metabolic disturbances\" -> \"unclear link to hyperammonemia\" -> 20%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(METABOLIC DISTURBANCE)-CAUSES->(Adverse effects)-CAUSES->(Hyperammonemia)\n(ammonia)-TREATS->(Hyperammonemia)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Inherited hyperammonemia is primarily associated with a deficiency in N-acetyl glutamate synthetase, which leads to decreased levels of N-acetylglutamate. This reduction impairs the activation of carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I, a key enzyme in the urea cycle, resulting in an inability to effectively convert ammonia into urea. Consequently, ammonia accumulates in the bloodstream, leading to hyperammonemia. The other options (malate dehydrogenase, isocitrate dehydrogenase, and succinate dehydrogenase) are involved in the Krebs cycle but do not have a direct link to hyperammonemia, as their deficiencies do not specifically disrupt the urea cycle. Therefore, the correct answer is N-acetyl glutamate synthetase deficiency.\"\n}",
