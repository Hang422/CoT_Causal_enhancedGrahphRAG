      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Pimozide belongs to class of:\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Thiothixanthene\nopb. Phenothiazine\nopc. Butyrophenone\nopd. Diphenyl butyl piperidine\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Pimozide\" -> \"antipsychotic medication\" -> \"used for Tourette's syndrome\" -> \"related to haloperidol\" -> \"butyrophenone class\" -> 70%\nCHAIN: \"Pimozide\" -> \"antipsychotic drug\" -> \"structurally similar to diphenyl butyl piperidine\" -> \"diphenyl butyl piperidine class\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Pimozide\" -> \"antipsychotic\" -> \"not a thiothixanthene\" -> \"not a phenothiazine\" -> \"not a butyrophenone\" -> \"diphenyl butyl piperidine\" -> 85%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Pimozide)-ISA->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Antipsychotic Agents)\n(Pimozide)-ISA->(Psychotropic Drugs)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Antipsychotic Agents)\n(Gilles de la Tourette syndrome)-PREDISPOSES->(Pathogenesis)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Receptors, Metabotropic Glutamate)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Haloperidol)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Pimozide is an antipsychotic medication primarily used for Tourette's syndrome. It is classified as a butyrophenone, which is a class of antipsychotic drugs that includes haloperidol. The reasoning chains indicate that Pimozide is related to haloperidol and belongs to the butyrophenone class, which is consistent with pharmacological consensus. The option indicating it as a diphenyl butyl piperidine is misleading, as while it may share structural similarities, it is not classified under that category. Therefore, the correct classification of Pimozide is as a butyrophenone.\"\n}",
