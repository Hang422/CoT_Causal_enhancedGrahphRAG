      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Physiology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        The Efferent fibers bundle of the substantia nigra transmits dopamine to one of the following areas\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Thalamus\nopb. Corpus striatum\nopc. Tegmentum of pons\nopd. Tectum of midbrain\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Substantia nigra\" -> \"dopamine production\" -> \"transmission to corpus striatum\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Substantia nigra\" -> \"dopamine production\" -> \"transmission to thalamus\" -> \"possible\" -> 60%\nCHAIN: \"Substantia nigra\" -> \"dopamine production\" -> \"transmission to tegmentum of pons\" -> \"unclear\" -> 50%\nCHAIN: \"Substantia nigra\" -> \"dopamine production\" -> \"transmission to tectum of midbrain\" -> \"unlikely\" -> 40%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Dopamine)-CAUSES->(Vasodilation)-PROCESS_OF->(Pontine structure)\n(Dopamine)-CAUSES->(Vasodilation)-PROCESS_OF->(Midbrain structure)\n(Substantia nigra structure)-PART_OF->(Brain)-LOCATION_OF->(Dopamine)\n(Dopamine)-CAUSES->(Disease)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Respiration)-PROCESS_OF->(Thalamic structure)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"The substantia nigra is a key structure in the brain that produces dopamine, primarily projecting to the corpus striatum, which is part of the basal ganglia and plays a crucial role in motor control. The reasoning chain for the corpus striatum is correct, as it is the primary target for dopaminergic projections from the substantia nigra, aligning with the consensus that this pathway is vital for movement regulation. The transmission of dopamine to the thalamus, tegmentum of pons, and tectum of midbrain is less direct and not the primary function of the substantia nigra, thus these options are less supported. The evidence paths regarding dopamine's role in various processes do not directly clarify the specific pathways from the substantia nigra but confirm its involvement in broader brain functions. Therefore, the best-supported answer is the corpus striatum.\"\n}",
