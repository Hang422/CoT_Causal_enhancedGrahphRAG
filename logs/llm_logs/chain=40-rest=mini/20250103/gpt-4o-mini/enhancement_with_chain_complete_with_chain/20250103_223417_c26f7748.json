      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Myoclonus in children is best treated by :\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Clonazepam\nopb. Sodium Valproate\nopc. Phenobarbitone\nopd. Ethosuximide\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Clonazepam\" -> \"enhanced GABAergic activity\" -> \"reduced neuronal excitability\" -> \"decreased myoclonus\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Sodium Valproate\" -> \"increased GABA levels\" -> \"stabilized neuronal membranes\" -> \"reduced myoclonus\" -> 80%\nCHAIN: \"Phenobarbitone\" -> \"increased GABAergic inhibition\" -> \"sedation\" -> \"possible reduction in myoclonus\" -> 60%\nCHAIN: \"Ethosuximide\" -> \"reduced T-type calcium currents\" -> \"effective in absence seizures\" -> \"unclear effect on myoclonus\" -> 50%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Sodium Valproate)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(gamma-Aminobutyric Acid)\n(Sodium Valproate)-PART_OF->(Cells)-INTERACTS_WITH->(gamma-Aminobutyric Acid)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Myoclonus in children is best treated with Sodium Valproate, which increases GABA levels and stabilizes neuronal membranes, leading to a reduction in myoclonus. Clonazepam enhances GABAergic activity, which can also reduce myoclonus, but it is generally less preferred due to potential sedation and tolerance issues. Phenobarbitone increases GABAergic inhibition but is primarily sedative and less effective for myoclonus. Ethosuximide is effective for absence seizures but has unclear effects on myoclonus. The evidence supports Sodium Valproate's role in increasing GABA levels, which is crucial for its therapeutic effect in myoclonus.\"\n}",
