      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Which of the following antitubercular drugs can be safely used in severe renal failure :\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Streptomycin\nopb. Ethambutol\nopc. Capreomycin\nopd. Rifampicin\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Streptomycin\" -> \"aminoglycoside antibiotic\" -> \"excreted by kidneys\" -> \"accumulates in renal failure\" -> \"not safe in severe renal failure\" -> 20%\nCHAIN: \"Ethambutol\" -> \"excreted by kidneys\" -> \"accumulates in renal failure\" -> \"dose adjustment needed\" -> \"not safe without adjustment\" -> 30%\nCHAIN: \"Capreomycin\" -> \"aminoglycoside-like antibiotic\" -> \"excreted by kidneys\" -> \"accumulates in renal failure\" -> \"not safe in severe renal failure\" -> 20%\nCHAIN: \"Rifampicin\" -> \"metabolized by liver\" -> \"minimal renal excretion\" -> \"safe in severe renal failure\" -> 90%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Streptomycin)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Disease)-PROCESS_OF->(Actinobacteria class)-LOCATION_OF->(Antibiotics, Aminoglycoside)\n(Streptomycin)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Disease)-PROCESS_OF->(Salmonella typhimurium)-LOCATION_OF->(Antibiotics, Aminoglycoside)\n(Ethambutol)-TREATS->(Epilepsy)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(voltage gated channel)-PROCESS_OF->(Kidney)\n(Ethambutol)-TREATS->(Disease)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(paracrine)-PROCESS_OF->(Kidney)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"In evaluating the antitubercular drugs for safety in severe renal failure, the following conclusions can be drawn: \\n\\n1. **Streptomycin**: This aminoglycoside antibiotic is primarily excreted by the kidneys. In severe renal failure, it can accumulate, leading to increased risk of toxicity. Therefore, it is not safe to use without careful monitoring and dose adjustment. \\n\\n2. **Ethambutol**: Ethambutol is also excreted by the kidneys and can accumulate in renal failure. Dose adjustment is necessary to avoid toxicity, making it not safe to use without such adjustments. \\n\\n3. **Capreomycin**: Similar to streptomycin, capreomycin is an aminoglycoside-like antibiotic that is excreted by the kidneys. It can accumulate in cases of renal failure, thus it is not safe in severe renal failure. \\n\\n4. **Rifampicin**: Rifampicin is primarily metabolized by the liver, with minimal renal excretion. This makes it safe to use in patients with severe renal failure, as it does not accumulate in the same way as the other options. \\n\\nIn summary, rifampicin is the only antitubercular drug among the options that can be safely used in severe renal failure, while streptomycin, ethambutol, and capreomycin pose risks due to potential accumulation.\"\n}",
