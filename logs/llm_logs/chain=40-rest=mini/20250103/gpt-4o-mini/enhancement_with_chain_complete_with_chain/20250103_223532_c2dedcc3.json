      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Physiology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        The placenta secretes a hormone that is utilized in the early detection of pregnancy. This hormone is:\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Endothelial growth factor (EGF)\nopb. Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG)\nopc. Human chorionic somatotropin (HCS)\nopd. Relaxin\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Placenta\" -> \"secretes hormone\" -> \"hCG\" -> \"early detection of pregnancy\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Placenta\" -> \"secretes hormone\" -> \"hCG\" -> \"detected in urine\" -> \"pregnancy test\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Placenta\" -> \"secretes hormone\" -> \"hCG\" -> \"detected in blood\" -> \"early pregnancy confirmation\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Placenta\" -> \"secretes hormone\" -> \"hCG\" -> \"rises in early pregnancy\" -> \"used in pregnancy tests\" -> 95%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Human Chorionic Gonadotropin)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cells)-LOCATION_OF->(Early Diagnosis)\n(Human Chorionic Gonadotropin)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cultured Cells)-LOCATION_OF->(Early Diagnosis)\n(Human Chorionic Gonadotropin)-CAUSES->(Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome)-COMPLICATES->(early pregnancy)\n(Human Chorionic Gonadotropin)-TREATS->(Disease)-CAUSES->(early pregnancy)\n(Human Chorionic Gonadotropin)-TREATS->(Pre-Eclampsia)-CAUSES->(early pregnancy)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"The placenta secretes Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG), which is the hormone utilized in the early detection of pregnancy. hCG is produced shortly after the embryo implants in the uterine lining and can be detected in both urine and blood, making it a reliable marker for pregnancy tests. The reasoning chains correctly highlight that hCG is associated with early pregnancy detection, with a high percentage of accuracy in these tests. The retrieved evidence paths support the role of hCG in early diagnosis, confirming its significance in pregnancy detection. Other options, such as Endothelial Growth Factor (EGF), Human Chorionic Somatotropin (HCS), and Relaxin, do not play a role in early pregnancy detection and are therefore not relevant to the question.\"\n}",
