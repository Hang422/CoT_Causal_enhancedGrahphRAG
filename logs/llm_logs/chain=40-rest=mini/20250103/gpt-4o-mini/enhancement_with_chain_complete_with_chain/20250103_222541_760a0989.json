      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Most potent mineralocoicoid is\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Aldosterone\nopb. DOCA\nopc. Fludrocoeisone\nopd. Triamcinolone\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Aldosterone\" -> \"strong sodium retention\" -> \"increased blood volume\" -> \"potent mineralocorticoid effect\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"DOCA\" -> \"moderate sodium retention\" -> \"increased blood volume\" -> \"less potent than aldosterone\" -> 70%\nCHAIN: \"Fludrocortisone\" -> \"strong sodium retention\" -> \"increased blood volume\" -> \"potent mineralocorticoid effect\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Triamcinolone\" -> \"minimal mineralocorticoid activity\" -> \"weak sodium retention\" -> \"not potent mineralocorticoid\" -> 60%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Aldosterone)-CAUSES->(Hypernatremia)\n(Desoxycorticosterone acetate)-CAUSES->(Hypernatremia)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Aldosterone is the most potent mineralocorticoid, primarily responsible for sodium retention and increasing blood volume, which aligns with its strong mineralocorticoid effect. DOCA (Desoxycorticosterone acetate) has moderate sodium retention but is less potent than aldosterone. Fludrocortisone is also a potent mineralocorticoid, but its potency is generally considered less than that of aldosterone. Triamcinolone, on the other hand, has minimal mineralocorticoid activity and is not considered a potent mineralocorticoid. Therefore, the consensus supports that aldosterone is the most potent mineralocorticoid.\"\n}",
