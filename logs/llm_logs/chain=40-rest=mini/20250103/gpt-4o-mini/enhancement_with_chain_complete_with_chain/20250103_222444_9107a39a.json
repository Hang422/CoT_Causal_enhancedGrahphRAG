      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        In a CA lung patient is suffering from dyspnoea, the palliation of dyspnoea is achieved by\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Morphine patch\nopb. Diazepam\nopc. Clobazam\nopd. Haloperidol\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Morphine patch\" -> \"binds to opioid receptors\" -> \"reduces perception of breathlessness\" -> \"palliation of dyspnoea\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Diazepam\" -> \"sedative effect\" -> \"reduced anxiety\" -> \"possible reduction in dyspnoea perception\" -> 60%\nCHAIN: \"Clobazam\" -> \"benzodiazepine effect\" -> \"sedation\" -> \"possible reduction in anxiety\" -> \"possible reduction in dyspnoea perception\" -> 55%\nCHAIN: \"Haloperidol\" -> \"antipsychotic effect\" -> \"sedation\" -> \"possible reduction in anxiety\" -> \"possible reduction in dyspnoea perception\" -> 50%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Morphine)-TREATS->(Obstruction)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Opioid Receptor)\n(Anxiety)-CAUSES->(Disease)-CAUSES->(Dyspnea)\n(Anxiety)-CAUSES->(Obesity)-CAUSES->(Dyspnea)\n(Anxiety)-CAUSES->(Hypertensive disease)-CAUSES->(Dyspnea)\n(Morphine)-TREATS->(Hypersensitivity)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Opioid Receptor)\n(Diazepam)-INTERACTS_WITH/ISA->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-CAUSES->(Sedative Effect)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"In the palliation of dyspnoea in cancer lung patients, the use of a morphine patch is supported by consensus as it binds to opioid receptors, effectively reducing the perception of breathlessness and providing significant relief (95% confidence). Diazepam and clobazam, while having sedative effects that may reduce anxiety and potentially improve dyspnoea perception, are less effective and not primarily indicated for dyspnoea management (60% and 55% confidence, respectively). Haloperidol, an antipsychotic, may also provide sedation and reduce anxiety, but its role in dyspnoea palliation is limited and less effective (50% confidence). Therefore, the morphine patch is the most appropriate option for managing dyspnoea in this context.\"\n}",
