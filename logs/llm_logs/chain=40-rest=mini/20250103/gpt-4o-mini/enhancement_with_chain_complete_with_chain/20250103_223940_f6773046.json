      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Ivermectin is indicated in all of the following except:\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Ascaris\nopb. Filariasis\nopc. Malaria\nopd. Oncocerciasis\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Ivermectin\" -> \"effective against Ascaris\" -> \"indicated for Ascaris\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Ivermectin\" -> \"effective against Filariasis\" -> \"indicated for Filariasis\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Ivermectin\" -> \"not effective against Malaria\" -> \"not indicated for Malaria\" -> 98%\nCHAIN: \"Ivermectin\" -> \"effective against Oncocerciasis\" -> \"indicated for Oncocerciasis\" -> 95%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Ivermectin)-TREATS->(Filariasis)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Ivermectin is an antiparasitic medication with specific indications. It is effective against Oncocerciasis (river blindness) and Filariasis, making it indicated for both conditions. However, it is not effective against Ascaris, a type of roundworm, as the primary treatment for Ascaris is typically albendazole or mebendazole. Importantly, Ivermectin is also not indicated for Malaria, which is caused by Plasmodium species and requires antimalarial drugs. Therefore, the correct answer is that Ivermectin is indicated in all of the following except Malaria.\"\n}",
