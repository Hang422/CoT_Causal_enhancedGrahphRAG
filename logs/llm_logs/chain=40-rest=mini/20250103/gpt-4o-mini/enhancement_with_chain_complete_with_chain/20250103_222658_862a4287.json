      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Schizophrenia is treated by:\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Anti depressants\nopb. Anti psychotics\nopc. Anti epileptics\nopd. Mood stabilizers\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Schizophrenia\" -> \"dopamine dysregulation\" -> \"need to block dopamine receptors\" -> \"use of antipsychotics\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Schizophrenia\" -> \"positive symptoms\" -> \"hallucinations and delusions\" -> \"antipsychotics reduce symptoms\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Schizophrenia\" -> \"negative symptoms\" -> \"social withdrawal and apathy\" -> \"antipsychotics may help\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Schizophrenia\" -> \"cognitive symptoms\" -> \"impaired attention and memory\" -> \"antipsychotics may improve\" -> 80%\nCHAIN: \"Schizophrenia\" -> \"antipsychotics\" -> \"dopamine receptor antagonism\" -> \"symptom control\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Schizophrenia\" -> \"antidepressants\" -> \"possible use for comorbid depression\" -> \"not primary treatment\" -> 60%\nCHAIN: \"Schizophrenia\" -> \"antiepileptics\" -> \"not standard treatment\" -> \"possible use for mood stabilization\" -> 50%\nCHAIN: \"Schizophrenia\" -> \"mood stabilizers\" -> \"not primary treatment\" -> \"possible use for mood symptoms\" -> 55%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Schizophrenia)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(physiological aspects)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Antipsychotic Agents)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Mood Stabilizers)\n(Schizophrenia)-CAUSES->(Symptoms)-CAUSES->(Neurobehavioral Manifestations)\n(Schizophrenia)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(physiological aspects)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Antipsychotic Agents)\n(Hallucinations)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Adverse effects)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(CYP2D6 gene|CYP2D6)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Antipsychotic Agents)\n(Schizophrenia)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Response to stimulus physiology)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Antidepressive Agents)\n(Schizophrenia)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Pathogenesis)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Genes)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Antidepressive Agents)\n(Schizophrenia)-PREDISPOSES->(Pathogenesis)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Genes)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Antiepileptic Agents)\n(Schizophrenia)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Pathogenesis)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(IMPACT gene)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Antiepileptic Agents)\n(Schizophrenia)-CAUSES->(Disease)-CAUSES->(Neurobehavioral Manifestations)\n(Schizophrenia)-CAUSES->(Alzheimer's Disease)-CAUSES->(Neurobehavioral Manifestations)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Schizophrenia is primarily treated with antipsychotics, which target dopamine dysregulation and are effective in reducing positive symptoms such as hallucinations and delusions. The reasoning chains confirm that antipsychotics are the mainstay of treatment, with a high consensus on their efficacy (95% for dopamine receptor antagonism and symptom control). While antidepressants may be used for comorbid depression, they are not the primary treatment for schizophrenia (60%). Antiepileptics and mood stabilizers are not standard treatments for schizophrenia, although they may have some role in managing mood symptoms or comorbid conditions (50% and 55% respectively). Evidence paths support the association of antipsychotic agents with the physiological aspects of schizophrenia, reinforcing their primary role in treatment.\"\n}",
