      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Following is not true concerning amyloidosis (NOT RELATED)\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Amyloidosis associated with multiple myeloma has the poorest prognosis\nopb. Fine - needle biopsy of subcutaneous abdominal fat is a simple & reliable method for diagnosing secondary systemic amyloidosis\nopc. Hepatic amyloid disease produces hepatomegaly but rarely jaundice\nopd. Amyloidosis of the spleen is associated with severe anemia\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Multiple myeloma\" -> \"associated with AL amyloidosis\" -> \"poor prognosis\" -> 80%\nCHAIN: \"Subcutaneous abdominal fat biopsy\" -> \"simple method\" -> \"reliable for diagnosing secondary systemic amyloidosis\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Hepatic amyloid disease\" -> \"hepatomegaly\" -> \"rarely jaundice\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Amyloidosis of the spleen\" -> \"splenic involvement\" -> \"possible anemia\" -> \"severe anemia unclear\" -> 60%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Spleen)-LOCATION_OF->(Anemia)\n(Amyloidosis)-CAUSES->(Disease)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Respiration)-PROCESS_OF->(Spleen)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Amyloidosis associated with multiple myeloma (AL amyloidosis) indeed has a poor prognosis, making option 'opa' true. Fine-needle biopsy of subcutaneous abdominal fat is a recognized method for diagnosing secondary systemic amyloidosis, thus option 'opb' is also true. Hepatic amyloid disease typically presents with hepatomegaly, and while jaundice can occur, it is not common, supporting option 'opc' as true. However, while splenic involvement in amyloidosis can lead to anemia, it does not typically cause severe anemia; thus, option 'opd' is misleading and not true. The evidence paths regarding the spleen and anemia do not clarify this point sufficiently to support severe anemia as a common manifestation. Therefore, the correct answer is option 'opd' as it is not true concerning amyloidosis.\"\n}",
