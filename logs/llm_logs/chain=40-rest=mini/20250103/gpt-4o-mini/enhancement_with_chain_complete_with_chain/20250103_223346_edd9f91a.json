      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Tamoxifen causes ?\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Osteoporosis\nopb. Endometrial hyperplasia\nopc. Ovarian cancer\nopd. Decreased triglyceride level\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Tamoxifen\" -> \"estrogen receptor modulation\" -> \"endometrial stimulation\" -> \"endometrial hyperplasia\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Tamoxifen\" -> \"estrogen receptor modulation\" -> \"bone density maintenance\" -> \"possible osteoporosis prevention\" -> 60%\nCHAIN: \"Tamoxifen\" -> \"estrogen receptor modulation\" -> \"decreased triglyceride synthesis\" -> \"decreased triglyceride level\" -> 80%\nCHAIN: \"Tamoxifen\" -> \"estrogen receptor modulation\" -> \"ovarian stimulation\" -> \"possible ovarian cancer risk\" -> 50%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Bone Density)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Menopause)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Contraceptives, Oral)-ISA->(Prophylactic treatment)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Tamoxifen is a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) primarily used in the treatment of estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer. It is known to cause endometrial hyperplasia due to its estrogenic effects on the endometrium, which aligns with the first option (opb). While Tamoxifen can have protective effects on bone density, it does not directly cause osteoporosis; rather, it may help prevent it in postmenopausal women (opA is misleading). The claim regarding decreased triglyceride levels (opd) lacks strong consensus support, as Tamoxifen's effects on lipid profiles are not well-established. Lastly, while there is some concern about ovarian stimulation and potential ovarian cancer risk (opc), the evidence is less definitive and does not establish a clear causal relationship. Therefore, the most accurate and consensus-supported outcome is that Tamoxifen causes endometrial hyperplasia.\"\n}",
