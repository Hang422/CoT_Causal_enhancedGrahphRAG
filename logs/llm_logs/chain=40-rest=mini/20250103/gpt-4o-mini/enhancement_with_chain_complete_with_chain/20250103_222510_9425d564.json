      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Physiology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Which of the following peptides are not produced by the renal system?\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Renin\nopb. Angiotensin I\nopc. Erythropoietin\nopd. 1,25DHCC\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Renin\" -> \"produced by juxtaglomerular cells in kidneys\" -> \"part of renal system\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Angiotensin I\" -> \"produced by conversion of angiotensinogen by renin\" -> \"occurs in bloodstream\" -> \"not directly produced by renal system\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Erythropoietin\" -> \"produced by interstitial fibroblasts in kidneys\" -> \"part of renal system\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"1,25DHCC\" -> \"active form of vitamin D\" -> \"converted in kidneys\" -> \"produced by renal system\" -> 90%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Angiotensin I)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Endothelial Cells)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cells)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Renin)\n(Angiotensin I)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Myocytes, Smooth Muscle)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Hematopoietic stem cells)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Renin)\n(Renin)-CAUSES->(Excretory function)-PROCESS_OF->(Kidney)\n(Renin)-CAUSES->(Thirst)-PROCESS_OF->(Kidney)\n(Erythropoietin)-CAUSES->(Cytoprotection)-PROCESS_OF->(Kidney)\n(Erythropoietin)-CAUSES->(Immunity)-PROCESS_OF->(Kidney)\n(Erythropoietin)-CAUSES->(biological adaptation to stress)-PROCESS_OF->(Kidney)\n(Renin)-CAUSES->(Hypertensive disease)-CAUSES->(Disease)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Blood Circulation)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Renin is produced by juxtaglomerular cells in the kidneys, confirming it is part of the renal system. Angiotensin I is not produced directly by the renal system; it is formed in the bloodstream from angiotensinogen by the action of renin, which is produced in the kidneys. Erythropoietin is produced by interstitial fibroblasts in the kidneys, making it part of the renal system. 1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25DHCC) is the active form of vitamin D, which is converted in the kidneys, thus it is also produced by the renal system. Therefore, the only peptide not produced by the renal system is Angiotensin I.\"\n}",
