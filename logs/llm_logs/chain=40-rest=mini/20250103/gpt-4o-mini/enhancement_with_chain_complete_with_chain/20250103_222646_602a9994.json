      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Propronolol is useful in all except -\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Atrial flutter\nopb. Parkinsonian tremor\nopc. Thyrotoxicosis\nopd. HOCM\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Propranolol\" -> \"beta-blocker\" -> \"decreases heart rate\" -> \"controls atrial flutter\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Propranolol\" -> \"beta-blocker\" -> \"reduces tremor\" -> \"possible effect on Parkinsonian tremor\" -> 60%\nCHAIN: \"Propranolol\" -> \"beta-blocker\" -> \"reduces sympathetic activity\" -> \"controls symptoms of thyrotoxicosis\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Propranolol\" -> \"beta-blocker\" -> \"reduces heart rate\" -> \"may worsen outflow obstruction in HOCM\" -> 85%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Tremor)-CAUSES->(Parkinsonian tremor)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Propranolol is a non-selective beta-blocker that is effective in various conditions. For atrial flutter, it is useful as it decreases heart rate and controls the rhythm, aligning with consensus (90% confidence). In the case of Parkinsonian tremor, propranolol may reduce tremors, but its effectiveness is not well-established and is generally considered less effective than other treatments, leading to a lower confidence (60%). Propranolol is also effective in managing symptoms of thyrotoxicosis by reducing sympathetic activity, which is well-supported (95% confidence). However, in hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM), propranolol can worsen outflow obstruction due to its heart rate-lowering effects, which is a known concern (85% confidence). Therefore, the option where propranolol is not useful is HOCM.\"\n}",
