      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Biochemistry.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Characteristics of glycoprotein:\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Protein linked with glycosidic bond\nopb. Core protein\nopc. Sugar residues are long in carbohydrate poion of glycoprotein\nopd. None\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Glycoprotein\" -> \"Protein linked with glycosidic bond\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Glycoprotein\" -> \"Core protein\" -> \"Possible\" -> 60%\nCHAIN: \"Glycoprotein\" -> \"Sugar residues\" -> \"Long carbohydrate portion\" -> \"Unclear\" -> 50%\nCHAIN: \"Glycoprotein\" -> \"None of the above\" -> \"Unlikely\" -> 40%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Glycoproteins)-INTERACTS_WITH/PART_OF->(Cells)-LOCATION_OF->(Proteins)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Glycoproteins are proteins that have carbohydrate moieties attached to them via glycosidic bonds, confirming option 'opa' as correct. The term 'core protein' in option 'opb' is somewhat vague; while glycoproteins do have a core protein component, this description lacks specificity and clarity, making it less definitive. Option 'opc' suggests that sugar residues are long in the carbohydrate portion of glycoproteins, which is not universally true as glycoproteins can have varying lengths of carbohydrate chains. Therefore, this option is misleading. Option 'opd' is incorrect as at least one of the previous options is valid. The evidence path regarding glycoproteins interacting with cells supports the functional role of glycoproteins in biological systems but does not directly clarify the characteristics of glycoproteins. Thus, the best-supported conclusion is that glycoproteins are indeed proteins linked with glycosidic bonds.\"\n}",
