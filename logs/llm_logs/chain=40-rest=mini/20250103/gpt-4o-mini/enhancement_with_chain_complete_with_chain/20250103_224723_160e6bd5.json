      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Physiology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Which of the following results in increase in secretion of ADH?\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Hypervolemia\nopb. Hypeension\nopc. Hypovolemia\nopd. Decrease osmolarity\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Hypovolemia\" -> \"decreased blood volume\" -> \"activation of baroreceptors\" -> \"stimulation of hypothalamus\" -> \"increased ADH secretion\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Hypervolemia\" -> \"increased blood volume\" -> \"decreased ADH secretion\" -> 10%\nCHAIN: \"Hypertension\" -> \"increased blood pressure\" -> \"decreased ADH secretion\" -> 10%\nCHAIN: \"Decrease osmolarity\" -> \"decreased plasma osmolarity\" -> \"decreased ADH secretion\" -> 10%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Hypothalamic structure)-LOCATION_OF->(Diastasis)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Alcohol dehydrogenase)\n(Hypothalamic structure)-LOCATION_OF->(Pathogenesis)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Alcohol dehydrogenase)\n(Stimulation procedure)-PREDISPOSES/TREATS->(Disease)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Diastasis)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Alcohol dehydrogenase)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"ADH (antidiuretic hormone) secretion is primarily regulated by blood volume and plasma osmolarity. In the case of hypovolemia, decreased blood volume activates baroreceptors, leading to stimulation of the hypothalamus and increased ADH secretion, which is consistent with the consensus (95% confidence). Conversely, hypervolemia and hypertension both result in increased blood volume and pressure, which lead to decreased ADH secretion (10% confidence each). A decrease in plasma osmolarity also results in decreased ADH secretion (10% confidence). Therefore, the only option that results in an increase in ADH secretion is hypovolemia.\"\n}",
