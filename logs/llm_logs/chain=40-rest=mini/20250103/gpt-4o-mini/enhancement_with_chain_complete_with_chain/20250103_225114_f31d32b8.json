      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Biochemistry.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Hypermagnesemia may be observed in:\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Hyperparathyroidism\nopb. Diabetes mellitus\nopc. Kwashiorkor\nopd. Primary aldosteronism\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Hyperparathyroidism\" -> \"increased parathyroid hormone\" -> \"increased renal reabsorption of magnesium\" -> \"hypermagnesemia\" -> 70%\nCHAIN: \"Diabetes mellitus\" -> \"possible renal impairment\" -> \"decreased magnesium excretion\" -> \"hypermagnesemia\" -> 60%\nCHAIN: \"Kwashiorkor\" -> \"protein malnutrition\" -> \"possible electrolyte imbalance\" -> \"unclear magnesium levels\" -> 50%\nCHAIN: \"Primary aldosteronism\" -> \"increased aldosterone\" -> \"increased renal excretion of magnesium\" -> \"hypomagnesemia\" -> 30%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Diabetes Mellitus)-CAUSES->(Renal Insufficiency)\n(Kwashiorkor)-CAUSES->(imbalance)\n(Conn Syndrome)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Pathogenesis)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Aldosterone)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Hypermagnesemia is characterized by elevated magnesium levels in the blood and can be associated with specific medical conditions. In hyperparathyroidism, increased parathyroid hormone leads to increased renal reabsorption of magnesium, which can contribute to hypermagnesemia. However, this is not a common cause, and hypermagnesemia is more typically associated with conditions like renal failure. In diabetes mellitus, renal impairment can lead to decreased magnesium excretion, potentially resulting in hypermagnesemia, although this is not a direct or common association. Kwashiorkor, a form of protein malnutrition, may lead to electrolyte imbalances, but its direct link to hypermagnesemia is unclear and not well established. In primary aldosteronism, increased aldosterone results in increased renal excretion of magnesium, leading to hypomagnesemia rather than hypermagnesemia. Therefore, the most relevant option for hypermagnesemia is hyperparathyroidism, but it is important to note that this is not a typical presentation. The other options do not support hypermagnesemia effectively.\"\n}",
