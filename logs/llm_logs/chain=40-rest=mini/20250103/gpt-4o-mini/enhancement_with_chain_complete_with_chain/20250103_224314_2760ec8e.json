      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Physiology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        In circulatory biomechanics which of the following is true?\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Blood viscosity is increased in anemia\nopb. Blood viscosity is decreased in polycythemia\nopc. Cardiac output is increased in anemia\nopd. Cardiac output is decreased in Beri-Beri\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Anemia\" -> \"decreased red blood cells\" -> \"decreased blood viscosity\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Polycythemia\" -> \"increased red blood cells\" -> \"increased blood viscosity\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Anemia\" -> \"decreased oxygen delivery\" -> \"increased cardiac output\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Beri-Beri\" -> \"thiamine deficiency\" -> \"impaired energy metabolism\" -> \"vasodilation\" -> \"increased cardiac output\" -> 80%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Erythrocytes)-INTERACTS_WITH/LOCATION_OF->(Hemoglobin)-CAUSES->(Blood Viscosity)\n(Anemia)-PROCESS_OF->(Streptococcus pneumoniae)-LOCATION_OF->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Erythrocytes)\n(Anemia)-CAUSES->(Adverse event)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Erythrocytes)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"In circulatory biomechanics, the following corrections and clarifications apply: 1. Blood viscosity is decreased in anemia due to a reduction in red blood cell mass, contradicting option opa. 2. Blood viscosity is increased in polycythemia, which is correctly stated in option opb. 3. Cardiac output is typically increased in anemia to compensate for decreased oxygen delivery, supporting option opc. 4. In Beri-Beri, characterized by thiamine deficiency, cardiac output can be increased due to vasodilation, contradicting option opd. Therefore, the correct statements are that blood viscosity is decreased in anemia (not increased) and increased in polycythemia, while cardiac output is increased in anemia and can be increased in Beri-Beri.\"\n}",
