      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Which of the following dings is not used for anxiety?\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Propanolol\nopb. Aiprazolam\nopc. Buspirone\nopd. Haloperidol\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Propanolol\" -> \"beta-blocker\" -> \"used for anxiety\" -> 80%\nCHAIN: \"Alprazolam\" -> \"benzodiazepine\" -> \"used for anxiety\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Buspirone\" -> \"anxiolytic\" -> \"used for anxiety\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Haloperidol\" -> \"antipsychotic\" -> \"not typically used for anxiety\" -> 85%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Benzodiazepines)-TREATS->(Anxiety)\n(Adrenergic beta-Antagonists)-CAUSES->(Anxiety)\n(Anti-Anxiety Agents)-CAUSES->(Anxiety)\n(Antipsychotic Agents)-TREATS->(Anxiety)\n(Propranolol)-INTERACTS_WITH/ISA->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Adrenergic beta-Antagonists)-Antagonists)\n(Buspirone)-ISA->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Anti-Anxiety Agents)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Propranolol is a beta-blocker primarily used for cardiovascular issues, but it can be used off-label for performance anxiety, making its role in anxiety treatment somewhat nuanced. Alprazolam is a benzodiazepine widely recognized for its efficacy in treating anxiety disorders. Buspirone is an anxiolytic specifically indicated for anxiety treatment. Haloperidol, an antipsychotic, is not typically used for anxiety and is primarily indicated for schizophrenia and acute psychosis. Therefore, the drug not used for anxiety is Haloperidol.\"\n}",
