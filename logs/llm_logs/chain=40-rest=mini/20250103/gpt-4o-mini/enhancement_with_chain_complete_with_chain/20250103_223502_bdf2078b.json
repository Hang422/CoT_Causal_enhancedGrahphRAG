      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Warfarin induced skin necrosis is seen in ?\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Protein C deficiency\nopb. Protein S deficiency\nopc. Hemophillia\nopd. Antithrombin III deficiency\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Warfarin administration\" -> \"reduced Protein C activity\" -> \"hypercoagulable state\" -> \"skin necrosis\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Warfarin administration\" -> \"reduced Protein S activity\" -> \"possible hypercoagulable state\" -> \"possible skin necrosis\" -> 60%\nCHAIN: \"Warfarin administration\" -> \"no effect on hemophilia\" -> \"no skin necrosis\" -> 10%\nCHAIN: \"Warfarin administration\" -> \"no significant effect on Antithrombin III\" -> \"no skin necrosis\" -> 10%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Antithrombin III)-TREATS->(Infection)-CAUSES->(Skin necrosis)\n(Antithrombin III)-TREATS->(Calciphylaxis)-CAUSES->(Skin necrosis)\n(Thrombophilia)-CAUSES->(Skin necrosis)\n(Hemophilia A)-CAUSES->(Disease)-CAUSES->(Skin necrosis)\n(Hemophilia A)-CAUSES->(Septicemia)-CAUSES->(Skin necrosis)\n(Hemophilia A)-CAUSES->(Rare Diseases)-CAUSES->(Skin necrosis)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Warfarin-induced skin necrosis is primarily associated with deficiencies in Protein C and Protein S. Warfarin works by inhibiting vitamin K-dependent clotting factors, which leads to a rapid decrease in Protein C and S levels, resulting in a transient hypercoagulable state that can cause skin necrosis. The reasoning chain for Protein C deficiency is strong, as it directly links to the mechanism of warfarin and the resultant skin necrosis. The chain for Protein S deficiency is also valid but less definitive, as the risk is lower compared to Protein C deficiency. Hemophilia does not cause skin necrosis related to warfarin, as it does not affect the coagulation pathway targeted by warfarin. Antithrombin III deficiency is similarly not directly linked to warfarin-induced skin necrosis, as warfarin does not significantly affect antithrombin levels. Therefore, the most relevant options are Protein C and Protein S deficiencies, with Protein C deficiency being the most strongly associated with warfarin-induced skin necrosis.\"\n}",
