      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Physiology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Digestion of disaccharides occurs at ?\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Mouth\nopb. Stomach\nopc. Small intestine\nopd. Large intestine\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Disaccharides\" -> \"reach small intestine\" -> \"enzymes like sucrase, lactase\" -> \"disaccharides broken down\" -> \"monosaccharides absorbed\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Disaccharides\" -> \"enter mouth\" -> \"no significant digestion\" -> \"pass to stomach\" -> \"no significant digestion\" -> \"reach small intestine\" -> \"enzymes like sucrase, lactase\" -> \"disaccharides broken down\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Disaccharides\" -> \"enter stomach\" -> \"acidic environment\" -> \"no significant digestion\" -> \"pass to small intestine\" -> \"enzymes like sucrase, lactase\" -> \"disaccharides broken down\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Disaccharides\" -> \"reach large intestine\" -> \"bacterial fermentation possible\" -> \"not primary site of digestion\" -> 50%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Disaccharides)-CAUSES->(Symptoms)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(paracrine)-PROCESS_OF->(Intestines)\n(Disaccharides)-CAUSES->(Fibrosis, Liver)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(paracrine)-PROCESS_OF->(Intestines)\n(Disaccharides)-CAUSES->(Disease)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Biological feedback)-PROCESS_OF->(Intestines)\n(Disaccharides)-CAUSES->(Disease)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(paracrine)-PROCESS_OF->(Stomach)\n(Disaccharides)-CAUSES->(Symptoms)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(paracrine)-PROCESS_OF->(Stomach)\n(Disaccharides)-CAUSES->(Fibrosis, Liver)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(paracrine)-PROCESS_OF->(Stomach)\n(SUCRASE)-CAUSES->(Enzyme Inhibition)-PROCESS_OF->(Brain)-LOCATION_OF->(Disaccharides)\n(Intestines)-LOCATION_OF->(Enzymes)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Disaccharides, such as sucrose and lactose, undergo significant digestion primarily in the small intestine. Enzymes like sucrase and lactase are secreted in the intestinal lining, breaking down disaccharides into monosaccharides, which are then absorbed into the bloodstream. While disaccharides enter the mouth and stomach, there is no significant digestion occurring in these areas due to the lack of specific enzymes. The large intestine may see some fermentation of undigested disaccharides by gut bacteria, but this is not the primary site for their digestion. Therefore, the correct answer is that digestion of disaccharides occurs at the small intestine.\"\n}",
