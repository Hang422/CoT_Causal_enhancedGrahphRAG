      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Biochemistry.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Urine osmolality in Diabetes insipidus is\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. <150 mmol/L\nopb. <300 mmol/L\nopc. <600 mmol/L\nopd. <900 mmol/L\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Diabetes insipidus\" -> \"decreased ADH effect\" -> \"inability to concentrate urine\" -> \"dilute urine\" -> \"low urine osmolality\" -> \"<300 mmol/L\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Diabetes insipidus\" -> \"polyuria\" -> \"excessive water loss\" -> \"dilute urine\" -> \"low urine osmolality\" -> \"<150 mmol/L\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Diabetes insipidus\" -> \"impaired water reabsorption\" -> \"dilute urine\" -> \"low urine osmolality\" -> \"<600 mmol/L\" -> 70%\nCHAIN: \"Diabetes insipidus\" -> \"lack of ADH\" -> \"inability to concentrate urine\" -> \"dilute urine\" -> \"low urine osmolality\" -> \"<900 mmol/L\" -> 60%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Diabetes Insipidus)-CAUSES->(Polyuria)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"In Diabetes Insipidus (DI), there is a deficiency of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) or a lack of response to it, leading to an inability to concentrate urine. This results in polyuria and the production of dilute urine with low osmolality. The typical urine osmolality in DI is generally less than 300 mmol/L, often falling below 150 mmol/L in severe cases. Therefore, the most accurate option reflecting the consensus is <300 mmol/L, as urine osmolality can vary but is consistently low due to the impaired water reabsorption. The evidence path indicating that DI causes polyuria supports this understanding.\"\n}",
