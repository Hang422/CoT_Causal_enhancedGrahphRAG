      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Brinzolamide is a\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Highly specific irreversible and noncompetitive carbonic anhydrase inhibitor\nopb. Highly specific irreversible and competitive carbonic anhydrase inhibitor.\nopc. Highly specific reversible and competitive carbonic anhydrose inhibitor\nopd. Highly specific reversible and non-competitive carbonic anhydrase inhibitor.\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Brinzolamide\" -> \"carbonic anhydrase inhibitor\" -> \"reversible binding\" -> \"competitive inhibition\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Brinzolamide\" -> \"carbonic anhydrase inhibitor\" -> \"reversible binding\" -> \"non-competitive inhibition\" -> 60%\nCHAIN: \"Brinzolamide\" -> \"carbonic anhydrase inhibitor\" -> \"irreversible binding\" -> \"competitive inhibition\" -> 50%\nCHAIN: \"Brinzolamide\" -> \"carbonic anhydrase inhibitor\" -> \"irreversible binding\" -> \"non-competitive inhibition\" -> 40%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(brinzolamide)-TREATS->(Disease)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Virus)-LOCATION_OF->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Carbonic Anhydrase Inhibitors)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Brinzolamide is a highly specific reversible and competitive carbonic anhydrase inhibitor. The consensus in pharmacology indicates that brinzolamide binds reversibly to the active site of carbonic anhydrase, leading to competitive inhibition of the enzyme. This aligns with the reasoning chain that identifies reversible binding and competitive inhibition as the correct characteristics of brinzolamide. The retrieved evidence path confirms its classification as a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, but does not provide additional relevant details for this specific question.\"\n}",
