      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Biochemistry.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        SACD (Subacute combined degeneration of cord) is feature of which vitamin deficiency?\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Vitamin A\nopb. Vitamin B6\nopc. Vitamin B9\nopd. Vitamin B12\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Vitamin B12 deficiency\" -> \"impaired myelin synthesis\" -> \"demyelination of spinal cord\" -> \"subacute combined degeneration of cord\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Vitamin B12 deficiency\" -> \"accumulation of methylmalonic acid\" -> \"neurotoxicity\" -> \"subacute combined degeneration of cord\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Vitamin B12 deficiency\" -> \"impaired DNA synthesis\" -> \"neural tissue damage\" -> \"subacute combined degeneration of cord\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Vitamin B12 deficiency\" -> \"neurological symptoms\" -> \"subacute combined degeneration of cord\" -> 90%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Vitamin B 12 Deficiency)-CAUSES->(Neurologic Symptoms)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Subacute combined degeneration of the cord is primarily associated with Vitamin B12 deficiency. This condition arises due to impaired myelin synthesis, leading to demyelination of the spinal cord. The deficiency also results in neurological symptoms and can cause the accumulation of methylmalonic acid, contributing to neurotoxicity. The consensus in medical literature confirms that Vitamin B12 is crucial for proper neurological function and its deficiency is directly linked to subacute combined degeneration of the cord.\"\n}",
