      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        INH induced neuropathy is treated with\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Thiamine\nopb. Pyridoxine\nopc. Niacin\nopd. Riboflavin\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"INH\" -> \"interferes with pyridoxine metabolism\" -> \"pyridoxine deficiency\" -> \"neuropathy\" -> \"pyridoxine supplementation\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"INH\" -> \"pyridoxine deficiency\" -> \"peripheral neuropathy\" -> \"pyridoxine corrects deficiency\" -> \"symptom improvement\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"INH\" -> \"decreased pyridoxine levels\" -> \"nerve damage\" -> \"pyridoxine administration\" -> \"nerve function restoration\" -> 92%\nCHAIN: \"INH\" -> \"pyridoxine depletion\" -> \"neuropathy symptoms\" -> \"pyridoxine replenishment\" -> \"symptom resolution\" -> 93%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(pyridoxine)-TREATS->(Neuropathy)\n(isoniazid)-TREATS->(Disease)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(uptake)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(pyridoxine)\n(isoniazid)-TREATS->(Symptoms)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(uptake)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(pyridoxine)\n(Neuropathy)-ISA/MANIFESTATION_OF->(Disease)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Saccharomyces cerevisiae)-LOCATION_OF->(pyridoxine)\n(Peripheral Neuropathy)-ISA/MANIFESTATION_OF->(Disease)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Saccharomyces cerevisiae)-LOCATION_OF->(pyridoxine)\n(isoniazid)-TREATS->(Vitamin B 6 Deficiency)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Isoniazid (INH) is known to interfere with pyridoxine (vitamin B6) metabolism, leading to pyridoxine deficiency, which can result in peripheral neuropathy. The consensus in pharmacology indicates that pyridoxine supplementation is the primary treatment for INH-induced neuropathy. The reasoning chains consistently support this, showing that pyridoxine administration can correct the deficiency and improve neuropathy symptoms. Evidence paths confirm the association between INH and pyridoxine deficiency, reinforcing the need for pyridoxine in treatment. Therefore, the best option for treating INH-induced neuropathy is pyridoxine.\"\n}",
