      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Use of tamoxifen for breast cancer can cause all ofthe following adverse effects, exceptaEUR'\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. >Thromboembolism\nopb. Endometrial carcinoma\nopc. >Carcinoma in contralateral breast\nopd. >Cataract\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Tamoxifen\" -> \"increased risk of thromboembolism\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Tamoxifen\" -> \"increased risk of endometrial carcinoma\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Tamoxifen\" -> \"possible protective effect on contralateral breast cancer\" -> 70%\nCHAIN: \"Tamoxifen\" -> \"increased risk of cataract\" -> 85%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Tamoxifen)-PREDISPOSES->(Thromboembolism)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Tamoxifen is associated with several adverse effects. It is known to increase the risk of thromboembolism and endometrial carcinoma, both of which are well-documented in clinical literature. The risk of cataracts is also noted, although the evidence is less definitive. However, tamoxifen is generally considered to have a protective effect against the development of carcinoma in the contralateral breast, which contradicts the notion that it causes this condition. Therefore, the correct answer to the question regarding which adverse effect is not caused by tamoxifen is carcinoma in the contralateral breast.\"\n}",
