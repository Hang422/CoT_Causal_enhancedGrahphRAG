      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Biochemistry.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Phenylketonuria caused by deficiency of\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Tyrosine transaminase\nopb. Tyrosine hydroxylase\nopc. Phenylalanine hydroxylase\nopd. Phenylketonuria hydroxylase\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Phenylalanine\" -> \"phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency\" -> \"accumulation of phenylalanine\" -> \"phenylketonuria\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Phenylalanine\" -> \"tyrosine hydroxylase\" -> \"dopamine synthesis\" -> \"not directly related to phenylketonuria\" -> 20%\nCHAIN: \"Phenylalanine\" -> \"tyrosine transaminase\" -> \"tyrosine metabolism\" -> \"not directly related to phenylketonuria\" -> 20%\nCHAIN: \"Phenylalanine\" -> \"phenylketonuria hydroxylase\" -> \"unclear enzyme\" -> \"not recognized in medical literature\" -> 10%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Phenylalanine)-TREATS->(Phenylketonurias)\n(Phenylketonurias)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Pathogenesis)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Phenylalanine)\n(Phenylketonurias)-ISA->(Acidemia)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Phenylalanine)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Phenylketonuria (PKU) is primarily caused by a deficiency in phenylalanine hydroxylase, an enzyme responsible for converting phenylalanine to tyrosine. This deficiency leads to the accumulation of phenylalanine in the body, which is toxic at high levels and results in the clinical manifestations of PKU. The reasoning chain for option 'opc' (Phenylalanine hydroxylase) is correct and aligns with consensus, while the other options (tyrosine transaminase, tyrosine hydroxylase, and phenylketonuria hydroxylase) do not directly relate to the pathophysiology of PKU. The evidence paths confirm the association of phenylalanine with PKU, reinforcing that the condition is indeed a result of phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency.\"\n}",
