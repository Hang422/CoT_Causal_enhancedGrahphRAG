      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Physiology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Aldosterone acts at:\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Collecting duct\nopb. Glomerulus\nopc. Proximal convoluted tubule\nopd. Loop of Henle\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Aldosterone\" -> \"acts on distal nephron\" -> \"specifically collecting duct\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Aldosterone\" -> \"sodium reabsorption\" -> \"water retention\" -> \"collecting duct involvement\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Aldosterone\" -> \"increased sodium channels\" -> \"collecting duct\" -> \"enhanced sodium reabsorption\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Aldosterone\" -> \"potassium excretion\" -> \"collecting duct\" -> \"electrolyte balance\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Aldosterone\" -> \"acts on nephron\" -> \"not glomerulus\" -> \"not proximal convoluted tubule\" -> \"not loop of Henle\" -> \"collecting duct\" -> 80%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Aldosterone)-CAUSES->(Vascular resistance)-PROCESS_OF->(Nephrons)\n(Aldosterone)-CAUSES->(Excretory function)-PROCESS_OF->(Nephrons)\n(Aldosterone)-CAUSES->(uptake)-PROCESS_OF->(Nephrons)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Aldosterone primarily acts on the collecting duct of the nephron, where it promotes sodium reabsorption and potassium excretion. This action is crucial for maintaining electrolyte balance and regulating blood pressure. The reasoning chains correctly identify the collecting duct as the site of action for aldosterone, supported by its role in increasing sodium channels and enhancing sodium reabsorption. Evidence paths indicating aldosterone's influence on nephron function further reinforce this consensus. Other options, such as the glomerulus, proximal convoluted tubule, and loop of Henle, do not align with the established understanding of aldosterone's specific actions.\"\n}",
