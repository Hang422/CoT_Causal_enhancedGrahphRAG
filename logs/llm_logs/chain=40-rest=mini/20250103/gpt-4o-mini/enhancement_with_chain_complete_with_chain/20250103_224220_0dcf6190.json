      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        The treatment of choice for bacterial vaginosis is :\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Clindamycin\nopb. Erythromycin\nopc. Ampicillin\nopd. Metronidazole\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Bacterial vaginosis\" -> \"anaerobic bacteria overgrowth\" -> \"Metronidazole targets anaerobes\" -> \"effective treatment\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Bacterial vaginosis\" -> \"anaerobic bacteria\" -> \"Clindamycin targets anaerobes\" -> \"possible treatment\" -> 70%\nCHAIN: \"Bacterial vaginosis\" -> \"broad-spectrum antibiotic needed\" -> \"Erythromycin less effective for anaerobes\" -> \"less preferred\" -> 50%\nCHAIN: \"Bacterial vaginosis\" -> \"broad-spectrum antibiotic needed\" -> \"Ampicillin less effective for anaerobes\" -> \"less preferred\" -> 50%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Bacteria, Anaerobic)-LOCATION_OF->(Clindamycin)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"The treatment of choice for bacterial vaginosis (BV) is Metronidazole, which effectively targets anaerobic bacteria associated with the condition. Clindamycin is also effective against anaerobes but is considered a second-line treatment. Erythromycin and Ampicillin are less effective for treating BV due to their limited action against anaerobic bacteria, making them less preferred options. The consensus supports Metronidazole as the first-line therapy, with Clindamycin as an alternative. Evidence confirms that both Metronidazole and Clindamycin target anaerobic bacteria, but Metronidazole is more widely recommended.\"\n}",
