      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Physiology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Shock causes:\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Stagnant hypoxia\nopb. Anemic hypoxia\nopc. Hypoxic hypoxia\nopd. Histotoxic hypoxia\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Shock\" -> \"decreased blood flow\" -> \"reduced oxygen delivery to tissues\" -> \"stagnant hypoxia\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Shock\" -> \"blood loss\" -> \"reduced hemoglobin\" -> \"anemic hypoxia\" -> 70%\nCHAIN: \"Shock\" -> \"impaired oxygen delivery\" -> \"tissue oxygen deficiency\" -> \"hypoxic hypoxia\" -> 80%\nCHAIN: \"Shock\" -> \"normal oxygen delivery\" -> \"cellular inability to utilize oxygen\" -> \"histotoxic hypoxia\" -> 60%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Shock)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Hemorrhage)\n(Oxygen)-COMPLICATES->(Hypoxia)\n(Body tissue)-LOCATION_OF->(Hypoxia)\n(Shock)-CAUSES->(Disease)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Blood Circulation)\n(Shock)-CAUSES->(Infection)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Blood Circulation)\n(Shock)-CAUSES->(Pre-Eclampsia)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Blood Circulation)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Shock can lead to various types of hypoxia based on the underlying mechanisms involved. 1. Stagnant hypoxia occurs due to decreased blood flow, which is a direct consequence of shock, leading to reduced oxygen delivery to tissues. 2. Anemic hypoxia is related to blood loss in shock, resulting in reduced hemoglobin levels and impaired oxygen transport. 3. Hypoxic hypoxia arises from impaired oxygen delivery to tissues, which can occur in shock due to various factors, including low blood pressure and inadequate perfusion. 4. Histotoxic hypoxia, however, is characterized by normal oxygen delivery but an inability of cells to utilize oxygen, which is not a direct consequence of shock itself. Therefore, while stagnant, anemic, and hypoxic hypoxia are all relevant to shock, histotoxic hypoxia is less directly related. The evidence paths confirm that shock affects blood circulation and can lead to hypoxia, supporting the relevance of the first three options.\"\n}",
