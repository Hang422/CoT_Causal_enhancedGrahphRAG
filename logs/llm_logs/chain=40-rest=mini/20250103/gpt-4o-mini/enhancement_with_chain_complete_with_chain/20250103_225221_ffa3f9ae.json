      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Biochemistry.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Cardiomyopathy is/are due to deficinency of:\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Selenium\nopb. Phosphorus\nopc. Boron\nopd. Zinc\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Selenium deficiency\" -> \"oxidative stress\" -> \"cardiomyopathy\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Phosphorus deficiency\" -> \"possible muscle weakness\" -> \"unclear link to cardiomyopathy\" -> 40%\nCHAIN: \"Boron deficiency\" -> \"unclear physiological impact\" -> \"unclear link to cardiomyopathy\" -> 30%\nCHAIN: \"Zinc deficiency\" -> \"immune dysfunction\" -> \"possible indirect cardiac effects\" -> 50%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Paresis)-CAUSES->(Disease)-CAUSES->(Cardiomyopathies)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Cardiomyopathy can be associated with various nutritional deficiencies, but the most relevant consensus points to selenium deficiency as a significant factor. Selenium plays a crucial role in antioxidant defense, and its deficiency has been linked to increased oxidative stress, which can lead to cardiomyopathy. The reasoning chain for selenium is thus supported: 'Selenium deficiency' -> 'oxidative stress' -> 'cardiomyopathy'. In contrast, phosphorus and boron deficiencies have unclear or weak links to cardiomyopathy, and while zinc deficiency may have indirect effects on cardiac health through immune dysfunction, it is not a direct cause of cardiomyopathy. Therefore, the most consensus-aligned option is selenium deficiency as a notable contributor to cardiomyopathy.\"\n}",
