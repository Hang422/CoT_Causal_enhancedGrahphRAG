Generate multiple reasoning chains for the following question.\n\n            Each chain:\n            - Uses '->' to connect sequential reasoning states.\n            - Each step is a single state or result, not a complete causal sentence in one step.\n              Example:\n                Correct: \"Insulin\" -> \"decreased blood glucose\" -> \"improved metabolism\" -> 90%\n                Incorrect: \"Insulin decreases blood glucose\" in one step.\n            - End with a confidence percentage (0-100%).\n\n            If a step clearly conflicts with widely accepted medical knowledge, you may indicate uncertainty (e.g., \n            \"possible\", \"unclear\") and slightly lower confidence. However, do this only if necessary. If unsure, \n            it is acceptable to show a plausible chain with moderate confidence.\n\n            ### Question\n            The following statements regarding insulin resistance in diabetic patients are true except:\n\n            ### Options\n    opa. It is more common with huminsulin\nopb. It may occur in the presence of infections\nopc. It may be due to antibodies to insulin\nopd. Use of glucocorticoids may be useful in severe cases\n\n            ### Instructions:\n            - Keep steps simple, each step just one state or outcome.\n            - '->' separates each step.\n            \n            ### Output Format:\n            Start each chain with \"CHAIN:\" on a new line.\n            Example:\n            CHAIN: \"Insulin\" -> \"decreased blood glucose\" -> \"improved metabolic state\" -> 90%"
