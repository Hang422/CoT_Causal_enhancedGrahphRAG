      "content": "\n        You are a medical expert. Generate multiple reasoning chains for the following question.\n\n            Each chain:\n            - Uses '->' to connect sequential reasoning states.\n            - Each step is a single state or result, not a complete causal sentence in one step.\n              Example:\n                Correct: \"Insulin\" -> \"decreased blood glucose\" -> \"improved metabolism\" -> 90%\n                Incorrect: \"Insulin decreases blood glucose\" in one step.\n            - End with a confidence percentage (0-100%).\n\n            If a step clearly conflicts with widely accepted medical knowledge, you may indicate uncertainty (e.g., \n            \"possible\", \"unclear\") and slightly lower confidence. However, do this only if necessary. If unsure, \n            it is acceptable to show a plausible chain with moderate confidence.\n\n            ### Question\n            All of the following are true about loop diuretics except:\n\n            ### Options\n    opa. They are called as \"high ceiling\" diuretics\nopb. They act on Na+.K+.2Cl- symporter\nopc. They can cause hyperuricemia\nopd. Loop diuretics lead to hypercalcemia and hypomagnesimia\n\n            ### Instructions:\n            - Keep steps simple, each step just one state or outcome.\n            - '->' separates each step.\n            \n            ### Output Format:\n            Start each chain with \"CHAIN:\" on a new line.\n            Example:\n            CHAIN: \"Insulin\" -> \"decreased blood glucose\" -> \"improved metabolic state\" -> 90%"

  "response": "CHAIN: Loop diuretics are known as \"high ceiling\" diuretics -> They inhibit the Na+.K+.2Cl- symporter in the loop of Henle -> They can lead to increased uric acid levels -> They typically cause hypocalcemia and hypomagnesemia -> Therefore, the statement about causing hypercalcemia is incorrect -> 85%\n\nCHAIN: Loop diuretics are classified as \"high ceiling\" diuretics -> They act on the Na+.K+.2Cl- symporter in the renal tubules -> They can cause elevated uric acid levels, known as hyperuricemia -> They usually result in hypocalcemia and hypomagnesemia -> The claim that they lead to hypercalcemia is false -> 90%\n\nCHAIN: Loop diuretics are referred to as \"high ceiling\" diuretics -> Their mechanism involves blocking the Na+.K+.2Cl- symporter -> They are associated with hyperuricemia due to increased uric acid reabsorption -> They generally cause hypocalcemia and hypomagnesemia -> The assertion that they cause hypercalcemia is not supported -> 80%",
