      "content": "\n        You are a medical expert. Generate multiple reasoning chains for the following question.\n\n            Each chain:\n            - Uses '->' to connect sequential reasoning states.\n            - Each step is a single state or result, not a complete causal sentence in one step.\n              Example:\n                Correct: \"Insulin\" -> \"decreased blood glucose\" -> \"improved metabolism\" -> 90%\n                Incorrect: \"Insulin decreases blood glucose\" in one step.\n            - End with a confidence percentage (0-100%).\n\n            If a step clearly conflicts with widely accepted medical knowledge, you may indicate uncertainty (e.g., \n            \"possible\", \"unclear\") and slightly lower confidence. However, do this only if necessary. If unsure, \n            it is acceptable to show a plausible chain with moderate confidence.\n\n            ### Question\n            A three year old child is brought to the emergency depament having just ingested a large overdose of an antihistaminic drug. This drug is a weak base capable of entering most tissues including the brain. On physical examination the hea rate is 100/ minute, blood pressure is 110/60 mm Hg and the respiratory rate is 20/ minute. In this case of poisoning:\n\n            ### Options\n    opa. Urinary excretion would be accelerated by administration of NH4Cl, an acidifying agent\nopb. Urinary excretion would be accelerated by administration of NaHCO 3, an alkalinizing agent\nopc. More of the drug would be ionized at blood pH than at stomach pH\nopd. Absorption of the drug would be faster from the stomach than from the small intestine.\n\n            ### Instructions:\n            - Keep steps simple, each step just one state or outcome.\n            - '->' separates each step.\n            \n            ### Output Format:\n            Start each chain with \"CHAIN:\" on a new line.\n            Example:\n            CHAIN: \"Insulin\" -> \"decreased blood glucose\" -> \"improved metabolic state\" -> 90%"
