      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Gp2b3A inhibitors are all except -\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Abciximab\nopb. Eptifibatide\nopc. Tirofiban\nopd. Prasugrel\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Gp2b3A inhibitors\" -> \"include abciximab, eptifibatide, and tirofiban\" -> \"prasugrel is an antiplatelet agent\" -> \"prasugrel is not a Gp2b3A inhibitor\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Gp2b3A inhibitors\" -> \"are used to prevent platelet aggregation\" -> \"abciximab, eptifibatide, and tirofiban are examples\" -> \"prasugrel functions differently\" -> \"prasugrel is not classified as a Gp2b3A inhibitor\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Gp2b3A inhibitors\" -> \"are a class of drugs\" -> \"abciximab, eptifibatide, and tirofiban belong to this class\" -> \"prasugrel is a thienopyridine\" -> \"prasugrel does not inhibit Gp2b3A\" -> 85%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(abciximab)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Anticoagulants)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(prasugrel)\n(abciximab)-TREATS->(Complication)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Alleles)-INTERACTS_WITH->(prasugrel)\n(thienopyridine)-TREATS->(Thrombosis)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(HPR gene|HPR)-INTERACTS_WITH->(prasugrel)\n(eptifibatide)-PREDISPOSES->(Complication)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Alleles)-INTERACTS_WITH->(prasugrel)\n(eptifibatide)-TREATS->(Abnormal renal function)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Alleles)-INTERACTS_WITH->(prasugrel)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Gp2b3A inhibitors are a class of drugs that specifically inhibit the glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor on platelets, preventing platelet aggregation. The main examples of Gp2b3A inhibitors include abciximab, eptifibatide, and tirofiban. In contrast, prasugrel is classified as a thienopyridine antiplatelet agent that works through a different mechanism by inhibiting the ADP receptor on platelets, thus it does not belong to the Gp2b3A inhibitor class. Therefore, the correct answer to the question is prasugrel, as it is not a Gp2b3A inhibitor.\"\n}",
