      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Which of the following anti-tubercular drug is avoided in a HIV positive patient on zidovudine, lamivudine and indinavir therapy who develops TB?\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Pyrazinamide\nopb. Isoniazid\nopc. Ethambutol\nopd. Rifampicin\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"HIV positive patient\" -> \"on zidovudine, lamivudine, and indinavir\" -> \"develops TB\" -> \"requires anti-tubercular therapy\" -> \"Rifampicin is a potent inducer of CYP450 enzymes\" -> \"may decrease levels of zidovudine and lamivudine\" -> \"risk of treatment failure or toxicity\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"HIV positive patient\" -> \"on zidovudine, lamivudine, and indinavir\" -> \"develops TB\" -> \"needs anti-tubercular drugs\" -> \"Isoniazid is generally safe\" -> \"Ethambutol is also safe\" -> \"Pyrazinamide may have some interactions\" -> \"but Rifampicin is the most concerning\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"HIV positive patient\" -> \"on zidovudine, lamivudine, and indinavir\" -> \"develops TB\" -> \"consideration of drug interactions\" -> \"Rifampicin can reduce effectiveness of HIV medications\" -> \"increased risk of adverse effects\" -> \"therefore, Rifampicin is avoided\" -> 95%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Lamivudine)-TREATS->(Tuberculosis)\n(Zidovudine)-TREATS->(Tuberculosis)\n(HIV)-INTERACTS_WITH->(2019 novel coronavirus)-LOCATION_OF->(Lamivudine)\n(HIV)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Hepatitis B Virus)-LOCATION_OF->(Lamivudine)\n(Cytochrome P450)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Disease)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Hepatitis B Virus)-LOCATION_OF->(Lamivudine)\n(Cytochrome P450)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Disease)-INTERACTS_WITH->(2019 novel coronavirus)-LOCATION_OF->(Lamivudine)\n(Indinavir)-TREATS->(Tuberculosis)\n(isoniazid)-TREATS->(Disease)-MANIFESTATION_OF/PREDISPOSES->(Pathogenesis)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(NPM1 gene|NPM1)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Ethambutol)\n(Drug Interactions)-CAUSES->(Tuberculosis)-PROCESS_OF->(HIV)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"In HIV positive patients on zidovudine, lamivudine, and indinavir therapy who develop TB, Rifampicin is avoided due to its potent induction of CYP450 enzymes, which can significantly decrease the plasma levels of zidovudine and lamivudine, leading to a risk of treatment failure or increased toxicity. Isoniazid and Ethambutol are generally considered safe in this context, while Pyrazinamide may have some interactions but is less concerning than Rifampicin. Therefore, the consensus is that Rifampicin poses the greatest risk of adverse drug interactions in this scenario.\"\n}",
