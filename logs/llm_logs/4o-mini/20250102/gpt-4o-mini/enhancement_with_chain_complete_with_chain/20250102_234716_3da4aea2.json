      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Ethambutol causes\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Retro bulbar neuritis\nopb. Deafness\nopc. Red urine\nopd. Peripheral neuritis\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Ethambutol\" -> \"inhibition of bacterial cell wall synthesis\" -> \"potential side effects\" -> \"retrobulbar neuritis\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Ethambutol\" -> \"known side effects\" -> \"visual disturbances\" -> \"retrobulbar neuritis\" -> 80%\nCHAIN: \"Ethambutol\" -> \"metabolized in the body\" -> \"possible toxic effects\" -> \"peripheral neuritis\" -> 75%\nCHAIN: \"Ethambutol\" -> \"not commonly associated with hearing loss\" -> \"deafness unlikely\" -> 60%\nCHAIN: \"Ethambutol\" -> \"urine color changes\" -> \"red urine\" -> \"possible but not common\" -> 70%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Ethambutol)-TREATS->(Disease)-CAUSES->(Deafness)\n(Ethambutol)-TREATS->(Infection)-CAUSES->(Deafness)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Ethambutol is primarily known for its potential side effects, particularly retrobulbar neuritis, which can lead to visual disturbances. This aligns with the consensus that retrobulbar neuritis is a recognized adverse effect of ethambutol, supported by the reasoning chains indicating its association with visual disturbances. Peripheral neuritis is also a possible side effect, though less commonly reported. However, ethambutol is not typically associated with deafness, contradicting the evidence paths suggesting a link to hearing loss. While ethambutol can cause urine color changes, red urine is not a common or well-documented side effect. Therefore, the most accurate and consensus-supported conclusion is that ethambutol causes retrobulbar neuritis.\"\n}",
