      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        INH induced neuropathy is treated with\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Thiamine\nopb. Pyridoxine\nopc. Niacin\nopd. Riboflavin\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"INH induced neuropathy\" -> \"associated with vitamin B6 deficiency\" -> \"Pyridoxine supplementation recommended\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"INH induced neuropathy\" -> \"neuropathy symptoms present\" -> \"consider vitamin supplementation\" -> \"Pyridoxine is effective\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"INH treatment\" -> \"can lead to peripheral neuropathy\" -> \"Pyridoxine is a known treatment\" -> \"reduces neuropathy symptoms\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"INH causes vitamin B6 depletion\" -> \"B6 is crucial for nerve function\" -> \"Pyridoxine corrects deficiency\" -> \"improves neuropathy\" -> 90%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(pyridoxine)-TREATS->(Neuropathy)\n(isoniazid)-TREATS->(Neuropathy)\n(Neuropathy)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Virus)-LOCATION_OF->(Ascorbic Acid)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Vitamin supplementation)\n(Peripheral Neuropathy)-ISA/MANIFESTATION_OF->(Disease)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Saccharomyces cerevisiae)-LOCATION_OF->(pyridoxine)\n(isoniazid)-TREATS->(Vitamin B 6 Deficiency)\n(isoniazid)-TREATS->(Peripheral Neuropathy)\n(Vitamin supplementation)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Genes)-INTERACTS_WITH->(pyridoxine)\n(pyridoxine)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Pathogenesis)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(SRY)-PART_OF->(Superior segmental bronchus)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Isoniazid (INH) can induce peripheral neuropathy primarily due to its interference with vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) metabolism, leading to a deficiency. Pyridoxine is crucial for nerve function, and its supplementation is recommended to prevent and treat INH-induced neuropathy. The reasoning chains consistently support that pyridoxine supplementation is effective in alleviating neuropathy symptoms associated with INH treatment. Evidence paths confirm that pyridoxine treats neuropathy and is associated with correcting vitamin B6 deficiency caused by isoniazid. Therefore, the best treatment for INH-induced neuropathy is pyridoxine.\"\n}",
