      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Biochemistry.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Nyctalopia is due to deficiency of\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Vitamin A\nopb. Vitamin B\nopc. Vitamin C\nopd. Vitamin E\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Nyctalopia\" -> \"impaired vision in low light\" -> \"associated with vitamin A deficiency\" -> \"Vitamin A is essential for rhodopsin production\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Nyctalopia\" -> \"difficulty seeing at night\" -> \"linked to retinal health\" -> \"Vitamin A is crucial for retinal function\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Nyctalopia\" -> \"visual impairment in dim light\" -> \"often caused by lack of vitamin A\" -> \"Vitamin A deficiency leads to reduced photoreceptor function\" -> 92%\nCHAIN: \"Nyctalopia\" -> \"night blindness\" -> \"deficiency of vitamin A\" -> \"Vitamin A is necessary for the regeneration of visual pigments\" -> 93%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Vitamin A)-TREATS->(Vitamin A Deficiency)\n(Vitamin A Deficiency)-PREDISPOSES->(Pathogenesis)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Rhodopsin)\n(Vitamin A Deficiency)-CAUSES->(Degenerative abnormality)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Rhodopsin)\n(Low Vision)-PREDISPOSES->(Disease)-CAUSES/PREDISPOSES->(Liver Dysfunction)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Vitamin A)\n(Night Blindness)-ISA/MANIFESTATION_OF->(Disease)-CAUSES->(Liver Dysfunction)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Vitamin A)\n(Retina)-PART_OF->(Eye)-LOCATION_OF->(Vitamin A)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Nyctalopia, or night blindness, is primarily caused by a deficiency of Vitamin A. This vitamin is essential for the production of rhodopsin, a visual pigment necessary for low-light vision. The reasoning chains consistently highlight the link between Vitamin A deficiency and impaired retinal function, confirming that Vitamin A is crucial for the regeneration of visual pigments. Evidence paths support this by indicating that Vitamin A deficiency is associated with rhodopsin and retinal health. Therefore, the correct answer is Vitamin A.\"\n}",
