      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Physiology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Iron is absorbed in: March 2012\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Stomach\nopb. Duodenum\nopc. Ileum\nopd. Duodenum + Jejunum\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Iron absorption occurs primarily in the gastrointestinal tract\" -> \"Duodenum is the first part of the small intestine\" -> \"Iron is absorbed in the duodenum\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Iron is absorbed in the small intestine\" -> \"Duodenum is a key site for nutrient absorption\" -> \"Iron absorption is highest in the duodenum\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Iron is absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract\" -> \"Duodenum and jejunum are involved in nutrient absorption\" -> \"Iron absorption occurs mainly in the duodenum\" -> 80%\nCHAIN: \"Iron absorption is a critical process\" -> \"Duodenum is known for iron absorption\" -> \"Jejunum also contributes to iron absorption\" -> \"Iron absorption occurs in duodenum + jejunum\" -> 75%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Iron)-CAUSES->(physiological aspects)-PROCESS_OF->(Duodenum)\n(Iron)-CAUSES->(Excretory function)-PROCESS_OF->(Duodenum)\n(Iron)-CAUSES->(biological adaptation to stress)-PROCESS_OF->(Duodenum)\n(Iron)-CAUSES->(Transformation, function)-PROCESS_OF->(jejunum)\n(Iron)-CAUSES->(Energy Metabolism)-PROCESS_OF->(jejunum)\n(Iron)-CAUSES->(physiological aspects)-PROCESS_OF->(jejunum)\n(Duodenum)-PART_OF->(Duodenal mucosa)-LOCATION_OF->(Iron)\n(Duodenum)-PART_OF->(Intestines)-LOCATION_OF->(Iron)\n(Intestines, Small)-PART_OF->(Kidney)-LOCATION_OF->(Iron)\n(Intestines, Small)-LOCATION_OF->(Carbohydrates)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Iron)\n(jejunum)-PART_OF->(Duodenum)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Iron absorption primarily occurs in the duodenum, which is the first part of the small intestine. While the jejunum also plays a role in iron absorption, the majority of iron is absorbed in the duodenum. This is supported by the consensus that the duodenum is a key site for nutrient absorption, particularly for iron. Therefore, the most accurate answer is that iron is absorbed in the duodenum, with some contribution from the jejunum. The evidence paths confirm the importance of the duodenum in iron absorption, while the jejunum's role is secondary.\"\n}",
