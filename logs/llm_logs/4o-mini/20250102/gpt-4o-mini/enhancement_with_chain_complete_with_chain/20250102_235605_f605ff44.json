      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        In which of the following patients would enalapril be the best first line agent for high blood pressure control ?\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. A 62 year old man with renal artery stenosis\nopb. A 32 year old pregnant female\nopc. A 41 year old woman with hyperkalemia\nopd. A 56 year old diabetic woman\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Enalapril is an ACE inhibitor\" -> \"reduces blood pressure by inhibiting angiotensin II\" -> \"beneficial in diabetic patients\" -> \"56 year old diabetic woman\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Enalapril is contraindicated in renal artery stenosis\" -> \"62 year old man with renal artery stenosis\" -> \"risk of renal failure\" -> \"not suitable\" -> 10%\nCHAIN: \"Enalapril is contraindicated in pregnancy\" -> \"32 year old pregnant female\" -> \"risk of fetal harm\" -> \"not suitable\" -> 5%\nCHAIN: \"Enalapril can increase potassium levels\" -> \"41 year old woman with hyperkalemia\" -> \"risk of worsening hyperkalemia\" -> \"not suitable\" -> 15%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Enalapril)-CAUSES->(hyperkalemia)\n(Enalapril)-CAUSES->(Disease)-CAUSES->(Renal Artery Stenosis)\n(Enalapril)-PREVENTS->(Obesity)-CAUSES->(Renal Artery Stenosis)\n(Enalapril)-PREVENTS->(Hypertensive disease)-COMPLICATES->(Renal Artery Stenosis)\n(Enalapril)-TREATS->(Fatty degeneration)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Angiotensin II)\n(Enalapril)-CAUSES->(Abnormal renal function)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Angiotensin II)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Enalapril is an ACE inhibitor that is effective in managing hypertension, particularly in patients with diabetes due to its renal protective effects. However, it is contraindicated in certain conditions. For the options: 1) A 62-year-old man with renal artery stenosis: Enalapril is contraindicated due to the risk of renal failure. 2) A 32-year-old pregnant female: Enalapril is contraindicated in pregnancy due to potential fetal harm. 3) A 41-year-old woman with hyperkalemia: Enalapril can exacerbate hyperkalemia, making it unsuitable. 4) A 56-year-old diabetic woman: Enalapril is beneficial for hypertension in diabetic patients, aligning with consensus. Therefore, the best first-line agent for high blood pressure control among the options is the 56-year-old diabetic woman.\"\n}",
