      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Biochemistry.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        True statement regarding insulin:\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Produced by alpha cells of pancreas\nopb. Two polypeptide chains are bound by disulfide linkages\nopc. Shifts potassium outside the cell\nopd. S.c insulin tl/2 is 60 mins\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Insulin is a hormone\" -> \"produced by beta cells of the pancreas\" -> \"not produced by alpha cells\" -> \"option a is incorrect\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: s\" -> \"connected by disulfide linkages\" -> \"this is a true statement\" -> \"option b is correct\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Insulin facilitates cellular uptake of glucose\" -> \"also affects potassium levels\" -> \"shifts potassium into the cell\" -> \"option c is incorrect\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Subcutaneous insulin has a half-life\" -> \"approximately 60 minutes\" -> \"this is a true statement\" -> \"option d is correct\" -> 85%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Insulin)-CAUSES->(Energy Metabolism)-PROCESS_OF->(Pancreas)\n(Insulin)-CAUSES->(physiological aspects)-PROCESS_OF->(Pancreas)\n(Insulin)-CAUSES->(Excretory function)-PROCESS_OF->(Pancreas)\n(Serum potassium assay)-DIAGNOSES->(Accelerated atrioventricular conduction)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cells)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Insulin is a hormone produced by beta cells of the pancreas, not alpha cells, making option a incorrect. Insulin consists of two polypeptide chains linked by disulfide bonds, confirming option b as correct. Insulin facilitates the uptake of glucose into cells and actually shifts potassium into the cell, which means option c is incorrect. The half-life of subcutaneous insulin is approximately 60 minutes, supporting option d as correct. Therefore, the true statements regarding insulin are options b and d.\"\n}",
