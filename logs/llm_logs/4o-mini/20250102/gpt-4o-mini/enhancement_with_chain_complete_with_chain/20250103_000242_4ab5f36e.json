      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        The 5α reductase inhibitor that has been found to be effective both in benign prostatic hypertrophy and male pattern baldness is:\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Flutamide\nopb. Finasteride\nopc. Prazosin\nopd. Minoxidil\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"5α reductase inhibitor\" -> \"reduces dihydrotestosterone levels\" -> \"effective in treating benign prostatic hypertrophy\" -> \"also effective in male pattern baldness\" -> \"Finasteride\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Finasteride\" -> \"inhibits 5α reductase\" -> \"lowers DHT\" -> \"improves urinary symptoms in BPH\" -> \"promotes hair regrowth in male pattern baldness\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"5α reductase inhibitors\" -> \"commonly used for BPH\" -> \"Finasteride is one of them\" -> \"also indicated for male pattern baldness\" -> \"other options do not have this dual indication\" -> 85%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Finasteride)-TREATS->(Androgenetic Alopecia)\n(Stanolone)-TREATS->(Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia)\n(Androgenetic Alopecia)-PREDISPOSES->(Atherosclerosis)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Genes)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Finasteride)\n(Androgenetic Alopecia)-PREDISPOSES->(Insulin Resistance)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Genes)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Finasteride)\n(Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia)-PREDISPOSES->(Complication)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Genes)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Finasteride)\n(Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia)-CAUSES->(Obstruction)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Genes)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Finasteride)\n(Finasteride)-PREVENTS/TREATS->(Complication)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Oxidoreductase)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Finasteride is a 5α reductase inhibitor that effectively reduces dihydrotestosterone (DHT) levels, which is beneficial in treating both benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH) and male pattern baldness (androgenetic alopecia). The reasoning chains confirm that Finasteride improves urinary symptoms in BPH and promotes hair regrowth in male pattern baldness, aligning with established medical consensus. Other options, such as Flutamide, Prazosin, and Minoxidil, do not have this dual indication. Evidence paths further support Finasteride's role in treating androgenetic alopecia and BPH, confirming its effectiveness in both conditions.\"\n}",
