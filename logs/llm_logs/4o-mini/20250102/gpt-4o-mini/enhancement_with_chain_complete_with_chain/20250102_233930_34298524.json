      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Brinzolamide is a\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Highly specific irreversible and noncompetitive carbonic anhydrase inhibitor\nopb. Highly specific irreversible and competitive carbonic anhydrase inhibitor.\nopc. Highly specific reversible and competitive carbonic anhydrose inhibitor\nopd. Highly specific reversible and non-competitive carbonic anhydrase inhibitor.\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Brinzolamide\" -> \"inhibits carbonic anhydrase\" -> \"reduces bicarbonate production\" -> \"decreases intraocular pressure\" -> \"highly specific reversible and non-competitive inhibitor\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Brinzolamide\" -> \"acts on carbonic anhydrase enzyme\" -> \"inhibits enzyme activity\" -> \"affects bicarbonate and hydrogen ion balance\" -> \"reversible and competitive inhibition\" -> \"possible\" -> 70%\nCHAIN: \"Brinzolamide\" -> \"is a sulfonamide derivative\" -> \"binds to carbonic anhydrase\" -> \"inhibits its function\" -> \"reversible and non-competitive\" -> 80%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(brinzolamide)-TREATS->(Disease)-MANIFESTATION_OF/PREDISPOSES->(Pathogenesis)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(CARBONATE DEHYDRATASE)\n(CARBONATE DEHYDRATASE)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cells)-LOCATION_OF->(Bicarbonates)\n(CARBONATE DEHYDRATASE)-CAUSES->(imbalance)-CAUSES->(Disease)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(physiological aspects)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Brinzolamide is a highly specific reversible and non-competitive carbonic anhydrase inhibitor. It acts by inhibiting the carbonic anhydrase enzyme, which reduces bicarbonate production and subsequently decreases intraocular pressure. This aligns with the consensus that brinzolamide, a sulfonamide derivative, binds to the enzyme in a reversible manner, affecting its function without permanently altering it. The evidence paths confirm the role of carbonic anhydrase in bicarbonate balance and its relevance in treating conditions like glaucoma, but they do not contradict the specific mechanism of brinzolamide.\"\n}",
