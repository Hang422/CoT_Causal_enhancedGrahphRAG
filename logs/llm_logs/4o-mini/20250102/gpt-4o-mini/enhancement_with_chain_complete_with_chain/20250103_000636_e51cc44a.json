      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Biochemistry.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Phenylketonuria caused by deficiency of\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Tyrosine transaminase\nopb. Tyrosine hydroxylase\nopc. Phenylalanine hydroxylase\nopd. Phenylketonuria hydroxylase\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Phenylketonuria\" -> \"deficiency of phenylalanine metabolism\" -> \"accumulation of phenylalanine\" -> \"deficiency of phenylalanine hydroxylase\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Phenylketonuria\" -> \"inability to convert phenylalanine to tyrosine\" -> \"deficiency of phenylalanine hydroxylase\" -> \"increased phenylalanine levels\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Phenylketonuria\" -> \"genetic mutation affecting enzyme function\" -> \"deficiency of phenylalanine hydroxylase\" -> \"disruption of normal metabolic pathway\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Phenylketonuria\" -> \"autosomal recessive disorder\" -> \"deficiency of phenylalanine hydroxylase\" -> \"impaired conversion of phenylalanine\" -> 90%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Phenylalanine Hydroxylase)-CAUSES->(Blood concentration results)-PREDISPOSES->(Dyslipidemias)-PREDISPOSES->(Pathogenesis)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Phenylalanine)\n(Autosomal Recessive Disorder)-CAUSES->(Atrophic)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Genes)-PART_OF->(Eukaryotic Cell)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Phenylalanine Hydroxylase)\n(Autosomal Recessive Disorder)-CAUSES->(Fibrosis)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Genes)-PART_OF->(Eukaryotic Cell)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Phenylalanine Hydroxylase)\n(Phenylketonurias)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Pathogenesis)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Tyrosine)\n(Phenylalanine)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cells)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Eukaryotic Cell)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Phenylalanine Hydroxylase)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Phenylketonuria (PKU) is primarily caused by a deficiency of phenylalanine hydroxylase, an enzyme responsible for converting phenylalanine to tyrosine. This deficiency leads to the accumulation of phenylalanine in the blood, which can result in neurological damage if not managed. The condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner, meaning that both copies of the gene must be mutated for the disorder to manifest. The reasoning chains correctly identify phenylalanine hydroxylase as the deficient enzyme in PKU, and the evidence paths support the relationship between phenylalanine metabolism and the disorder. Other options, such as tyrosine transaminase and tyrosine hydroxylase, are not directly related to the cause of PKU.\"\n}",
