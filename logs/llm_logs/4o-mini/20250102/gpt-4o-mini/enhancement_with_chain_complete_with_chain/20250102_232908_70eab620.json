      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        If a fibrinolytic drug is used for the treatment of acute myocardial infarction, the adverse effect most likely to occur is:\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Acute renal failure\nopb. Development of antiplatelet antibodies\nopc. Encephalitis secondary to liver dysfunction\nopd. Hemorrhagic stroke\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Fibrinolytic drug administration\" -> \"dissolution of thrombus\" -> \"restoration of blood flow\" -> \"risk of bleeding increases\" -> \"hemorrhagic stroke\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Fibrinolytic therapy\" -> \"increased fibrinogen breakdown\" -> \"potential for systemic bleeding\" -> \"risk of intracranial hemorrhage\" -> \"hemorrhagic stroke\" -> 80%\nCHAIN: \"Use of fibrinolytics\" -> \"increased risk of bleeding complications\" -> \"possible hemorrhagic events\" -> \"hemorrhagic stroke\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Fibrinolytic agents\" -> \"altered hemostasis\" -> \"increased bleeding tendency\" -> \"hemorrhagic stroke\" -> 75%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Intracranial Hemorrhages)-PREDISPOSES->(Hemorrhagic Stroke)\n(Hemorrhage)-CAUSES->(Subarachnoid Hemorrhage)-CAUSES->(Hemorrhagic Stroke)\n(Hemorrhage)-CAUSES->(Disease)-PREDISPOSES->(Hemorrhagic Stroke)\n(Hemorrhage)-CAUSES->(Cerebral Infarction)-PREDISPOSES->(Hemorrhagic Stroke)\n(Thrombus)-CAUSES->(Disease)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Blood Circulation)\n(Thrombus)-CAUSES->(Infection)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Blood Circulation)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Fibrinolytic drugs, used in the treatment of acute myocardial infarction, significantly increase the risk of bleeding complications due to their mechanism of action, which involves the dissolution of thrombi and restoration of blood flow. The most serious adverse effect associated with this therapy is hemorrhagic stroke, as evidenced by multiple reasoning chains indicating a direct correlation between fibrinolytic therapy and increased bleeding risk, particularly intracranial hemorrhage. The consensus in medical literature supports that the likelihood of hemorrhagic stroke is notably elevated in patients receiving fibrinolytics, making it the most probable adverse effect in this context.\"\n}",
