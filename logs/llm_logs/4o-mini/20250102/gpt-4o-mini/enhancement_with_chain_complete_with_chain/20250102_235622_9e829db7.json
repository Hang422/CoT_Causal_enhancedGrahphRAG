      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Which of the following antitubercular drugs can be safely used in severe renal failure :\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Streptomycin\nopb. Ethambutol\nopc. Capreomycin\nopd. Rifampicin\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Streptomycin\" -> \"primarily excreted by kidneys\" -> \"accumulation in severe renal failure\" -> \"risk of toxicity\" -> 70%\nCHAIN: \"Ethambutol\" -> \"partially renally excreted\" -> \"dose adjustment required in renal failure\" -> \"can be used with caution\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Capreomycin\" -> \"excreted by kidneys\" -> \"risk of nephrotoxicity in renal failure\" -> \"not recommended\" -> 60%\nCHAIN: \"Rifampicin\" -> \"primarily metabolized by liver\" -> \"minimal renal excretion\" -> \"generally safe in renal failure\" -> 90%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Streptomycin)-TREATS->(Infection)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(biological adaptation to stress)-PROCESS_OF->(Kidney)\n(Streptomycin)-TREATS->(Tuberculosis)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(biological adaptation to stress)-PROCESS_OF->(Kidney)\n(Streptomycin)-TREATS->(Infection)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(tissue tropism)-PROCESS_OF->(Kidney)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"In evaluating the antitubercular drugs for use in severe renal failure, the following consensus-aligned reasoning applies: \\n\\n1. **Streptomycin**: This drug is primarily excreted by the kidneys, leading to potential accumulation and increased risk of toxicity in patients with severe renal failure. Therefore, it is not recommended for use in this population. \\n\\n2. **Ethambutol**: Ethambutol is partially renally excreted, and while dose adjustments are necessary in renal failure, it can be used with caution. This aligns with the consensus that careful monitoring and adjustment can mitigate risks. \\n\\n3. **Capreomycin**: Similar to streptomycin, capreomycin is also excreted by the kidneys and poses a risk of nephrotoxicity in patients with renal impairment. It is generally not recommended in severe renal failure. \\n\\n4. **Rifampicin**: Rifampicin is primarily metabolized by the liver with minimal renal excretion, making it generally safe for use in patients with renal failure. This aligns with the consensus that it can be used without significant risk in this context. \\n\\nIn summary, Ethambutol can be used with caution with dose adjustments, and Rifampicin is considered safe in severe renal failure, while Streptomycin and Capreomycin are not recommended due to the risk of toxicity.\"\n}",
