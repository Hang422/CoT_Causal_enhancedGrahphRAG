      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Physiology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Lipids are transferred from intestine to liver by\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Chylomicrons\nopb. VLDL\nopc. HDL\nopd. LDL\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Lipids absorbed in intestine\" -> \"Chylomicrons formed in intestinal cells\" -> \"Chylomicrons enter lymphatic system\" -> \"Chylomicrons transported to bloodstream\" -> \"Chylomicrons deliver lipids to liver\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Dietary fats ingested\" -> \"Intestinal mucosa processes fats\" -> \"Chylomicrons released into circulation\" -> \"Chylomicrons carry lipids to liver\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Lipids from food\" -> \"Intestinal absorption\" -> \"Formation of chylomicrons\" -> \"Chylomicrons transport lipids to liver\" -> 92%\nCHAIN: \"Lipids enter bloodstream\" -> \"Chylomicrons transport lipids\" -> \"Chylomicrons deliver to liver\" -> 93%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Lipids)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Chylomicrons)\n(Chylomicrons)-CAUSES->(uptake)-PROCESS_OF->(Liver)\n(Intestines)-LOCATION_OF->(Diastasis)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Chylomicrons)\n(Intestines)-LOCATION_OF->(Functional disorder)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Chylomicrons)\n(intestinal cell)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Chylomicrons)\n(Chylomicrons)-TREATS->(Rheumatoid Arthritis)-CAUSES->(Disease)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Blood Circulation)\n(Chylomicrons)-TREATS->(Metabolic Diseases)-CAUSES->(Disease)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Blood Circulation)\n(Chylomicrons)-TREATS->(Chylomicronemia syndrome)-CAUSES->(Disease)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Blood Circulation)\n(Release procedure)-TREATS->(Symptoms)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Menopause)-PROCESS_OF->(Liver)\n(Release procedure)-TREATS->(Symptoms)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(paracrine)-PROCESS_OF->(Liver)\n(Blood Circulation)-PROCESS_OF->(Liver)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Lipids absorbed in the intestine are primarily transported to the liver by chylomicrons. Chylomicrons are formed in the intestinal cells after dietary fats are processed and are released into the lymphatic system before entering the bloodstream. They play a crucial role in transporting dietary lipids, including triglycerides, to various tissues, including the liver. The reasoning chains consistently support this process, confirming that chylomicrons are the main carriers of lipids from the intestine to the liver. Other lipoproteins like VLDL, HDL, and LDL are involved in lipid transport but are not responsible for the initial transfer of dietary lipids from the intestine to the liver.\"\n}",
