      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Physiology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Vitamin B12 intrinsic factor absorption occurs in\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Duodenum\nopb. Ileum\nopc. Jejunum\nopd. Colon\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Vitamin B12\" -> \"requires intrinsic factor for absorption\" -> \"intrinsic factor binds to B12\" -> \"absorption occurs in the ileum\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Intrinsic factor\" -> \"produced in the stomach\" -> \"binds to vitamin B12\" -> \"complex travels to the ileum\" -> \"absorption occurs in the ileum\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Vitamin B12 absorption\" -> \"depends on intrinsic factor\" -> \"intrinsic factor-B12 complex\" -> \"absorbed in the ileum\" -> 92%\nCHAIN: \"Vitamin B12\" -> \"intrinsic factor necessary for absorption\" -> \"transported to the ileum\" -> \"ileum is the site of absorption\" -> 93%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Vitamin B 12)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Pathogenesis)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Intrinsic factor)\n(Vitamin B 12)-PREVENTS->(Inflammation)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Intrinsic factor)\n(Intrinsic factor)-INTERACTS_WITH->(T-Lymphocyte)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Genes)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Vitamin B 12)\n(Intrinsic factor)-INTERACTS_WITH->(T-Lymphocyte)-PART_OF->(Bone Marrow)-LOCATION_OF->(Vitamin B 12)\n(Intrinsic factor)-CAUSES->(Immunity)-PROCESS_OF->(ileum)\n(Intrinsic factor)-CAUSES->(uptake)-PROCESS_OF->(ileum)\n(Vitamin B 12)-TREATS->(Disease)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Respiration)-PROCESS_OF->(ileum)\n(Vitamin B 12)-PREVENTS->(Disease)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Physiologic Function)-PROCESS_OF->(ileum)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Vitamin B12 absorption requires intrinsic factor, which is produced in the stomach and binds to vitamin B12 to form a complex. This complex is then transported to the ileum, where absorption occurs. All reasoning chains correctly identify the ileum as the site of absorption for the intrinsic factor-B12 complex, aligning with medical consensus. Evidence paths supporting the role of intrinsic factor in the uptake process in the ileum further confirm this. Therefore, the correct answer is that vitamin B12 intrinsic factor absorption occurs in the ileum.\"\n}",
