      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Physiology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Progesterone production in the ovary is primarily by:\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Stroma\nopb. Corpora albicans\nopc. Corpora lutea\nopd. Mature follicles\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Progesterone is a hormone\" -> \"produced primarily in the ovaries\" -> \"mainly by the corpus luteum\" -> \"corpus luteum is formed after ovulation\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Ovarian follicles develop during the menstrual cycle\" -> \"mature follicles release an egg\" -> \"after ovulation, the follicle transforms into the corpus luteum\" -> \"corpus luteum produces progesterone\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Stroma is supportive tissue in the ovary\" -> \"does not primarily produce hormones\" -> \"progesterone is mainly produced by the corpus luteum\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Corpora albicans is a degenerated form of the corpus luteum\" -> \"does not produce significant amounts of progesterone\" -> \"progesterone is primarily produced by the corpus luteum\" -> 80%\nCHAIN: \"Mature follicles are involved in ovulation\" -> \"they do not produce progesterone\" -> \"progesterone is produced by the corpus luteum\" -> 90%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Structure of corpus luteum of ovary)-LOCATION_OF->(Progesterone)\n(Progesterone)-CAUSES->(uptake)-PROCESS_OF->(Structure of corpus luteum of ovary)\n(Progesterone)-CAUSES->(Ovarian Cycle)-PROCESS_OF->(Ovary)\n(Progesterone)-CAUSES->(paracrine)-PROCESS_OF->(Ovary)\n(Progesterone)-CAUSES->(Physiologic Function)-PROCESS_OF->(Ovary)\n(Hair follicle structure)-LOCATION_OF->(Estradiol)-PART_OF->(Structure of corpus luteum of ovary)\n(Ovarian Follicle)-LOCATION_OF->(Estradiol)-PART_OF->(Hair follicle structure)\n(Hormones)-CAUSES->(Disease)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(physiological aspects)-PROCESS_OF->(Structure of corpus luteum of ovary)\n(Hormones)-CAUSES->(Disease)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(uptake)-PROCESS_OF->(Structure of corpus luteum of ovary)\n(Hormones)-CAUSES->(Obesity)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(physiological aspects)-PROCESS_OF->(Structure of corpus luteum of ovary)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Progesterone is primarily produced in the ovaries by the corpus luteum, which forms after ovulation from the mature follicle. The stroma of the ovary serves as supportive tissue and does not primarily produce hormones. The corpora albicans is a degenerated form of the corpus luteum and does not produce significant amounts of progesterone. Mature follicles are involved in ovulation but do not produce progesterone; this function is taken over by the corpus luteum post-ovulation. Therefore, the correct answer is that progesterone production in the ovary is primarily by the corpus lutea.\"\n}",
