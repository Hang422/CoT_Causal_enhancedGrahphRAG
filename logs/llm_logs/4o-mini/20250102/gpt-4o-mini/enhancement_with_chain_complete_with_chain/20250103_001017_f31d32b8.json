      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Biochemistry.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Hypermagnesemia may be observed in:\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Hyperparathyroidism\nopb. Diabetes mellitus\nopc. Kwashiorkor\nopd. Primary aldosteronism\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Hyperparathyroidism\" -> \"increased bone resorption\" -> \"release of magnesium from bones\" -> \"elevated serum magnesium levels\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Diabetes mellitus\" -> \"possible renal impairment\" -> \"decreased magnesium excretion\" -> \"potential for hypermagnesemia\" -> 70%\nCHAIN: \"Kwashiorkor\" -> \"malnutrition\" -> \"possible electrolyte imbalances\" -> \"unclear relationship with magnesium levels\" -> 50%\nCHAIN: \"Primary aldosteronism\" -> \"increased aldosterone secretion\" -> \"increased renal excretion of magnesium\" -> \"decreased serum magnesium levels\" -> 90%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Diabetes Mellitus)-CAUSES->(Renal Insufficiency)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Hypermagnesemia is characterized by elevated serum magnesium levels. The reasoning for each option is as follows: \\n\\n1. **Hyperparathyroidism**: This condition leads to increased bone resorption, which can release magnesium from bones, potentially resulting in elevated serum magnesium levels. This aligns with consensus, thus supporting the possibility of hypermagnesemia in this condition. \\n\\n2. **Diabetes mellitus**: While diabetes can lead to renal impairment, which may decrease magnesium excretion, the direct link to hypermagnesemia is less clear. The evidence path regarding renal insufficiency is relevant but does not definitively support hypermagnesemia as a common outcome. Therefore, this option is less likely to be correct. \\n\\n3. **Kwashiorkor**: This condition is associated with malnutrition and various electrolyte imbalances, but the relationship with magnesium levels is unclear and not well-established in the literature. Thus, this option does not support hypermagnesemia. \\n\\n4. **Primary aldosteronism**: This condition is characterized by increased aldosterone secretion, which typically leads to increased renal excretion of magnesium, resulting in decreased serum magnesium levels. This contradicts the possibility of hypermagnesemia. \\n\\nIn summary, hypermagnesemia may be observed in hyperparathyroidism, while diabetes mellitus, kwashiorkor, and primary aldosteronism are less likely to be associated with elevated magnesium levels.\"\n}",
