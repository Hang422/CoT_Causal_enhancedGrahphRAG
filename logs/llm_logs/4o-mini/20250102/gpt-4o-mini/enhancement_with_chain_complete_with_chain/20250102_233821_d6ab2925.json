      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Drug the choice for hyperthyroidism in first trimester of pregnancy is\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Methimazole\nopb. Propylthiouraril\nopc. Carbimazole\nopd. Perchlorate\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Hyperthyroidism treatment in pregnancy\" -> \"First trimester is critical for fetal development\" -> \"Certain drugs are safer than others\" -> \"Propylthiouracil is preferred in early pregnancy\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Hyperthyroidism management options\" -> \"Methimazole is associated with teratogenic effects\" -> \"Carbimazole is a pro-drug of Methimazole\" -> \"Perchlorate is not commonly used\" -> \"Propylthiouracil is the safest choice\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"First trimester hyperthyroidism treatment\" -> \"Risk of fetal harm must be minimized\" -> \"Propylthiouracil has a better safety profile\" -> \"Other options are less favorable\" -> \"Propylthiouracil is the drug of choice\" -> 92%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Hyperthyroidism)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Pathogenesis)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Enzymes)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Methimazole)\n(Hyperthyroidism)-PREDISPOSES->(Complication)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(TPO gene|TPO)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Methimazole)\n(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Corticosterone)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Propylthiouracil)\n(Teratogenesis)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Genes)-INTERACTS_WITH->(CYP2B6)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Methimazole)\n(Teratogenesis)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Genes)-INTERACTS_WITH->(TBX1)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Methimazole)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"In the management of hyperthyroidism during the first trimester of pregnancy, Propylthiouracil (PTU) is the preferred choice due to its better safety profile compared to Methimazole, which is associated with teratogenic effects. Methimazole is a pro-drug of Carbimazole, and both are less favorable in early pregnancy due to potential risks to fetal development. Perchlorate is not commonly used in this context. The consensus supports the use of Propylthiouracil as the safest option for treating hyperthyroidism in pregnant patients during the first trimester.\"\n}",
