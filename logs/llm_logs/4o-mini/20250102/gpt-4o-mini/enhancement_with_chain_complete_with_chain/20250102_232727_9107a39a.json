      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        In a CA lung patient is suffering from dyspnoea, the palliation of dyspnoea is achieved by\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Morphine patch\nopb. Diazepam\nopc. Clobazam\nopd. Haloperidol\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Morphine patch\" -> \"decreased perception of breathlessness\" -> \"reduced dyspnoea\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Diazepam\" -> \"anxiolytic effect\" -> \"reduced anxiety related to dyspnoea\" -> \"possible improvement in comfort\" -> 70%\nCHAIN: \"Clobazam\" -> \"anxiolytic effect\" -> \"reduced anxiety\" -> \"possible improvement in dyspnoea\" -> 65%\nCHAIN: \"Haloperidol\" -> \"antipsychotic effect\" -> \"possible reduction in anxiety\" -> \"unclear impact on dyspnoea\" -> 60%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Morphine)-PREVENTS->(Dyspnea)\n(Anxiety)-CAUSES->(Disease)-CAUSES->(Dyspnea)\n(Anxiety)-CAUSES->(Obesity)-CAUSES->(Dyspnea)\n(Anxiety)-CAUSES->(Hypertensive disease)-CAUSES->(Dyspnea)\n(Diazepam)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(HCRTR2 gene|HCRTR2)-CAUSES->(Anti-Anxiety Effect)\n(Diazepam)-ISA->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(agonists)-CAUSES->(Anti-Anxiety Effect)\n(clobazam)-TREATS->(Adverse effects)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(pregabalin)-CAUSES->(Anti-Anxiety Effect)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"In palliative care for lung cancer patients experiencing dyspnoea, the use of a morphine patch is well-supported by consensus as it effectively decreases the perception of breathlessness, leading to reduced dyspnoea. This aligns with evidence indicating that morphine can prevent dyspnoea. Diazepam and clobazam may provide some relief through their anxiolytic effects, potentially improving comfort related to anxiety, but their direct impact on dyspnoea is less established, with diazepam showing a possible improvement in comfort but not specifically targeting dyspnoea. Haloperidol, while it may reduce anxiety, has an unclear impact on dyspnoea and is not typically used for this purpose. Therefore, the most effective option for palliation of dyspnoea in this context is the morphine patch.\"\n}",
