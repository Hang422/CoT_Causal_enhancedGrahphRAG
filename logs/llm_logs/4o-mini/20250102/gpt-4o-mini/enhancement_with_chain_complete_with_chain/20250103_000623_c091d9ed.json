      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Physiology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Major hormone secreted by zona reticularis of adrenal coex ?\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Glucocoicoids\nopb. Mineralcoicoids\nopc. Aldosterone\nopd. Androgens\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Zona reticularis of adrenal cortex\" -> \"produces sex hormones\" -> \"mainly androgens\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Adrenal cortex\" -> \"divided into three zones\" -> \"zona reticularis is the innermost\" -> \"secretes androgens\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Zona reticularis\" -> \"responsible for hormone production\" -> \"primarily produces androgens\" -> \"such as dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA)\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Adrenal cortex\" -> \"zona glomerulosa produces mineralocorticoids\" -> \"zona fasciculata produces glucocorticoids\" -> \"zona reticularis produces androgens\" -> 90%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Zona Reticularis)-LOCATION_OF->(Androgens)-ISA->(Hormones)\n(Gonadal Steroid Hormones)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Androgens)\n(Zona Reticularis)-LOCATION_OF->(Androgens)\n(Zona Reticularis)-LOCATION_OF->(Corticosterone)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Gonadal Steroid Hormones)\n(Zona Reticularis)-LOCATION_OF->(dehydroepiandrosterone)-ISA->(Gonadal Steroid Hormones)\n(Zona Fasciculata)-LOCATION_OF->(Corticosterone)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Androgens)\n(Zona Fasciculata)-LOCATION_OF->(Lipids)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Androgens)\n(Hormones)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Androgens)\n(Androgens)-INTERACTS_WITH->(dehydroepiandrosterone)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"The zona reticularis of the adrenal cortex primarily produces androgens, which are a class of sex hormones. This is supported by the consensus that the adrenal cortex is divided into three zones: the zona glomerulosa (producing mineralocorticoids), the zona fasciculata (producing glucocorticoids), and the zona reticularis (producing androgens). Key androgens produced include dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA). Therefore, the correct answer to the question regarding the major hormone secreted by the zona reticularis is androgens.\"\n}",
