      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Which of the following drugs should be given in a patient with acute angle closure glaucoma .except\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Pilocarpine\nopb. Clozapine\nopc. Fluphenazine\nopd. Paroxentine\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Acute angle closure glaucoma\" -> \"requires rapid reduction of intraocular pressure\" -> \"Pilocarpine is a miotic agent\" -> \"increases aqueous humor outflow\" -> \"effective in lowering intraocular pressure\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Acute angle closure glaucoma\" -> \"requires rapid intervention\" -> \"Clozapine is an antipsychotic\" -> \"not indicated for glaucoma treatment\" -> \"does not address intraocular pressure\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Acute angle closure glaucoma\" -> \"requires medications to lower intraocular pressure\" -> \"Fluphenazine is an antipsychotic\" -> \"not indicated for glaucoma treatment\" -> \"does not lower intraocular pressure\" -> 80%\nCHAIN: \"Acute angle closure glaucoma\" -> \"requires medications to lower intraocular pressure\" -> \"Paroxetine is an SSRI\" -> \"not indicated for glaucoma treatment\" -> \"does not lower intraocular pressure\" -> 80%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Clozapine)-INTERACTS_WITH/ISA->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Anti glaucoma agent)\n(Acute angle-closure glaucoma)-closure glaucoma)->(Disease)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Virus)-LOCATION_OF->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)\n(Acute angle-closure glaucoma)-closure glaucoma)->(HIV)-ISA->(Virus)-LOCATION_OF->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)\n(Fluphenazine)-PART_OF->(Retina)-LOCATION_OF->(Anti glaucoma agent)\n(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(CYP2D6 gene|CYP2D6)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Paroxetine)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"In acute angle closure glaucoma, rapid reduction of intraocular pressure is critical. Pilocarpine, a miotic agent, effectively increases aqueous humor outflow and is indicated for this condition. In contrast, Clozapine, Fluphenazine, and Paroxetine are not indicated for glaucoma treatment as they do not lower intraocular pressure. Clozapine and Fluphenazine are antipsychotics, while Paroxetine is an SSRI, all of which lack efficacy in managing intraocular pressure. Therefore, the drugs that should not be given in this scenario include Clozapine, Fluphenazine, and Paroxetine.\"\n}",
