      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Pilocarpine reduce the intraocular pressure in persons with closed angle glaucoma by:\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Reducing aqueous humor secretion\nopb. Contracting iris sphincter muscle\nopc. Increasing aqueous humor outflow\nopd. Relaxing ciliary muscle\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Pilocarpine\" -> \"stimulates muscarinic receptors\" -> \"contracts iris sphincter muscle\" -> \"opens the angle of the anterior chamber\" -> \"increases aqueous humor outflow\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Pilocarpine\" -> \"increases ciliary muscle contraction\" -> \"facilitates aqueous humor drainage\" -> \"reduces intraocular pressure\" -> 80%\nCHAIN: \"Pilocarpine\" -> \"induces miosis\" -> \"reduces pupillary block\" -> \"enhances aqueous humor outflow\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Pilocarpine\" -> \"causes contraction of the iris sphincter\" -> \"widens the drainage angle\" -> \"increases aqueous humor outflow\" -> 75%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Pilocarpine)-CAUSES->(Epilepsy)-PREDISPOSES->(Contraction)\n(Pilocarpine)-TREATS->(Hypertensive disease)-CAUSES->(Contraction)\n(Pilocarpine)-TREATS->(Presbyopia)-CAUSES->(Contraction)\n(Pilocarpine)-TREATS->(Disease)-CAUSES->(Ocular-Ophthalmoplegia, Sympathetic)-CAUSES->(Miosis disorder)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Pilocarpine reduces intraocular pressure in closed angle glaucoma primarily by contracting the iris sphincter muscle, which induces miosis and opens the angle of the anterior chamber. This action facilitates increased aqueous humor outflow, thereby lowering intraocular pressure. The reasoning chains confirm that pilocarpine's stimulation of muscarinic receptors leads to contraction of the ciliary muscle, enhancing aqueous humor drainage. The evidence paths related to contraction and miosis support the understanding of pilocarpine's mechanism in treating glaucoma, while irrelevant paths regarding epilepsy and presbyopia do not contribute to this specific context.\"\n}",
