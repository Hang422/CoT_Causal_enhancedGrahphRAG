      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        A person on anti-tubercular drugs complained of deafness and tinnitus in one ear. Drug implicated is?\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Streptomycin\nopb. Isoniazid\nopc. Ethambutol\nopd. Rifampicin\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Anti-tubercular drugs\" -> \"possible side effects\" -> \"ototoxicity\" -> \"deafness and tinnitus\" -> \"Streptomycin\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Anti-tubercular drugs\" -> \"Isoniazid\" -> \"neuropathy\" -> \"not typically associated with deafness\" -> \"unlikely\" -> 70%\nCHAIN: \"Anti-tubercular drugs\" -> \"Ethambutol\" -> \"visual disturbances\" -> \"not associated with hearing loss\" -> \"unlikely\" -> 75%\nCHAIN: \"Anti-tubercular drugs\" -> \"Rifampicin\" -> \"hepatotoxicity\" -> \"not associated with deafness\" -> \"unlikely\" -> 70%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Deafness)-COMPLICATES/PREDISPOSES->(Disease)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Virus)-LOCATION_OF->(Streptomycin)\n(Ethambutol)-CAUSES->(Disorder of the optic nerve)-CAUSES->(Visual alteration)\n(Tinnitus)-MANIFESTATION_OF/PREDISPOSES->(Disease)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Virus)-LOCATION_OF->(Streptomycin)\n(isoniazid)-TREATS->(Neuropathy)\n(Ethambutol)-TREATS->(Disease)-CAUSES->(Visual alteration)\n(Ethambutol)-TREATS->(Infection)-CAUSES->(Visual alteration)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Streptomycin is an anti-tubercular drug known for its potential ototoxicity, which can lead to side effects such as deafness and tinnitus. The reasoning chain for Streptomycin is supported by consensus, as it is well-documented that this drug can cause these auditory complications. In contrast, Isoniazid is primarily associated with peripheral neuropathy and is not typically linked to hearing loss, making it unlikely to be the cause in this case. Ethambutol is known for causing visual disturbances rather than auditory issues, and Rifampicin is associated with hepatotoxicity but not with deafness. Therefore, the most likely drug implicated in the patient's symptoms of deafness and tinnitus is Streptomycin.\"\n}",
