Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        The placenta secretes a hormone that is utilized in the early detection of pregnancy. This hormone is:\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Endothelial growth factor (EGF)\nopb. Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG)\nopc. Human chorionic somatotropin (HCS)\nopd. Relaxin\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Placenta secretes hormones\" -> \"hCG is one of the hormones secreted\" -> \"hCG is detected in urine tests\" -> \"hCG indicates early pregnancy\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Placenta produces various hormones\" -> \"hCG is specifically produced during pregnancy\" -> \"hCG levels rise in early pregnancy\" -> \"hCG is used for pregnancy tests\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Hormones secreted by the placenta\" -> \"hCG is a key hormone for pregnancy detection\" -> \"hCG is detected by pregnancy tests\" -> \"positive test indicates pregnancy\" -> 92%\nCHAIN: \"Pregnancy involves hormonal changes\" -> \"hCG is secreted by the placenta\" -> \"hCG is used in early pregnancy detection\" -> \"hCG presence confirms pregnancy\" -> 93%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Hormones)-PART_OF->(Cells)-INTERACTS_WITH/LOCATION_OF->(Human Chorionic Gonadotropin)\n(Human Chorionic Gonadotropin)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cells)-PART_OF->(Endometrium)-LOCATION_OF->(Pregnancy Tests)\n(Human Chorionic Gonadotropin)-PART_OF->(Cells)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Melanophores)-LOCATION_OF->(Pregnancy Tests)\n(Human Chorionic Gonadotropin)-CAUSES->(Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome)-COMPLICATES->(early pregnancy)\n(Human Chorionic Gonadotropin)-TREATS->(Disease)-CAUSES->(early pregnancy)\n(Human Chorionic Gonadotropin)-TREATS->(Pre-Eclampsia)-Eclampsia)->(early pregnancy)\n(Human Chorionic Gonadotropin)-PART_OF->(Tumor tissue sample)-LOCATION_OF->(Detection)\n(Hormones)-PART_OF->(Endometrium)-LOCATION_OF->(Pregnancy Tests)\n(Hormones)-PART_OF->(Uterus)-LOCATION_OF->(Pregnancy Tests)\n(Human Chorionic Gonadotropin)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cells)-PART_OF->(Renal Tissue)-LOCATION_OF->(Urinalysis)\n(Human Chorionic Gonadotropin)-PART_OF->(Cells)-PART_OF->(Extracellular Matrix)-LOCATION_OF->(Urinalysis)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"The placenta secretes several hormones during pregnancy, with human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) being the primary hormone utilized for early pregnancy detection. hCG is specifically produced by the placenta shortly after implantation and its levels rise significantly in early pregnancy. This hormone is detected in urine tests, which confirm pregnancy. The reasoning chains consistently highlight that hCG is the key hormone for pregnancy detection, supported by evidence showing its interaction with renal tissue during urinalysis and its presence in pregnancy tests. Other options, such as endothelial growth factor (EGF), human chorionic somatotropin (HCS), and relaxin, do not play a role in early pregnancy detection. Therefore, the correct answer is human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG).\"\n}",
