      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Biochemistry.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        SACD (Subacute combined degeneration of cord) is feature of which vitamin deficiency?\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Vitamin A\nopb. Vitamin B6\nopc. Vitamin B9\nopd. Vitamin B12\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"SACD is a neurological condition\" -> \"associated with myelin degeneration\" -> \"myelin degeneration linked to vitamin deficiencies\" -> \"Vitamin B12 deficiency known to cause myelin degeneration\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"SACD presents with specific neurological symptoms\" -> \"neurological symptoms often due to vitamin deficiencies\" -> \"Vitamin B12 deficiency commonly causes neurological symptoms\" -> \"Vitamin B12 is crucial for myelin synthesis\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Subacute combined degeneration of the cord\" -> \"characterized by degeneration of the dorsal columns and corticospinal tracts\" -> \"dorsal columns and corticospinal tracts affected by vitamin deficiencies\" -> \"Vitamin B12 deficiency specifically affects these tracts\" -> 92%\nCHAIN: \"Vitamin A deficiency\" -> \"not typically associated with neurological degeneration\" -> \"Vitamin B6 deficiency\" -> \"not primarily linked to myelin degeneration\" -> \"Vitamin B9 deficiency\" -> \"not associated with SACD\" -> \"leaving Vitamin B12 as the primary cause\" -> 88%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Neurologic Symptoms)-CAUSES->(Disease)-CAUSES->(Vitamin A Deficiency)\n(Primary demyelination)-CAUSES->(Neurodegenerative Disorders)-CAUSES->(Disease)-CAUSES->(Vitamin A Deficiency)\n(Primary demyelination)-CAUSES->(Multiple System Atrophy)-CAUSES->(Disease)-CAUSES->(Vitamin A Deficiency)\n(Primary demyelination)-CAUSES->(Peripheral Neuropathy)-CAUSES->(Disease)-CAUSES->(Vitamin A Deficiency)\n(Primary demyelination)-CAUSES->(Neurodegenerative Disorders)-CAUSES->(Disease)-CAUSES->(Folic Acid Deficiency)\n(Primary demyelination)-CAUSES->(Multiple System Atrophy)-CAUSES->(Disease)-CAUSES->(Folic Acid Deficiency)\n(Primary demyelination)-CAUSES->(Peripheral Neuropathy)-CAUSES->(Disease)-CAUSES->(Folic Acid Deficiency)\n(Corticospinal Tracts)-PART_OF->(Column)-LOCATION_OF->(Fatty Acids, Unsaturated)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Vitamin B 12)\n(Corticospinal Tracts)-PART_OF->(Column)-PART_OF->(Liver)-LOCATION_OF->(Vitamin B 12)\n(Dorsal funiculus)-PART_OF->(Column)-LOCATION_OF->(Fatty Acids, Unsaturated)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Vitamin B 12)\n(Dorsal funiculus)-PART_OF->(Column)-PART_OF->(Liver)-LOCATION_OF->(Vitamin B 12)\n(Vitamin A Deficiency)-PREDISPOSES->(Pathogenesis)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(APP gene)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Vitamin B 12)\n(Vitamin A Deficiency)-PREDISPOSES->(Pathogenesis)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Alleles)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Vitamin B 12)\n(Neurologic Symptoms)-CAUSES->(Symptoms)-CAUSES->(Vitamin A Deficiency)\n(Neurologic Symptoms)-CAUSES->(Blind Vision)-CAUSES->(Vitamin A Deficiency)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Subacute combined degeneration of the cord (SACD) is primarily associated with Vitamin B12 deficiency. The reasoning chains confirm that SACD is a neurological condition characterized by myelin degeneration, particularly affecting the dorsal columns and corticospinal tracts, which are known to be impacted by Vitamin B12 deficiency. Other vitamin deficiencies, such as Vitamin A, B6, and B9, do not typically lead to SACD or significant myelin degeneration. Therefore, the consensus supports that Vitamin B12 is the key vitamin deficiency linked to SACD.\"\n}",
