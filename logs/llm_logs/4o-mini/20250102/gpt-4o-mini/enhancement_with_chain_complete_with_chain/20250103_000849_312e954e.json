      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Drug of choice in pneumonia caused by P. carinii is :\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Penicillin\nopb. Cotrimoxazole\nopc. Kanamycin\nopd. Levofloxacin\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Pneumonia caused by P. carinii\" -> \"commonly associated with immunocompromised patients\" -> \"treatment typically involves specific antibiotics\" -> \"Cotrimoxazole is effective against P. carinii\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Pneumonia caused by P. carinii\" -> \"often seen in patients with HIV/AIDS\" -> \"standard treatment guidelines recommend Cotrimoxazole\" -> \"other options are less effective\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Pneumonia caused by P. carinii\" -> \"requires targeted antibiotic therapy\" -> \"Cotrimoxazole is the first-line treatment\" -> \"other antibiotics like Penicillin are not effective\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Pneumonia caused by P. carinii\" -> \"not typically treated with Levofloxacin\" -> \"Cotrimoxazole is the preferred choice\" -> \"Kanamycin is not indicated\" -> 80%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Levofloxacin)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(BMP1|PRCP|PGPEP1)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole Combination)\n(Levofloxacin)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole Combination)\n(Trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole Combination)-TREATS->(Staphylococcus aureus)-LOCATION_OF->(Kanamycin)\n(Trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole Combination)-TREATS->(Campylobacter)-LOCATION_OF->(Kanamycin)\n(Pneumonia)-ISA/MANIFESTATION_OF->(Infection)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Bactericidal activity)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Levofloxacin)\n(Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome)-CAUSES/PREDISPOSES->(Pathogenesis)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Genes)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole Combination)-Sulfamethoxazole Combination)\n(Treated with)-TREATS->(Atherosclerosis)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Genes)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole Combination)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "
