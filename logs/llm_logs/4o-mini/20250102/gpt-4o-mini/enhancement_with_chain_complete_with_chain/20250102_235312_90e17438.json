      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Aspirin is contraindicated in?\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Fever\nopb. Peptic ulcer\nopc. Unstable angina\nopd. Myalgia\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Aspirin\" -> \"inhibits platelet aggregation\" -> \"increased risk of bleeding\" -> \"contraindicated in peptic ulcer\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Aspirin\" -> \"reduces inflammation\" -> \"may be used in myalgia\" -> \"not contraindicated\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Aspirin\" -> \"can cause gastrointestinal irritation\" -> \"may worsen peptic ulcer\" -> \"contraindicated in peptic ulcer\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Aspirin\" -> \"used for cardiovascular protection\" -> \"beneficial in unstable angina\" -> \"not contraindicated\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Aspirin\" -> \"can cause Reye's syndrome in children\" -> \"contraindicated in fever in children\" -> \"possible contraindication\" -> 70%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Aspirin)-TREATS->(Reye Syndrome)\n(Aspirin)-PREVENTS->(Disease)-CAUSES->(Chloasma)-CAUSES->(Gastrointestinal irritation)\n(Aspirin)-PREVENTS->(Adverse effects)-CAUSES->(Chloasma)-CAUSES->(Gastrointestinal irritation)\n(Aspirin)-TREATS->(Dermo-)-CAUSES->(Chloasma)-CAUSES->(Gastrointestinal irritation)\n(Aspirin)-PREDISPOSES->(Inflammation)\n(Reye Syndrome)-CAUSES->(hypoglycemia)-CAUSES->(Fever)\n(Reye Syndrome)-COMPLICATES->(Virus Diseases)-CAUSES->(Fever)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Aspirin is contraindicated in peptic ulcer due to its potential to cause gastrointestinal irritation and increase the risk of bleeding, which can exacerbate ulcer conditions. In unstable angina, aspirin is beneficial as it provides cardiovascular protection and is not contraindicated. Myalgia is not a contraindication for aspirin, as it can be used to reduce inflammation. Regarding fever, while aspirin can cause Reye's syndrome in children, it is not universally contraindicated in fever for adults; however, caution is advised in pediatric cases. Therefore, the strongest contraindication for aspirin is in peptic ulcer.\"\n}",
