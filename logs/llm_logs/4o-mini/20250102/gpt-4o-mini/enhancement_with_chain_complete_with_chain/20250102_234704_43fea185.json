      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        All of the following are true about Nizatidine except\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. It is a H2 blocker used in peptic ulcer disease\nopb. It has 100% Bioavailability\nopc. It also enhances gastric emptying\nopd. It can also lead to tachycardia\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Nizatidine is an H2 blocker\" -> \"used in peptic ulcer disease\" -> \"reduces gastric acid secretion\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Nizatidine has high bioavailability\" -> \"but not -> 100%\nCHAIN: \"Nizatidine does not enhance gastric emptying\" -> \"it primarily reduces acid secretion\" -> \"no evidence of enhancing gastric motility\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Nizatidine can cause side effects\" -> \"but tachycardia is not commonly associated\" -> \"more common side effects include headache and dizziness\" -> 80%\nCHAIN: \"Nizatidine is an H2 blocker\" -> \"it is effective for peptic ulcer disease\" -> \"but does not enhance gastric emptying\" -> \"therefore, option c is false\" -> 90%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Nizatidine)-TREATS->(Disease)-CAUSES->(Tachycardia)\n(Nizatidine)-TREATS->(Heart failure)-CAUSES->(Tachycardia)\n(Nizatidine)-TREATS->(Peptic Ulcer)\n(Nizatidine)-PREVENTS->(Symptoms)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Tachycardia)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Nizatidine is indeed an H2 blocker used in the treatment of peptic ulcer disease, as it effectively reduces gastric acid secretion. However, it does not have 100% bioavailability; its bioavailability is approximately 70%. Nizatidine does not enhance gastric emptying; its primary action is to reduce acid secretion, and there is no evidence supporting any effect on gastric motility. While Nizatidine can cause side effects, tachycardia is not commonly associated with its use; more frequent side effects include headache and dizziness. Therefore, the false statement among the options is that Nizatidine enhances gastric emptying.\"\n}",
