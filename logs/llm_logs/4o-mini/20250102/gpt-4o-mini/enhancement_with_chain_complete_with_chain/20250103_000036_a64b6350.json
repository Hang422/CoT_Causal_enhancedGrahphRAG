      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Therapeutic blood range of theophylline in microgram per L is:\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. 0-5\nopb. 10-May\nopc. 15-May\nopd. 20-May\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Theophylline therapeutic range\" -> \"commonly accepted range is 10-20 micrograms per L\" -> \"option opb and opc are plausible\" -> \"opb (10-May) and opc (15-May) are within range\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Theophylline is a bronchodilator\" -> \"therapeutic levels are important for efficacy\" -> \"therapeutic range is typically 10-20 micrograms per L\" -> \"option opd (20-May) is at the upper limit\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Theophylline levels monitored for toxicity\" -> \"therapeutic range is crucial for safety\" -> \"standard therapeutic range is 10-20 micrograms per L\" -> \"options opb (10-May), opc (15-May), and opd (20-May) are valid\" -> 80%\nCHAIN: \"Therapeutic range for theophylline\" -> \"generally accepted as 10-20 micrograms per L\" -> \"option opa (0-5) is too low\" -> \"options opb, opc, and opd are acceptable\" -> 75%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Theophylline)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cells)-INTERACTS_WITH/LOCATION_OF->(Leucine)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"The therapeutic blood range of theophylline is widely accepted to be between 10-20 micrograms per L. This consensus is supported by the need for therapeutic levels to ensure efficacy and safety, as theophylline is a bronchodilator whose levels must be monitored to avoid toxicity. Therefore, options opb (10-May), opc (15-May), and opd (20-May) fall within this therapeutic range, while option opa (0-5) is too low and not acceptable. The evidence paths regarding theophylline's interaction with cells do not directly contribute to clarifying the therapeutic range but confirm its biological relevance.\"\n}",
