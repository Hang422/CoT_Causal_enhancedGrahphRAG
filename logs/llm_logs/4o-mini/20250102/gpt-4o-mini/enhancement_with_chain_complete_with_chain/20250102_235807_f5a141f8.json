      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Physiology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Adrenal insufficiency in not associated with -\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Hyponatremia\nopb. Hyperkalemia\nopc. Hypoglycemia\nopd. Metabolic alkalosis\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Adrenal insufficiency\" -> \"decreased cortisol production\" -> \"increased ACTH levels\" -> \"hyponatremia\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Adrenal insufficiency\" -> \"decreased aldosterone production\" -> \"increased potassium retention\" -> \"hyperkalemia\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Adrenal insufficiency\" -> \"decreased cortisol production\" -> \"impaired gluconeogenesis\" -> \"hypoglycemia\" -> 80%\nCHAIN: \"Adrenal insufficiency\" -> \"decreased aldosterone production\" -> \"sodium loss\" -> \"possible metabolic alkalosis\" -> \"unclear\" -> 60%\nCHAIN: \"Adrenal insufficiency\" -> \"decreased aldosterone production\" -> \"sodium loss\" -> \"not associated with metabolic alkalosis\" -> 75%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Potassium retention)-CAUSES->(hyperkalemia)\n(Corticotropin)-CAUSES->(Disease)-CAUSES->(Hyponatremia)\n(Corticotropin)-TREATS->(Symptoms)-CAUSES->(Hyponatremia)\n(Corticotropin)-TREATS->(Chronic liver disease NOS)-CAUSES->(Hyponatremia)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Adrenal insufficiency is characterized by decreased production of cortisol and aldosterone. This leads to several physiological changes: 1) Hyponatremia occurs due to decreased aldosterone, which normally promotes sodium retention; thus, this option is associated with adrenal insufficiency. 2) Hyperkalemia results from decreased aldosterone, which leads to potassium retention; this option is also associated with adrenal insufficiency. 3) Hypoglycemia can occur due to decreased cortisol, which impairs gluconeogenesis; therefore, this option is associated as well. 4) Metabolic alkalosis is not typically associated with adrenal insufficiency; rather, adrenal insufficiency often leads to metabolic acidosis due to the loss of sodium and retention of potassium. Thus, the correct answer is metabolic alkalosis, as it is not associated with adrenal insufficiency.\"\n}",
