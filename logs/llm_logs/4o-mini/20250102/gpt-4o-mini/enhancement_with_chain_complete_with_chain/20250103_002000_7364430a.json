      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Biochemistry.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Essential amino acids are all except:\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Leucine\nopb. Lysine\nopc. Methionine\nopd. Proline\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Essential amino acids are required for human health\" -> \"Leucine is classified as an essential amino acid\" -> \"Lysine is classified as an essential amino acid\" -> \"Methionine is classified as an essential amino acid\" -> \"Proline is classified as a non-essential amino acid\" -> \"Proline is the exception\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Essential amino acids must be obtained from diet\" -> \"Leucine is necessary for protein synthesis\" -> \"Lysine is necessary for growth and tissue repair\" -> \"Methionine is necessary for metabolism\" -> \"Proline can be synthesized by the body\" -> \"Proline is not essential\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Amino acids are categorized as essential or non-essential\" -> \"Leucine is essential\" -> \"Lysine is essential\" -> \"Methionine is essential\" -> \"Proline is non-essential\" -> \"Proline is the only non-essential in the list\" -> 85%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Amino Acids)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cells)-INTERACTS_WITH/LOCATION_OF->(Leucine)\n(Leucine)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cells)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Lysine)\n(Leucine)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Muscle Fibers)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Lysine)\n(Amino Acids)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cells)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Lysine)\n(Amino Acids)-TREATS->(Herpesvirus 4, Human)-LOCATION_OF->(Lysine)\n(Lysine)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cells)-LOCATION_OF->(Methionine)\n(Lysine)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Normal cell)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Methionine)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Essential amino acids are those that cannot be synthesized by the body and must be obtained through diet. Leucine, Lysine, and Methionine are all classified as essential amino acids, meaning they are required for various physiological functions such as protein synthesis, growth, and metabolism. In contrast, Proline is classified as a non-essential amino acid because the body can synthesize it from other amino acids. Therefore, Proline is the exception among the options listed. This conclusion is supported by the consensus in biochemistry regarding the classification of amino acids.\"\n}",
