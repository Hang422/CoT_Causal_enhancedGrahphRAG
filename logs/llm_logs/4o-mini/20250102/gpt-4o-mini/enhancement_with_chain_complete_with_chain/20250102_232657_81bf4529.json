Patient gives history of recurrent bacterial infections. Ophthalmic examination reveals white triangular plaques on conjunctiva.

Vitamin C\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Diminished vision during night\" -> \"possible night blindness\" -> \"associated with Vitamin A deficiency\" -> \"dryness of eyes indicates possible xerophthalmia\" -> \"white triangular plaques on conjunctiva suggest Bitot's spots\" -> \"consistent with Vitamin A deficiency\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Recurrent bacterial infections\" -> \"possible immune dysfunction\" -> \"Vitamin A is important for immune function\" -> \"deficiency may lead to increased infections\" -> \"supports diagnosis of Vitamin A deficiency\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Dryness of eyes\" -> \"xerophthalmia\" -> \"often caused by Vitamin A deficiency\" -> \"white triangular plaques on conjunctiva\" -> \"Bitot's spots indicate Vitamin A deficiency\" -> 92%\nCHAIN: \"40 year old male patient\" -> \"complains of diminished vision\" -> \"suggests possible deficiency\" -> \"dryness of eyes and recurrent infections\" -> \"Vitamin A is crucial for eye health\" -> \"strongly indicates Vitamin A deficiency\" -> 93%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Night Blindness)-CAUSES->(Blind Vision)-CAUSES->(Vitamin A Deficiency)\n(conjunctiva)-LOCATION_OF->(Vitamin A Deficiency)\n(Night Blindness)-PREDISPOSES->(Deficiency, Vitamin)-CAUSES->(Vitamin A Deficiency)\n(Night Blindness)-CAUSES->(Anemia)-PREDISPOSES->(Vitamin A Deficiency)\n(Eye health)-CAUSES->(Blind Vision)-CAUSES->(Vitamin A Deficiency)\n(Vitamin A Deficiency)-CAUSES->(Disease)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(paracrine)-PROCESS_OF->(Eye)\n(Vitamin A Deficiency)-CAUSES->(Disease)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Hearing)-PROCESS_OF->(Eye)\n(Vitamin A Deficiency)-CAUSES->(Disease)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Neutrophil Infiltration)-PROCESS_OF->(Eye)\n(Vitamin A Deficiency)-CAUSES->(Disease)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(drug clearance)-PROCESS_OF->(conjunctiva)\n(Vitamin A Deficiency)-CAUSES->(Disease)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Immunity)-PROCESS_OF->(conjunctiva)\n(Vitamin A Deficiency)-CAUSES->(Disease)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(physiological aspects)-PROCESS_OF->(conjunctiva)\n(Xerophthalmia)-CAUSES->(Vitamin A Deficiency)\n(Eye health)-PREDISPOSES->(Diabetes)-CAUSES->(Vitamin A Deficiency)\n(Vitamin A)-TREATS->(Vitamin A Deficiency)\n(Eye)-LOCATION_OF->(Vitamin A)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"The patient's symptoms of diminished vision during night (night blindness), dryness of eyes, and recurrent bacterial infections strongly indicate a deficiency in Vitamin A. Night blindness is a classic symptom of Vitamin A deficiency, which is essential for maintaining proper vision, particularly in low-light conditions. The dryness of the eyes suggests xerophthalmia, a condition often caused by Vitamin A deficiency. The presence of white triangular plaques on the conjunctiva, known as Bitot's spots, further supports this diagnosis. Additionally, Vitamin A plays a crucial role in immune function, and its deficiency can lead to increased susceptibility to infections. Therefore, the evidence aligns with a diagnosis of Vitamin A deficiency as the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms.\"\n}",
