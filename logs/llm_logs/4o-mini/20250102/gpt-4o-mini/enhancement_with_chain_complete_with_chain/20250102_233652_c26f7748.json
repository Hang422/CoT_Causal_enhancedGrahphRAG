      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Myoclonus in children is best treated by :\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Clonazepam\nopb. Sodium Valproate\nopc. Phenobarbitone\nopd. Ethosuximide\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Myoclonus in children\" -> \"often associated with epilepsy\" -> \"Clonazepam is effective for myoclonic seizures\" -> \"Clonazepam reduces myoclonic jerks\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Myoclonus in children\" -> \"can be treated with anticonvulsants\" -> \"Sodium Valproate is used for various seizure types\" -> \"Sodium Valproate may help in some myoclonic cases\" -> 75%\nCHAIN: \"Myoclonus in children\" -> \"Phenobarbitone is a barbiturate anticonvulsant\" -> \"less effective for myoclonic seizures\" -> \"not the first-line treatment\" -> 60%\nCHAIN: \"Myoclonus in children\" -> \"Ethosuximide primarily treats absence seizures\" -> \"not typically effective for myoclonus\" -> \"not recommended for myoclonic seizures\" -> 50%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Clonazepam)-TREATS->(Myoclonus)\n(Ethosuximide)-TREATS->(Myoclonus)\n(Myoclonus)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Pathogenesis)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(IMPACT gene)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Phenobarbital)\n(Myoclonus)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Pathogenesis)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(CYP2C9 gene|CYP2C9)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Phenobarbital)\n(Myoclonus)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Pathogenesis)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(CPA1)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Ethosuximide)\n(Phenobarbital)-CAUSES->(Seizures)-CAUSES->(Epilepsies, Myoclonic)\n(Seizures)-CAUSES/MANIFESTATION_OF->(Disease)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(drug clearance)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Sodium Valproate)\n(Anticonvulsants)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Sodium Valproate)\n(Phenobarbital)-TREATS->(Epilepsy)-CAUSES->(Epilepsies, Myoclonic)\n(Phenobarbital)-TREATS->(Epilepsy, Generalized)-PREDISPOSES->(Epilepsies, Myoclonic)\n(Epilepsy)-CAUSES/PREDISPOSES->(Pathogenesis)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Melatonin)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Clonazepam)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Myoclonus in children is often associated with epilepsy and can be effectively treated with certain anticonvulsants. Clonazepam is recognized as an effective treatment for myoclonic seizures, as it reduces myoclonic jerks and is commonly used in clinical practice. Sodium Valproate is also used for various seizure types, including some myoclonic cases, but is not as effective as Clonazepam for this specific condition. Phenobarbital is a barbiturate anticonvulsant that is less effective for myoclonic seizures and is not considered a first-line treatment. Ethosuximide primarily treats absence seizures and is not recommended for myoclonic seizures. Therefore, the best treatment option for myoclonus in children is Clonazepam, supported by its established efficacy in managing myoclonic seizures.\"\n}",
