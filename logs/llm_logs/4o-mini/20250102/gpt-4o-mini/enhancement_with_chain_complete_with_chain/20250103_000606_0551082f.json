      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Biochemistry.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        In all of the following enzyme deficiencies, hyperammonemia is a common feature, EXCEPT:\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Argininosuccinate synthetase\nopb. Carbamoyl Phosphate synthetase (CPS-I)\nopc. Ornithine transcarbamoylase (OTC)\nopd. Ornithine amino transferase\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Argininosuccinate synthetase deficiency\" -> \"impaired conversion of citrulline and aspartate to argininosuccinate\" -> \"increased ammonia levels\" -> \"hyperammonemia\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Carbamoyl Phosphate synthetase (CPS-I) deficiency\" -> \"reduced urea cycle function\" -> \"accumulation of ammonia\" -> \"hyperammonemia\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Ornithine transcarbamoylase (OTC) deficiency\" -> \"disruption of the urea cycle\" -> \"increased ammonia production\" -> \"hyperammonemia\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Ornithine amino transferase deficiency\" -> \"possible alternative metabolic pathway\" -> \"less direct impact on ammonia levels\" -> \"unclear effect on hyperammonemia\" -> 70%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Citrullinemia)-CAUSES->(Hyperammonemia)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Citrulline)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"In the context of enzyme deficiencies leading to hyperammonemia, the following consensus points are relevant: 1) Argininosuccinate synthetase deficiency results in impaired conversion of citrulline and aspartate to argininosuccinate, leading to increased ammonia levels and hyperammonemia. 2) Carbamoyl Phosphate synthetase (CPS-I) deficiency significantly reduces urea cycle function, causing ammonia accumulation and hyperammonemia. 3) Ornithine transcarbamoylase (OTC) deficiency disrupts the urea cycle, resulting in increased ammonia production and hyperammonemia. 4) Ornithine amino transferase deficiency, however, is less directly associated with hyperammonemia as it may involve alternative metabolic pathways that do not lead to significant ammonia accumulation. Therefore, the correct answer to the question is Ornithine amino transferase deficiency, as it is the exception among the listed enzyme deficiencies that typically cause hyperammonemia.\"\n}",
