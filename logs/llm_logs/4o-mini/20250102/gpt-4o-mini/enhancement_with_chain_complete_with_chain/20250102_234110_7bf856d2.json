      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Choose the drug which blocks basal as well as stimulated gastric acid secretion without affecting cholinergic, histaminergic or gastrin receptors\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Loxatidine\nopb. Pirenzepine\nopc. Omeprazole\nopd. Famotidine\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Loxatidine\" -> \"blocks H2 receptors\" -> \"reduces gastric acid secretion\" -> \"does not affect cholinergic, histaminergic, or gastrin receptors\" -> 70%\nCHAIN: \"Pirenzepine\" -> \"blocks M1 muscarinic receptors\" -> \"reduces gastric acid secretion\" -> \"does not block H2 receptors\" -> \"does not meet criteria\" -> 60%\nCHAIN: \"Omeprazole\" -> \"inhibits proton pump\" -> \"blocks stimulated gastric acid secretion\" -> \"does not affect cholinergic, histaminergic, or gastrin receptors\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Famotidine\" -> \"blocks H2 receptors\" -> \"reduces gastric acid secretion\" -> \"does not affect cholinergic, histaminergic, or gastrin receptors\" -> 80%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Pirenzepine)-TREATS->(Chronic liver disease NOS)-CAUSES->(Obstruction)\n(Famotidine)-TREATS->(Chronic liver disease NOS)-CAUSES->(Obstruction)\n(Obstruction)-CAUSES/PREDISPOSES->(Disease)-COMPLICATES->(Insulin Resistance)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Cholecystokinin B Receptor)\n(Pirenzepine)-TREATS->(Disease)-CAUSES->(Obstruction)\n(Pirenzepine)-TREATS->(Gastritis, Hypertrophic)-CAUSES->(Obstruction)\n(Famotidine)-TREATS->(Disease)-CAUSES->(Obstruction)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Loxatidine is an H2 receptor antagonist that reduces gastric acid secretion but does not block cholinergic, histaminergic, or gastrin receptors, making it a potential candidate. However, it primarily blocks H2 receptors, which does not align with the requirement to block both basal and stimulated gastric acid secretion without affecting these receptors. Pirenzepine blocks M1 muscarinic receptors and does not meet the criteria as it does not block H2 receptors. Omeprazole inhibits the proton pump, effectively blocking stimulated gastric acid secretion, and does not affect cholinergic, histaminergic, or gastrin receptors, making it a strong candidate. Famotidine, like Loxatidine, blocks H2 receptors and reduces gastric acid secretion but does not meet the requirement of blocking both basal and stimulated secretion without affecting other receptors. Therefore, the best option is Omeprazole, as it aligns with the criteria of blocking gastric acid secretion without affecting the specified receptors.\"\n}",
