      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Physiology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        The most important action of Secretin is to\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. neutralize the acid from the stomach\nopb. increase secretion of bicarbonates by pancreas\nopc. decrease gastric secretion\nopd. cause contraction of pyloric sphincter\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Secretin release\" -> \"stimulates pancreatic duct cells\" -> \"increased bicarbonate secretion\" -> \"neutralizes gastric acid in the duodenum\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Secretin\" -> \"increases bicarbonate secretion by pancreas\" -> \"neutralizes stomach acid\" -> \"facilitates optimal enzyme function\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Secretin\" -> \"acts on pancreas\" -> \"promotes bicarbonate release\" -> \"increases pH in the small intestine\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Secretin\" -> \"inhibits gastric acid secretion\" -> \"reduces acidity in the stomach\" -> \"promotes digestive enzyme activity\" -> 80%\nCHAIN: \"Secretin\" -> \"causes pancreatic bicarbonate secretion\" -> \"neutralizes gastric acid\" -> \"enhances intestinal digestion\" -> 90%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Secretin)-CAUSES->(fluid secretion)-PROCESS_OF->(Pancreas)\n(Secretin)-CAUSES->(Vasodilation)-PROCESS_OF->(Pancreas)\n(Secretin)-CAUSES->(Excretory function)-PROCESS_OF->(Pancreas)\n(Pancreas)-PART_OF->(Cells)-LOCATION_OF->(Bicarbonates)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Secretin is a hormone primarily responsible for stimulating the pancreas to secrete bicarbonate, which neutralizes gastric acid in the duodenum, facilitating optimal enzyme function for digestion. The most important action of Secretin is thus to increase the secretion of bicarbonates by the pancreas (Option B). While Secretin does have some inhibitory effects on gastric acid secretion, its primary role is in bicarbonate secretion. The evidence paths confirm that Secretin causes fluid secretion in the pancreas, which is essential for bicarbonate release, supporting the consensus that its main action is to enhance bicarbonate secretion.\"\n}",
