      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Physiology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Actions of cholecystokinin include which one of the following?\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Contraction of gall bladder\nopb. Secretion of pancreatic juice rich in enzymes\nopc. Increases the secretion of enterokinase\nopd. All\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Cholecystokinin released\" -> \"stimulates gallbladder contraction\" -> \"bile release into the intestine\" -> \"facilitates fat digestion\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Cholecystokinin released\" -> \"stimulates pancreatic acinar cells\" -> \"secretion of pancreatic juice rich in enzymes\" -> \"enhances digestion of nutrients\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Cholecystokinin released\" -> \"increases secretion of enterokinase\" -> \"activates trypsinogen to trypsin\" -> \"enhances protein digestion\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Cholecystokinin has multiple actions\" -> \"includes gallbladder contraction\" -> \"includes secretion of pancreatic juice\" -> \"includes secretion of enterokinase\" -> \"therefore, all actions are correct\" -> 92%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Cholecystokinin)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cells)-INTERACTS_WITH->(ENTEROPEPTIDASE)\n(Cholecystokinin)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Acinar cell of pancreas)\n(Acinar cell of pancreas)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cells)-LOCATION_OF->(Enzymes)\n(Acinar cell of pancreas)-PART_OF->(Brain)-LOCATION_OF->(Enzymes)\n(ENTEROPEPTIDASE)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cells)-INTERACTS_WITH/LOCATION_OF->(TRYPSIN)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Cholecystokinin (CCK) is a hormone that plays several key roles in digestion. It is known to stimulate gallbladder contraction, leading to the release of bile into the intestine, which aids in fat digestion. Additionally, CCK stimulates pancreatic acinar cells to secrete pancreatic juice rich in digestive enzymes, enhancing nutrient digestion. While CCK is involved in the activation of trypsinogen to trypsin through the action of enteropeptidase (also known as enterokinase), it does not directly increase the secretion of enteropeptidase itself. Therefore, the correct answer is 'All' (option d), as CCK's actions include gallbladder contraction and secretion of pancreatic juice, but the specific role regarding enteropeptidase should be clarified as indirect. The reasoning chains for options a and b are correct, while option c is misleading in implying a direct action of CCK on enteropeptidase secretion.\"\n}",
