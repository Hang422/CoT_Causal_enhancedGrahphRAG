      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Biochemistry.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        All the following are features of Cardiac muscle Except\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Striated\nopb. Large T tubules\nopc. Troponin system present\nopd. Caldesmon is impoant regulatory protein\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Cardiac muscle is striated\" -> \"Striated muscle fibers are characteristic of cardiac muscle\" -> \"Large T tubules are present in cardiac muscle\" -> \"Troponin system is present in cardiac muscle\" -> \"Caldesmon is not a significant regulatory protein in cardiac muscle\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Cardiac muscle has a striated appearance\" -> \"Striated fibers indicate the presence of sarcomeres\" -> \"Large T tubules facilitate calcium entry in cardiac muscle\" -> \"Troponin is involved in cardiac muscle contraction\" -> \"Caldesmon is primarily associated with smooth muscle\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Cardiac muscle is characterized by striations\" -> \"Presence of large T tubules aids in excitation-contraction coupling\" -> \"Troponin is a key component in cardiac muscle contraction\" -> \"Caldesmon is not a major regulatory protein in cardiac muscle\" -> \"Therefore, caldesmon is the exception\" -> 80%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Myocardium)-PART_OF->(Aorta)-LOCATION_OF->(Caldesmon)\n(Myocardium)-LOCATION_OF->(Contraction)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Caldesmon)\n(Myocardium)-LOCATION_OF->(Atrial Fibrillation)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Troponin)\n(Myocardium)-LOCATION_OF->(Left ventricular systolic dysfunction)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Troponin)\n(Regulatory Protein)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cells)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Caldesmon)\n(Regulatory Protein)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Muscle Fibers)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Caldesmon)\n(Troponin)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Muscle Fibers)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Caldesmon)\n(Myofibrils)-PART_OF->(Myocardium)\n(Sarcomeres)-PART_OF->(Myocardium)\n(Myocardium)-LOCATION_OF->(Genes)-PART_OF->(Myofibrils)\n(Myocardium)-LOCATION_OF->(Lipids)-PART_OF->(Myofibrils)\n(Myocardium)-PART_OF->(Biopsy sample)-PART_OF->(brain tissue surgical material)-LOCATION_OF->(Providing presence (regime/therapy))\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Cardiac muscle is characterized by striated fibers, which indicate the presence of sarcomeres, aligning with the consensus that cardiac muscle is striated. It also contains large T tubules that facilitate calcium entry, essential for excitation-contraction coupling. The troponin system is indeed present in cardiac muscle, playing a crucial role in muscle contraction. However, caldesmon is primarily associated with smooth muscle and is not a significant regulatory protein in cardiac muscle. Therefore, the statement that caldesmon is an important regulatory protein in cardiac muscle is incorrect, making it the exception among the options.\"\n}",
