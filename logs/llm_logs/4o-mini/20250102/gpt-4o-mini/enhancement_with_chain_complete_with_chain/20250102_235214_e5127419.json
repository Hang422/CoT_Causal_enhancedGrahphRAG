      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        The patient is being administered i.v. quinine following which he developed restlessness and sweating, the most likely cause is :\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Hypoglycemia\nopb. Cinchonism\nopc. Arrhythmias\nopd. Sweating\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Administration of i.v. quinine\" -> \"possible side effects\" -> \"restlessness and sweating\" -> \"Cinchonism\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Quinine administration\" -> \"increased stimulation of the central nervous system\" -> \"restlessness\" -> \"sweating\" -> \"Cinchonism\" -> 80%\nCHAIN: \"Quinine given intravenously\" -> \"adverse reactions\" -> \"restlessness and sweating\" -> \"possible hypoglycemia\" -> \"unclear\" -> 60%\nCHAIN: \"Quinine infusion\" -> \"cardiovascular effects\" -> \"arrhythmias\" -> \"possible sweating\" -> \"unclear\" -> 55%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Agitation)-CAUSES->(Symptoms)-CAUSES->(hypoglycemia)\n(Quinine)-TREATS->(Disease)-CAUSES->(Adverse reactions)\n(Quinine)-TREATS->(COVID-19)-CAUSES->(Adverse reactions)\n(Quinine)-TREATS->(Syndrome)-CAUSES->(Adverse reactions)\n(Agitation)-CAUSES->(Disease)-CAUSES->(hypoglycemia)\n(Agitation)-PREDISPOSES->(Myocardial Infarction)-CAUSES->(hypoglycemia)\n(Stimulation procedure)-CAUSES->(Disease)-CAUSES->(Agitation)\n(Stimulation procedure)-TREATS->(Symptoms)-CAUSES->(Agitation)\n(Adverse reactions)-CAUSES->(Disease)-CAUSES->(Agitation)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"The administration of i.v. quinine can lead to a condition known as Cinchonism, which is characterized by symptoms such as restlessness, sweating, tinnitus, and headache. The reasoning chains indicate that both restlessness and sweating are common manifestations of Cinchonism, making it the most likely cause in this scenario. While hypoglycemia and arrhythmias are potential concerns with quinine, they are less directly associated with the specific symptoms of restlessness and sweating. Therefore, the best-supported conclusion is that the symptoms are primarily due to Cinchonism, aligning with established pharmacological consensus.\"\n}",
