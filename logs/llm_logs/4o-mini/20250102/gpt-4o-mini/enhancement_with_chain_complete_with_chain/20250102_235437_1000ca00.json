      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Physiology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Shock causes:\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Stagnant hypoxia\nopb. Anemic hypoxia\nopc. Hypoxic hypoxia\nopd. Histotoxic hypoxia\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Shock\" -> \"decreased perfusion to tissues\" -> \"reduced oxygen delivery\" -> \"stagnant hypoxia\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Shock\" -> \"decreased blood volume\" -> \"reduced oxygen-carrying capacity\" -> \"anemic hypoxia\" -> 70%\nCHAIN: \"Shock\" -> \"impaired oxygen utilization\" -> \"inadequate oxygen at cellular level\" -> \"hypoxic hypoxia\" -> 75%\nCHAIN: \"Shock\" -> \"toxic substances in the blood\" -> \"impaired cellular respiration\" -> \"histotoxic hypoxia\" -> 80%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Oxygen)-COMPLICATES->(Hypoxia)\n(Shock)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Corticotropin|POMC)-PART_OF->(Blood)\n(Shock)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(ARSE)-PART_OF->(Blood)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Shock can lead to various types of hypoxia due to decreased perfusion and oxygen delivery to tissues. 1. Stagnant hypoxia occurs when blood flow is reduced, leading to inadequate oxygen supply despite normal oxygen content in the blood. 2. Anemic hypoxia results from a decrease in the oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood, often due to low hemoglobin levels, which can occur in shock due to blood loss. 3. Hypoxic hypoxia is characterized by insufficient oxygen available for cellular metabolism, which can occur in shock due to impaired oxygen delivery. 4. Histotoxic hypoxia arises when cells cannot utilize oxygen effectively, often due to toxins, which can also be a consequence of shock. Each type of hypoxia can be associated with shock, but the most direct effects are seen in stagnant and hypoxic hypoxia due to decreased perfusion and oxygen delivery. The evidence paths confirm the relationship between shock and its impact on blood and oxygen dynamics.\"\n}",
