      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Depression is not a side effect of\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Propanolol\nopb. Oral contraceptives\nopc. Reserpine\nopd. Flupenthixol\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Propranolol\" -> \"commonly used for anxiety\" -> \"not typically associated with depression\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Oral contraceptives\" -> \"hormonal changes can affect mood\" -> \"some may experience depression\" -> \"not a common side effect\" -> 70%\nCHAIN: \"Reserpine\" -> \"known to deplete monoamines\" -> \"associated with depression\" -> \"likely to cause depressive symptoms\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Flupenthixol\" -> \"antipsychotic medication\" -> \"can cause depressive symptoms\" -> \"not uncommon to see depression\" -> 80%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Propranolol)-TREATS->(Anxiety)\n(Mental Depression)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Inflammation)-PREDISPOSES->(Depressive Symptoms)\n(Mental Depression)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Diastasis)-PREDISPOSES->(Depressive Symptoms)\n(Flupenthixol)-INTERACTS_WITH->(MAPT)-INTERACTS_WITH/PART_OF->(Cells)-LOCATION_OF->(Antipsychotic Agents)\n(Anxiety)-CAUSES->(Syndrome)-COMPLICATES->(Mental Depression)\n(Anxiety)-CAUSES->(Cerebral Infarction)-COMPLICATES->(Mental Depression)\n(Anxiety)-CAUSES->(Disease)-PREDISPOSES->(Mental Depression)\n(Mental Depression)-CAUSES->(Obesity)-CAUSES->(Adverse effects)\n(Mental Depression)-CAUSES->(Heart failure)-CAUSES->(Adverse effects)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Propranolol is primarily used for anxiety and is not typically associated with depression, making it the least likely option to cause depressive symptoms. Oral contraceptives can influence mood due to hormonal changes, and while some users may experience depression, it is not a common side effect. Reserpine is known to deplete monoamines, which are crucial for mood regulation, and is associated with causing depressive symptoms. Flupenthixol, an antipsychotic, can also lead to depressive symptoms, making it a potential cause of depression. Therefore, the best-supported conclusion is that depression is not a side effect of Propranolol.\"\n}",
