      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Drug of choice for Treponema Pallidum is?\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Penicillin G\nopb. Tetracycline\nopc. Azithromycin\nopd. Doxycycline\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Treponema Pallidum identified\" -> \"Bacterial infection confirmed\" -> \"Penicillin G is the first-line treatment\" -> \"Effective against Treponema Pallidum\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Treponema Pallidum identified\" -> \"Bacterial infection confirmed\" -> \"Tetracycline is an alternative treatment\" -> \"Less effective than Penicillin G\" -> 70%\nCHAIN: \"Treponema Pallidum identified\" -> \"Bacterial infection confirmed\" -> \"Azithromycin is not first-line\" -> \"Used in penicillin-allergic patients\" -> 60%\nCHAIN: \"Treponema Pallidum identified\" -> \"Bacterial infection confirmed\" -> \"Doxycycline is an alternative treatment\" -> \"Effective but not first-line\" -> 75%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Treponema pallidum)-CAUSES->(Bacterial Infections)\n(First line treatment)-TREATS->(Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome)-PROCESS_OF->(Treponema pallidum)\n(First line treatment)-TREATS->(Syphilis)-PROCESS_OF->(Treponema pallidum)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"The drug of choice for Treponema pallidum, the causative agent of syphilis, is Penicillin G, which is considered the first-line treatment due to its high efficacy. Tetracycline and Doxycycline are alternative treatments but are less effective than Penicillin G. Azithromycin is not a first-line treatment and is typically reserved for patients with penicillin allergies. Therefore, the consensus supports Penicillin G as the most effective and preferred treatment for Treponema pallidum infections.\"\n}",
