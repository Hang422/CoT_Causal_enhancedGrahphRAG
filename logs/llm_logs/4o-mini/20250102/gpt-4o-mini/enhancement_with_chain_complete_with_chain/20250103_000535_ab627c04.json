      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Which is an uricosuric drug-\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Allopurinol\nopb. Probenecid\nopc. Indomethacin\nopd. Aspirin\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Probenecid\" -> \"inhibits renal tubular reabsorption of uric acid\" -> \"increased uric acid excretion\" -> \"uricosuric effect\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Allopurinol\" -> \"inhibits xanthine oxidase\" -> \"decreased uric acid production\" -> \"not a uricosuric drug\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Indomethacin\" -> \"nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug\" -> \"reduces inflammation\" -> \"not a uricosuric drug\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Aspirin\" -> \"low doses inhibit uric acid excretion\" -> \"not a uricosuric drug\" -> 80%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Aspirin)-PREDISPOSES->(Kidney Failure, Chronic)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Excretory function)\n(Aspirin)-PREDISPOSES->(Inflammation)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Excretory function)\n(Aspirin)-TREATS->(Disease)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Excretory function)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Probenecid is a uricosuric drug as it inhibits renal tubular reabsorption of uric acid, leading to increased uric acid excretion. Allopurinol, on the other hand, is not a uricosuric drug; it inhibits xanthine oxidase, reducing uric acid production. Indomethacin is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that does not have a uricosuric effect. Aspirin, particularly at low doses, can inhibit uric acid excretion and is not classified as a uricosuric drug. Therefore, the only uricosuric drug among the options is Probenecid.\"\n}",
