      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Aldosterone action is on :\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Proximal tubule\nopb. Distal tubules\nopc. Loop of Henle\nopd. Collecting duct\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Aldosterone\" -> \"acts on renal tubules\" -> \"increases sodium reabsorption\" -> \"primarily in distal tubules and collecting duct\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Aldosterone\" -> \"regulates electrolyte balance\" -> \"increases potassium excretion\" -> \"primarily in distal tubules and collecting duct\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Aldosterone\" -> \"stimulates sodium-potassium ATPase\" -> \"enhances sodium reabsorption\" -> \"most significant in distal tubules and collecting duct\" -> 92%\nCHAIN: \"Aldosterone\" -> \"influences water retention\" -> \"via sodium reabsorption\" -> \"mainly in distal tubules and collecting duct\" -> 93%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Aldosterone)-CAUSES->(Cytoprotection)-PROCESS_OF->(Renal tubule structure)\n(Aldosterone)-CAUSES->(Excretory function)-PROCESS_OF->(Renal tubule structure)\n(Aldosterone)-CAUSES->(uptake)-PROCESS_OF->(Renal tubule structure)\n(Aldosterone)-CAUSES->(Disease)-CAUSES->(Body fluid retention)\n(Aldosterone)-CAUSES->(Excretory function)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Electrolytes)\n(Aldosterone)-CAUSES->(Immunity)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Electrolytes)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Aldosterone primarily acts on the distal tubules and collecting duct of the nephron. It increases sodium reabsorption and potassium excretion, which are critical for regulating electrolyte balance and fluid retention. The reasoning chains correctly highlight that aldosterone stimulates sodium-potassium ATPase, enhancing sodium reabsorption significantly in these areas. Evidence paths related to aldosterone's role in electrolyte balance and excretory function support this consensus, confirming its primary action in the distal tubules and collecting duct.\"\n}",
