      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Physiology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Seoli cell secrets\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Androgen binding protein\nopb. Testosterone\nopc. LH\nopd. FSH\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Sertoli cells\" -> \"produce androgen binding protein\" -> \"binds testosterone\" -> \"supports spermatogenesis\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Sertoli cells\" -> \"stimulated by FSH\" -> \"promote spermatogenesis\" -> \"influence testosterone levels\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Sertoli cells\" -> \"respond to testosterone\" -> \"support spermatogenesis\" -> \"produce androgen binding protein\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Sertoli cells\" -> \"influence LH secretion\" -> \"affect testosterone production indirectly\" -> \"possible role in feedback loop\" -> 70%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Androgen-Binding Proteins)-Binding Proteins)->(Germ Cells)-INTERACTS_WITH/LOCATION_OF->(Testosterone)\n(Luteinizing Hormone)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Testosterone)\n(Structure of sertoli cell)-INTERACTS_WITH/LOCATION_OF->(Testosterone)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Sertoli cells are crucial for spermatogenesis and secrete androgen binding protein (ABP), which binds testosterone and facilitates its action on germ cells. This aligns with the consensus that Sertoli cells produce ABP to support spermatogenesis. They are stimulated by FSH, which promotes their function and indirectly influences testosterone levels. While Sertoli cells respond to testosterone, they do not secrete it; rather, they support its action. LH primarily stimulates Leydig cells to produce testosterone, not Sertoli cells directly. Therefore, the most accurate option regarding what Sertoli cells secrete is androgen binding protein.\"\n}",
