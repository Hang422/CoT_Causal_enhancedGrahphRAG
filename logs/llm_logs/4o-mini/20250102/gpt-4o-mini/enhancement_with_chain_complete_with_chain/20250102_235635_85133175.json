      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Hyperprolactinemia is a side effect of\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Bromocriptine\nopb. Levodopa\nopc. Amantadine\nopd. Metoclopramide\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Bromocriptine\" -> \"dopamine agonist\" -> \"decreased prolactin secretion\" -> \"not a cause of hyperprolactinemia\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Levodopa\" -> \"dopamine precursor\" -> \"increased dopamine levels\" -> \"possible decrease in prolactin\" -> 80%\nCHAIN: \"Amantadine\" -> \"antiviral and dopaminergic effects\" -> \"possible increase in dopamine\" -> \"unclear effect on prolactin\" -> 70%\nCHAIN: \"Metoclopramide\" -> \"dopamine antagonist\" -> \"increased prolactin secretion\" -> \"causes hyperprolactinemia\" -> 90%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Metoclopramide)-TREATS->(Functional disorder)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(physiological aspects)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Dopamine Antagonists)\n(Metoclopramide)-TREATS->(Epilepsy)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(physiological aspects)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Dopamine Antagonists)\n(Bromocriptine)-ISA->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Dopamine)\n(Dopamine)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Prolactin)\n(Dopamine)-PART_OF->(Cells)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Prolactin)\n(Dopamine Hydrochloride)-TREATS->(Migraine Disorders)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Vasodilation)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Dopamine)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Hyperprolactinemia is primarily caused by dopamine antagonists, which increase prolactin secretion. Metoclopramide is a dopamine antagonist and is well-documented to cause hyperprolactinemia, aligning with the reasoning chain that states it increases prolactin secretion. In contrast, bromocriptine is a dopamine agonist that decreases prolactin levels, thus it does not cause hyperprolactinemia. Levodopa, a dopamine precursor, may decrease prolactin levels, and amantadine's effects on prolactin are unclear but generally do not lead to hyperprolactinemia. Therefore, the only option that directly causes hyperprolactinemia is metoclopramide.\"\n}",
