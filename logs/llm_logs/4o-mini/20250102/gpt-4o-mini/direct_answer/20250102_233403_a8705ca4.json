It does not directly increase the secretion of enterokinase (option opc), which is primarily secreted by the intestinal mucosa. Therefore, the correct actions of CCK are covered by options opa and opb, but not opc. Since opc is not correct, the answer cannot be 'All'.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opd\",\n    \"confidence\": 85\n}",
