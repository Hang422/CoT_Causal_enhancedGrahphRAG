  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"The patient's symptoms, including severe abdominal pain, dark urine that worsens with sunlight exposure, and a history of attacks following erythromycin use, suggest a condition related to porphyrin metabolism. The dark urine indicates the presence of porphyrins, which are precursors in heme synthesis. The fact that the symptoms are exacerbated by certain medications points towards a porphyria, likely acute intermittent porphyria, which is caused by a deficiency in the enzyme porphobilinogen deaminase, leading to difficulties in heme synthesis.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opa\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}",
