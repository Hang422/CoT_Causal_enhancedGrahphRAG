  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Insulin resistance is a common feature in diabetic patients and can be influenced by various factors. Huminsulin, which is a form of human insulin, does not inherently cause more insulin resistance compared to other forms of insulin. Infections can exacerbate insulin resistance due to increased inflammatory cytokines. Antibodies to insulin can lead to insulin resistance as they may interfere with insulin's action. However, the use of glucocorticoids is generally not considered useful in managing insulin resistance; in fact, glucocorticoids can worsen insulin resistance. Therefore, the statement regarding glucocorticoids is the exception.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opd\",\n    \"confidence\": 85\n}",
