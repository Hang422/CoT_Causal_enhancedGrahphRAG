  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Fluconazole is an antifungal medication that is effective against various fungal infections, particularly those caused by Candida species. It is not effective against aspergillosis, which is primarily treated with other antifungals like voriconazole or amphotericin B. Fluconazole does penetrate the blood-brain barrier, making it useful for treating central nervous system infections. Its oral bioavailability is actually higher than that of ketoconazole. Fluconazole inhibits the enzyme lanosterol 14Î±-demethylase, which is involved in the demethylation of lanosterol, a step in ergosterol synthesis. Therefore, the most accurate statement is that it inhibits demethylation of lanosterol.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opd\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}",
