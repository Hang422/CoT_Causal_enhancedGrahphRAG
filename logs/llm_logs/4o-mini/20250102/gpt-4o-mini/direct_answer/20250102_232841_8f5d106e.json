  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Folic acid metabolism is primarily inhibited by Methotrexate and Trimethoprim, both of which interfere with folate metabolism. Sulfonamides also inhibit folate synthesis but through a different mechanism. Nitrous oxide can inactivate vitamin B12, which is indirectly related to folate metabolism. 5-Flucytosine does not have a direct effect on folic acid metabolism. Therefore, the best option that includes the main inhibitors is 'opb' (Methotrexate and Trimethoprim).\",\n    \"answer\": \"opb\",\n    \"confidence\": 85\n}",
