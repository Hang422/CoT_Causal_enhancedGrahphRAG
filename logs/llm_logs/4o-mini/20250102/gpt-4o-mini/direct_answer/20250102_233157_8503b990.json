  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Fosphenytoin is a prodrug of phenytoin and is primarily used for the treatment of status epilepticus and for patients who cannot tolerate phenytoin due to its solubility and administration route. It can be mixed with saline, unlike phenytoin, which cannot be mixed with saline due to its insolubility. Fosphenytoin is not indicated for absence seizures, nor is it the drug of choice for myoclonic seizures. Both drugs can be given orally, but the question specifically asks about the differences. Therefore, the correct answer is that it can be mixed with saline.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opb\",\n    \"confidence\": 90\n}",
