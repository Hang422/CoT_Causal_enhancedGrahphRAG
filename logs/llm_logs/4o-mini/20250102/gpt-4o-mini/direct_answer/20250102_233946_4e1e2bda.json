They secrete androgen-binding protein (ABP), which binds testosterone and helps maintain high levels of testosterone in the seminiferous tubules, essential for sperm development. Therefore, the correct answer is that Sertoli cells secrete androgen-binding protein.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opa\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}",
