  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Cisapride is known to cause QT interval prolongation, which can lead to torsades de pointes, especially when taken with other medications that also prolong the QT interval, such as erythromycin. The other options (famotidine, lansoprazole, and metoclopramide) are less likely to cause this effect. Therefore, the patient is most likely taking cisapride for his GERD.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opa\",\n    \"confidence\": 90\n}",
