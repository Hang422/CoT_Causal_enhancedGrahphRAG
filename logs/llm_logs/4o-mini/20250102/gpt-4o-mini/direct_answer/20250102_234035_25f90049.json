  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"The rate limiting enzyme in Vitamin D synthesis is not directly represented by any of the options provided. However, the conversion of 7-dehydrocholesterol to previtamin D3 in the skin is a crucial step in Vitamin D synthesis, making '7-dehydrocholesterol' the most relevant option in the context of the synthesis pathway. The other options refer to metabolites rather than the rate limiting step itself.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opd\",\n    \"confidence\": 85\n}",
