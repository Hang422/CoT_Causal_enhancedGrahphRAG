  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Inherited hyperammonemia is primarily associated with deficiencies in enzymes involved in the urea cycle, which is responsible for the detoxification of ammonia. N-acetyl glutamate synthetase is crucial for the activation of carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I, the first step in the urea cycle. A deficiency in this enzyme leads to an inability to process ammonia effectively, resulting in hyperammonemia. The other enzymes listed are not directly related to the urea cycle and do not cause inherited hyperammonemia.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opc\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}",
