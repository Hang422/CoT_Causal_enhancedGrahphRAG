  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Insulin is produced by beta cells of the pancreas, not alpha cells. It consists of two polypeptide chains linked by disulfide bonds, which is true. Insulin does not shift potassium outside the cell; rather, it facilitates the uptake of potassium into cells. The half-life of subcutaneous insulin is typically around 30 minutes to 1 hour, but this can vary based on the type of insulin. Therefore, the correct statement is that insulin consists of two polypeptide chains bound by disulfide linkages.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opb\",\n    \"confidence\": 90\n}",
