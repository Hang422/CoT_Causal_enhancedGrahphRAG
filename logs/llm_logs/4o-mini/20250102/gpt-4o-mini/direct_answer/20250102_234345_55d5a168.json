  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"The plasma membrane of a cell is connected to the cytoskeleton primarily through spectrin, which forms a mesh-like structure beneath the plasma membrane. Ankyrin serves as a linker protein that connects spectrin to integral membrane proteins, but it is not directly responsible for the connection itself. Tubulin is a component of microtubules and laminin is a protein found in the extracellular matrix, not directly involved in linking the plasma membrane to the cytoskeleton.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opa\",\n    \"confidence\": 90\n}",
