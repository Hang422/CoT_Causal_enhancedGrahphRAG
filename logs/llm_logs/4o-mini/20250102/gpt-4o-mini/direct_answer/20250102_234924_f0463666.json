Increase in glucagon/insulin ratio, increased CAMP and increased blood glucose\nopb. Decreased insulin, increased free fatty acid which is equivalent to blood glucose\nopc. Decreased insulin, increased free fatty acid which is not equivalent to blood glucose\nopd. Elevated insulin and free fatty acid, equivalent to blood glucose\n\n        ### Output Format\n        Provide your response in valid JSON format:\n        {   \n            \"final_analysis\": \"Your concise analysis following the above structure\",\n            \"answer\": \"Option key from the available options (only key,like opa)\",\n            \"confidence\": Score between 0-100 based on alignment with established medical facts\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"In diabetic ketoacidosis, there is a decreased level of insulin, which leads to increased lipolysis and subsequently elevated free fatty acids. This process does not equate free fatty acids to blood glucose levels, as the body is unable to utilize glucose effectively due to insulin deficiency. Therefore, the correct option is one that reflects decreased insulin and increased free fatty acids without equating them to blood glucose.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opc\",\n    \"confidence\": 90\n}",
