Among the options provided, Metoclopramide is known to cause hyperprolactinemia due to its dopamine antagonist properties. Bromocriptine, on the other hand, is a dopamine agonist used to treat hyperprolactinemia. Levodopa and Amantadine are primarily used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease and are not typically associated with increased prolactin levels.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opd\",\n    \"confidence\": 90\n}",
