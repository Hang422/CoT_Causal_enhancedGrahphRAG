  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"The child's symptoms of aggressive behavior, self-mutilation, joint pain, and reduced urinary output suggest a metabolic disorder. The combination of neurological symptoms and joint pain is indicative of a purine metabolism disorder. Adenosine Deaminase deficiency leads to the accumulation of toxic metabolites, which can cause neurological symptoms and immune dysfunction. Therefore, the most likely enzyme deficiency in this case is Adenosine Deaminase.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opb\",\n    \"confidence\": 85\n}",
