  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Ethambutol is primarily excreted by the kidneys, and its dosage needs to be adjusted in patients with renal impairment. Streptomycin and Capreomycin are also contraindicated in severe renal failure due to the risk of toxicity. Rifampicin is not primarily renally excreted but can still pose risks in severe renal failure. Therefore, Ethambutol is the safest option among the listed drugs for use in severe renal failure, provided that the dosage is adjusted appropriately.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opb\",\n    \"confidence\": 85\n}",
