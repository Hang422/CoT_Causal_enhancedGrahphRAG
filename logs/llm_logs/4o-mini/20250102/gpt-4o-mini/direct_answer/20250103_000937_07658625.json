  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"In the case of a needle stick injury involving a high-risk source (an AIDS patient with a very low CD4 count and high viral load), post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) is recommended. The standard PEP regimen includes a combination of antiretroviral medications for 28 days. The most appropriate option here is to administer zidovudine with lamivudine for 4 weeks, as this provides a more effective treatment than zidovudine alone. Monitoring the nurse's blood is not sufficient as immediate treatment is necessary to prevent HIV transmission.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opd\",\n    \"confidence\": 90\n}",
