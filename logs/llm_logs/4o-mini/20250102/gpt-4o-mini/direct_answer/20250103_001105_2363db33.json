  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"The HMP shunt, also known as the pentose phosphate pathway, is active in many tissues, including the liver, adipose tissue, and brain. However, red blood cells (RBCs) do not utilize the HMP shunt for their metabolic needs, as they primarily rely on glycolysis and anaerobic metabolism. Therefore, the correct answer is that the HMP shunt does not occur in RBCs.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opc\",\n    \"confidence\": 90\n}",
