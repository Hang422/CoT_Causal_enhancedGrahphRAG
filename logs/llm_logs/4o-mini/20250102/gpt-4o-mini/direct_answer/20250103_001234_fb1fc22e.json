  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Peptic ulcer disease caused by chronic use of NSAIDs is often treated with medications that protect the gastric mucosa and reduce acid secretion. Misoprostol is a prostaglandin analog that helps protect the stomach lining and is specifically indicated for preventing NSAID-induced ulcers. Esomeprazole, a proton pump inhibitor, is also effective in reducing gastric acid secretion but is not specifically indicated for NSAID-induced ulcers. Therefore, Misoprostol is the drug of choice in this scenario.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opc\",\n    \"confidence\": 90\n}",
