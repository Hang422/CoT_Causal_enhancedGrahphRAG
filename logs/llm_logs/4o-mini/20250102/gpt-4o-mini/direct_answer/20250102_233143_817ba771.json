  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Maintaining a high urinary pH during methotrexate treatment is crucial because methotrexate is a weak acid. When the urine is more alkaline, it enhances the solubility of methotrexate, reducing the risk of precipitation in the renal tubules and thus decreasing the likelihood of renal toxicity. This is particularly important in preventing bladder irritation and ensuring proper excretion of the drug.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opd\",\n    \"confidence\": 90\n}",
