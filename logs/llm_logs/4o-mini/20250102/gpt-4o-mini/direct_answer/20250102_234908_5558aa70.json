  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Propranolol (opa) is a beta-blocker primarily used for hypertension and anxiety, and it is not commonly associated with depression as a side effect. In contrast, reserpine (opc) is known to cause depression due to its mechanism of depleting monoamines. Flupenthixol (opd) is an antipsychotic that can also lead to depressive symptoms. Oral contraceptives (opb) have been reported to have mood-related side effects, including depression in some users. Therefore, the least likely to cause depression is propranolol.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opa\",\n    \"confidence\": 85\n}",
