  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Aspirin causes platelet dysfunction by irreversibly inhibiting cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1), which leads to decreased thromboxane A2 production and impaired platelet aggregation. This effect can increase the risk of bleeding when combined with heparin, which is an anticoagulant that also affects hemostasis. Therefore, aspirin is generally avoided in patients already on heparin due to the potential for enhanced bleeding risk.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opa\",\n    \"confidence\": 90\n}",
