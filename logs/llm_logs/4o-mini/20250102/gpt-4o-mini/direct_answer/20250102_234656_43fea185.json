It has good bioavailability, but it is not 100% (option opb is misleading). Nizatidine does not enhance gastric emptying (option opc is false). While tachycardia can occur with some H2 blockers, it is not a common or well-documented side effect of Nizatidine specifically (option opd is also misleading). Therefore, the statement that is not true is option opc.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opc\",\n    \"confidence\": 85\n}",
