  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Atropine is a muscarinic receptor antagonist that can block the effects of acetylcholine at muscarinic receptors. It would block bradycardia caused by acetylcholine infusion (option c) but would not affect increased blood pressure caused by nicotine (option a) or increased skeletal muscle strength caused by neostigmine (option b), as these effects are mediated through different mechanisms. Therefore, the correct answer is option c only, not all of them.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opc\",\n    \"confidence\": 85\n}",
