  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Phenytoin is known to follow zero order kinetics at therapeutic levels, meaning that its elimination rate is constant regardless of concentration. It is also a hepatic enzyme inducer, particularly of CYP450 enzymes. Phenytoin is not excreted unchanged in urine; rather, it is metabolized in the liver. Additionally, phenytoin is teratogenic and can cause fetal hydantoin syndrome when taken during pregnancy. Therefore, the only true statement is that it follows zero order kinetics.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opa\",\n    \"confidence\": 90\n}",
