  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Propranolol is a non-selective beta-blocker that is effective in managing conditions such as atrial flutter, Parkinsonian tremor, and thyrotoxicosis due to its ability to reduce heart rate and tremors. However, it is not typically used in hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM) as it can worsen the outflow obstruction in some patients.
