Abciximab\nopb. Eptifibatide\nopc. Tirofiban\nopd. Prasugrel\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nGp2b3A inhibitors are a class of drugs that specifically inhibit the glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor on platelets, preventing platelet aggregation. The main examples of Gp2b3A inhibitors include abciximab, eptifibatide, and tirofiban. In contrast, prasugrel is classified as a thienopyridine antiplatelet agent that works through a different mechanism by inhibiting the ADP receptor on platelets, thus it does not belong to the Gp2b3A inhibitor class. Therefore, the correct answer to the question is prasugrel, as it is not a Gp2b3A inhibitor.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

The drugs listed in the options include abciximab, eptifibatide, and tirofiban, all of which are recognized Gp2b3A inhibitors. In contrast, prasugrel is a thienopyridine that works by inhibiting the ADP receptor, thus preventing platelet activation through a different mechanism. Therefore, prasugrel does not belong to the Gp2b3A inhibitor class. This distinction is clear and aligns with established pharmacological knowledge. Hence, the correct answer is prasugrel, as it is not a Gp2b3A inhibitor.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
