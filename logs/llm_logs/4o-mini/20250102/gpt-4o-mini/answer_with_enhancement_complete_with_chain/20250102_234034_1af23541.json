Carbamazepine\nopb. Vigabatrin\nopc. Sodium valproate\nopd. Lamotrigine\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nCarbamazepine is approved for mood stabilization and is indicated for bipolar disorder. Sodium valproate is also effective in mood stabilization and is indicated for bipolar disorder. Lamotrigine is used for maintenance treatment in bipolar disorder, confirming its indication. In contrast, Vigabatrin is primarily used for epilepsy and is not indicated for bipolar disorder, as it is not commonly used for mood disorders and conflicts with bipolar treatment guidelines. Therefore, the drug not indicated for bipolar disorder is Vigabatrin.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"In the treatment of bipolar disorder, several medications are commonly used for mood stabilization. Carbamazepine (option opa) is indicated for bipolar disorder and is effective in managing manic episodes. Sodium valproate (option opc) is also indicated and is widely used for mood stabilization. Lamotrigine (option opd) is primarily used for maintenance therapy in bipolar disorder, particularly for preventing depressive episodes. However, Vigabatrin (option opb) is primarily an anticonvulsant used for epilepsy and is not indicated for the treatment of bipolar disorder. Therefore, based on established medical guidelines and consensus, Vigabatrin is the drug that is not indicated for bipolar disorder.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
