Ascaris\nopb. Filariasis\nopc. Malaria\nopd. Oncocerciasis\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nIvermectin is an antiparasitic medication indicated for specific parasitic infections. It is effective against Onchocerciasis and Filariasis, both of which are caused by filarial worms. However, it is not indicated for Malaria, which is caused by Plasmodium species and requires different treatment options. The reasoning chains correctly identify that Ivermectin is not effective against Malaria, aligning with the consensus that it is not used for this condition. Therefore, the correct answer is that Ivermectin is indicated in all of the following except Malaria.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Ivermectin is an antiparasitic medication that is effective against certain parasitic infections, specifically Onchocerciasis (caused by Onchocerca volvulus) and Filariasis (caused by various filarial worms). It is also effective against Ascaris lumbricoides, a type of roundworm. However, Ivermectin is not indicated for Malaria, which is caused by Plasmodium species and requires antimalarial medications such as chloroquine or artemisinin-based therapies. Therefore, the correct answer is that Ivermectin is indicated in all of the following except for Malaria, as it does not have any efficacy against this disease. This conclusion aligns with established medical guidelines and consensus regarding the use of Ivermectin. Thus, the best-supported option is Malaria.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opc\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
