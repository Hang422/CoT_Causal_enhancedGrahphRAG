Retinol\nopb. Retinal\nopc. Retinoic acids\nopd. All of the above\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nVitamin A exists in several forms, including retinol, retinal, and retinoic acids, all of which are functionally related. Retinal is essential for vision as it is a key component of rhodopsin, which is crucial for phototransduction. Retinol and retinoic acids also play significant roles in gene expression, immune function, and skin health. Retinoic acids act as hormones that regulate transcription of target genes, while retinol is important for immune cell function and skin cell turnover. Therefore, all forms of vitamin A contribute to these vital biological functions, confirming that the correct answer is 'All of the above.'\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Vitamin A is a crucial nutrient that exists in several forms, including retinol, retinal, and retinoic acids. Each of these forms plays significant roles in various biological functions. Retinol is important for immune function and skin health, retinal is essential for vision, and retinoic acids are involved in gene expression and cellular differentiation. Given that all these forms contribute to vital physiological processes, the most accurate answer is 'All of the above.'
