Aldosterone\nopb. DOCA\nopc. Fludrocoeisone\nopd. Triamcinolone\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nAldosterone is recognized as the most potent mineralocorticoid, primarily regulating sodium and potassium balance in the body. While DOCA (Deoxycorticosterone Acetate) is also a mineralocorticoid, it is less potent than aldosterone. Fludrocortisone is a synthetic mineralocorticoid that is more potent than cortisol but still not as potent as aldosterone. Triamcinolone, on the other hand, is a glucocorticoid and does not possess mineralocorticoid activity. Therefore, the consensus supports that aldosterone is the most potent mineralocorticoid.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "
