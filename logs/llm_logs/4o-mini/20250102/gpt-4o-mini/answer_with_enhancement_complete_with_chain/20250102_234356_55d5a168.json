Spectrin\nopb. Ankyrin\nopc. Tubulin\nopd. Laminin\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nThe plasma membrane is anchored to the cytoskeleton primarily through the interaction of Spectrin and Ankyrin. Spectrin is a cytoskeletal protein that provides structural support and is directly associated with the plasma membrane. Ankyrin serves as an anchoring protein that connects Spectrin to the membrane, facilitating the linkage between the membrane and the cytoskeleton. Tubulin, while a component of the cytoskeleton, is not directly involved in anchoring the plasma membrane. Laminin is part of the extracellular matrix and does not play a role in this specific anchoring process. Therefore, the most relevant options are Spectrin and Ankyrin, with Ankyrin being crucial for the connection of Spectrin to the membrane.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "
