Allopurinol\nopb. Probenecid\nopc. Indomethacin\nopd. Aspirin\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nProbenecid is a uricosuric drug as it inhibits renal tubular reabsorption of uric acid, leading to increased uric acid excretion. Allopurinol, on the other hand, is not a uricosuric drug; it inhibits xanthine oxidase, reducing uric acid production. Indomethacin is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that does not have a uricosuric effect. Aspirin, particularly at low doses, can inhibit uric acid excretion and is not classified as a uricosuric drug. Therefore, the only uricosuric drug among the options is Probenecid.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The question asks for a uricosuric drug, which is defined as a medication that increases the excretion of uric acid in the urine. Among the options provided: Allopurinol is a xanthine oxidase inhibitor that decreases uric acid production, not a uricosuric. Probenecid is known to inhibit the renal tubular reabsorption of uric acid, thus increasing its excretion, making it a uricosuric drug. Indomethacin is an NSAID and does not have uricosuric properties. Aspirin, particularly at low doses, can actually reduce uric acid excretion. Therefore, the only correct answer is Probenecid, which is well-established in medical literature as a uricosuric agent. The reasoning aligns with the enhanced information provided, confirming Probenecid as the correct choice.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
