Cholestyramine\nopb. Thiazide diuretics\nopc. Quinidine\nopd. Amlodipine\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nDigoxin is known to interact with several drugs, leading to significant clinical implications. Cholestyramine binds to digoxin in the gastrointestinal tract, reducing its absorption and potentially decreasing its effectiveness. Thiazide diuretics can cause electrolyte imbalances, particularly hypokalemia, which increases the risk of digoxin toxicity. Quinidine, an antiarrhythmic, is known to increase digoxin levels, heightening the risk of toxicity. In contrast, Amlodipine, a calcium channel blocker, does not significantly affect digoxin levels, and minimal interaction is expected. Therefore, the drug that does not have significant interactions with digoxin is Amlodipine.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "
