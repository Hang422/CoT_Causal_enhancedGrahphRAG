B1\nopb. B2\nopc. B6\nopd. B12\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nWernicke's encephalopathy is primarily associated with thiamine (vitamin B1) deficiency. This condition is characterized by symptoms such as confusion and ataxia, which are directly linked to thiamine deficiency. Chronic alcoholism is a significant risk factor, as it often leads to poor nutritional intake and malabsorption syndromes, further contributing to thiamine deficiency. The reasoning chains correctly identify thiamine as the key vitamin involved, and the evidence paths support the connection between Wernicke's encephalopathy and thiamine deficiency, particularly in the context of chronic alcoholism and malnutrition. Therefore, the major vitamin deficiency in Wernicke's encephalopathy is vitamin B1.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Wernicke's encephalopathy is a neurological condition that is primarily caused by a deficiency in thiamine (vitamin B1). The symptoms of this condition, such as confusion, ataxia, and ophthalmoplegia, are directly linked to the lack of thiamine, which is crucial for carbohydrate metabolism and neuronal function. Chronic alcoholism is a common risk factor for this deficiency due to poor dietary intake and malabsorption. The enhanced information confirms that thiamine deficiency is the major vitamin deficiency associated with Wernicke's encephalopathy, aligning with established medical knowledge. Therefore, the most likely correct answer is vitamin B1 (thiamine).\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
