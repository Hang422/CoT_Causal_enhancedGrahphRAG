Increase in glucagon/insulin ratio, increased CAMP and increased blood glucose\nopb. Decreased insulin, increased free fatty acid which is equivalent to blood glucose\nopc. Decreased insulin, increased free fatty acid which is not equivalent to blood glucose\nopd. Elevated insulin and free fatty acid, equivalent to blood glucose\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nIn diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), there is a significant decrease in insulin levels due to the underlying diabetes mellitus, which leads to an increased glucagon/insulin ratio. This results in elevated cAMP levels and increased blood glucose. The presence of increased free fatty acids is also noted, but they are not equivalent to blood glucose levels in this context. Therefore, the correct features of ketoacidosis due to diabetes mellitus include decreased insulin, increased glucagon, and increased blood glucose, while free fatty acids are elevated but do not equate to blood glucose. The consensus supports that in DKA, insulin deficiency leads to increased lipolysis and ketogenesis, contributing to the metabolic state observed.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"In diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), there is a significant decrease in insulin levels, which leads to an increase in the glucagon/insulin ratio. This results in elevated cAMP levels and increased blood glucose. Additionally, the lack of insulin promotes lipolysis, leading to increased free fatty acids. However, while free fatty acids are elevated, they do not equate to blood glucose levels in this context. Therefore, the most accurate option that reflects the biochemical changes in DKA is one that indicates decreased insulin and increased free fatty acids, but clarifies that these free fatty acids are not equivalent to blood glucose. The best-supported option is 'opc', which states decreased insulin and increased free fatty acid which is not equivalent to blood glucose.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opc\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}",
