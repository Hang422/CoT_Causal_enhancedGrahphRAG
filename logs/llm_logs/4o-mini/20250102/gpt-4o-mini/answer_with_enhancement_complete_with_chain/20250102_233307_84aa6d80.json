Reducing aqueous humor secretion\nopb. Contracting iris sphincter muscle\nopc. Increasing aqueous humor outflow\nopd. Relaxing ciliary muscle\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nPilocarpine reduces intraocular pressure in closed angle glaucoma primarily by contracting the iris sphincter muscle, which induces miosis and opens the angle of the anterior chamber. This action facilitates increased aqueous humor outflow, thereby lowering intraocular pressure. The reasoning chains confirm that pilocarpine's stimulation of muscarinic receptors leads to contraction of the ciliary muscle, enhancing aqueous humor drainage. The evidence paths related to contraction and miosis support the understanding of pilocarpine's mechanism in treating glaucoma, while irrelevant paths regarding epilepsy and presbyopia do not contribute to this specific context.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Pilocarpine is a muscarinic agonist that primarily acts to reduce intraocular pressure in closed angle glaucoma by inducing miosis (contraction of the iris sphincter muscle). This contraction helps to open the angle of the anterior chamber, facilitating increased outflow of aqueous humor. While it does have effects on the ciliary muscle, the primary mechanism in the context of closed angle glaucoma is the contraction of the iris sphincter muscle, which directly aids in opening the angle and improving drainage. Therefore, the most accurate answer is that pilocarpine reduces intraocular pressure by contracting the iris sphincter muscle, which aligns with the enhanced information provided.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}",
