Endometrial carcinoma\nopc. >Carcinoma in contralateral breast\nopd. >Cataract\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nTamoxifen is associated with several adverse effects. The use of tamoxifen increases the risk of thromboembolism, which is a known adverse effect (CHAIN: 95%). It also has a documented association with an increased risk of endometrial carcinoma (CHAIN: 90%). The risk of carcinoma in the contralateral breast is considered a possible adverse effect, but it is less clearly established compared to the first two (CHAIN: 80%). Cataract development is recognized as a less commonly associated adverse effect of tamoxifen (CHAIN: 70%). Therefore, while thromboembolism, endometrial carcinoma, and contralateral breast carcinoma are all linked to tamoxifen use, cataracts are not as strongly associated, making it the exception among the listed options.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Tamoxifen is a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) commonly used in the treatment of estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer. It is associated with several adverse effects. The known adverse effects include thromboembolism, which is a well-documented risk due to its estrogenic activity. Endometrial carcinoma is also a recognized risk, as tamoxifen can stimulate the endometrial lining. The risk of carcinoma in the contralateral breast is less clearly established but is still considered a potential risk. Cataracts, while they can occur, are not as strongly associated with tamoxifen use compared to the other listed adverse effects. Therefore, among the options provided, cataracts are the least likely to be directly attributed to tamoxifen use, making it the exception. Thus, the best-supported answer is that tamoxifen does not commonly cause cataracts compared to the other listed adverse effects.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
