Morphine\nopb. Dextromethorphan\nopc. Diphenhydramine\nopd. Aprepitant\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nDextromethorphan is an NMDA receptor antagonist, which can lead to dissociative effects and possible hallucinations, making it a significant candidate for causing such symptoms. Diphenhydramine, an anticholinergic agent, can also lead to CNS effects including confusion and hallucinations, though this is less common. Morphine, an opioid receptor agonist, primarily causes CNS depression and altered mental status, which can include hallucinations, but this is less frequent compared to the other two. Aprepitant, a substance P/neurokinin 1 receptor antagonist, is not commonly associated with hallucinations and is unlikely to cause such effects. Therefore, the most likely antitussives to lead to hallucinations are Dextromethorphan and Diphenhydramine.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Dextromethorphan is well-documented as an NMDA receptor antagonist, and at high doses, it can lead to dissociative effects and hallucinations. This makes it a strong candidate for causing such symptoms. Diphenhydramine, while primarily an antihistamine, has anticholinergic properties that can lead to CNS effects, including confusion and hallucinations, particularly in higher doses or in sensitive individuals. Morphine can cause altered mental status and hallucinations, but this is less common compared to the other two. Aprepitant is not associated with hallucinations. Given the evidence, Dextromethorphan is the most likely antitussive to lead to hallucinations, with Diphenhydramine being a secondary option. Therefore, the best-supported option is Dextromethorphan (opb).\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
