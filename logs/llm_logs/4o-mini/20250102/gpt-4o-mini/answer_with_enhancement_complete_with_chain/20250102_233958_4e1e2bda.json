Androgen binding protein\nopb. Testosterone\nopc. LH\nopd. FSH\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nSertoli cells are crucial for spermatogenesis and secrete androgen binding protein (ABP), which binds testosterone and facilitates its action on germ cells. This aligns with the consensus that Sertoli cells produce ABP to support spermatogenesis. They are stimulated by FSH, which promotes their function and indirectly influences testosterone levels. While Sertoli cells respond to testosterone, they do not secrete it; rather, they support its action. LH primarily stimulates Leydig cells to produce testosterone, not Sertoli cells directly. Therefore, the most accurate option regarding what Sertoli cells secrete is androgen binding protein.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Sertoli cells play a vital role in the process of spermatogenesis and are known to secrete androgen binding protein (ABP). This protein binds to testosterone, which is essential for the maturation of sperm cells. While Sertoli cells are influenced by FSH and indirectly support testosterone action, they do not produce testosterone themselves; that function is carried out by Leydig cells under the stimulation of LH. Therefore, the most accurate answer regarding what Sertoli cells secrete is androgen binding protein. The other options (testosterone, LH, and FSH) do not align with the known functions of Sertoli cells. Thus, the best-supported option is 'Androgen binding protein'.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
