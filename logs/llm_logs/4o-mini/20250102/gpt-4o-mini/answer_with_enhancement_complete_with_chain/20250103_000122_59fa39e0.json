Thiothixanthene\nopb. Phenothiazine\nopc. Butyrophenone\nopd. Diphenyl butyl piperidine\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nPimozide is an antipsychotic medication primarily used to treat Tourette syndrome and is classified as a butyrophenone. The reasoning chains confirm that Pimozide acts as a dopamine receptor antagonist, which is characteristic of butyrophenones, and it is not classified under phenothiazines, thiothixanthenes, or diphenyl butyl piperidines. The evidence paths support its classification as an antipsychotic and its interaction with dopamine antagonists, reinforcing its categorization as a butyrophenone.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Pimozide is an antipsychotic medication that is primarily used for the treatment of Tourette syndrome. It is classified as a butyrophenone, which is a class of antipsychotic drugs that act as dopamine receptor antagonists. The other options provided (thiothixanthene, phenothiazine, and diphenyl butyl piperidine) represent different classes of antipsychotic medications, but they do not include pimozide. The enhanced information confirms that pimozide's mechanism of action and classification align with the characteristics of butyrophenones. Therefore, the most accurate classification for pimozide is as a butyrophenone.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opc\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
