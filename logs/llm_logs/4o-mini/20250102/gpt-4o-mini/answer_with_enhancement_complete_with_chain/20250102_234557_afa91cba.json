Collecting duct\nopb. Glomerulus\nopc. Proximal convoluted tubule\nopd. Loop of Henle\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nAldosterone is a hormone secreted by the adrenal glands that primarily acts on the kidneys, specifically at the collecting duct of the nephron. It regulates sodium and potassium levels by promoting sodium reabsorption and increasing water retention, which is crucial for maintaining fluid balance. The reasoning chains correctly identify the collecting duct as the primary site of action for aldosterone, with consensus supporting its role in influencing electrolyte balance and fluid homeostasis. Evidence paths related to renal tubule structure confirm the relevance of the collecting duct in aldosterone's function, while broader paths regarding cytoprotection and excretory function do not directly clarify the specific action of aldosterone.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Aldosterone is a steroid hormone produced by the adrenal cortex that plays a critical role in regulating sodium and potassium levels in the body. Its primary site of action is the collecting duct of the nephron, where it promotes sodium reabsorption and potassium excretion. This mechanism is essential for maintaining fluid balance and blood pressure. The other options, such as the glomerulus, proximal convoluted tubule, and loop of Henle, do not primarily respond to aldosterone in the same way. Therefore, based on established physiological principles and consensus in the medical community, the most accurate answer is that aldosterone acts at the collecting duct.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
