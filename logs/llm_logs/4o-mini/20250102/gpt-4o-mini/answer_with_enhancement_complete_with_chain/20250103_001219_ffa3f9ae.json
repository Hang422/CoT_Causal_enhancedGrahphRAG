Selenium\nopb. Phosphorus\nopc. Boron\nopd. Zinc\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nCardiomyopathy can be associated with deficiencies in certain nutrients, but the strongest consensus points to selenium and zinc. Selenium deficiency is linked to increased oxidative stress and myocardial damage, which can lead to cardiomyopathy. Zinc deficiency is also associated with impaired immune function and increased inflammation, potentially resulting in heart muscle damage and cardiomyopathy. Phosphorus deficiency can disrupt energy metabolism and impair cardiac function, but its direct link to cardiomyopathy is less established. Boron deficiency has unclear links to cardiomyopathy and is not widely recognized as a contributing factor. Therefore, selenium and zinc are the most relevant deficiencies associated with cardiomyopathy.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Cardiomyopathy can be influenced by various nutritional deficiencies, with selenium and zinc being the most commonly recognized. Selenium deficiency is particularly noted for its role in oxidative stress and myocardial damage, which can lead to cardiomyopathy. Zinc deficiency is also significant as it affects immune function and inflammation, both of which can contribute to heart muscle damage. While phosphorus and boron deficiencies have been discussed, their direct links to cardiomyopathy are less established. Therefore, based on the consensus in the medical literature, selenium (option opa) is the most strongly associated deficiency with cardiomyopathy, followed closely by zinc. However, since the question asks for a singular deficiency, selenium is the best-supported option.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
