Atrial flutter\nopb. Parkinsonian tremor\nopc. Thyrotoxicosis\nopd. HOCM\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nPropranolol is a non-selective beta-blocker commonly used for various conditions. It is effective in managing atrial flutter by controlling heart rate and rhythm. In the case of thyrotoxicosis, propranolol helps alleviate symptoms such as tachycardia and tremors, making it beneficial in this context. However, it is not primarily indicated for Parkinsonian tremor, as other treatments are preferred for this condition. Regarding hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM), propranolol is indeed indicated as it helps reduce left ventricular outflow obstruction. Therefore, the correct answer is that propranolol is not useful for Parkinsonian tremor.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "
