Tamsulosin\nopb. Prazosin\nopc. Oxazocin\nopd. Dolazoline\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nAlpha-1 adrenergic blockers are effective in providing symptomatic relief in benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) by relaxing smooth muscle in the prostate and urethra, thereby reducing urinary obstruction. Tamsulosin is a selective alpha-1A blocker that specifically decreases resistance in the prostatic urethra, leading to improved urinary flow and is well-supported in clinical use for BPH. Prazosin, while an alpha-1 blocker, is less selective and primarily used for hypertension, which may limit its efficacy for urinary symptoms in BPH. Oxazocin is also an alpha-1 blocker but is less commonly used and has unclear efficacy in BPH. Dolazoline, an alpha-2 adrenergic agonist, is not primarily indicated for BPH and is unlikely to provide symptomatic relief. Therefore, Tamsulosin is the most appropriate choice for symptomatic relief in BPH.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "
