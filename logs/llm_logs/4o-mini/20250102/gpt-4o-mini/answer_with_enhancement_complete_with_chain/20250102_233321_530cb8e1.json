PAS\nopb. Ethionamide\nopc. Cycloserine\nopd. Pyrazinamide\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nHypothyroidism can be caused by certain anti-tubercular drugs. Ethionamide is known to inhibit thyroid hormone synthesis, leading to decreased levels of T3 and T4, which can result in hypothyroidism. This aligns with the consensus that Ethionamide is a potential cause of hypothyroidism. PAS (p-Aminosalicylic Acid) may interfere with thyroid function, but the evidence is less definitive, indicating a possible but not established link to hypothyroidism. Cycloserine has no established link to hypothyroidism, and its effects on thyroid function are unclear, making it unlikely to cause hypothyroidism. Pyrazinamide does not have a direct effect on thyroid hormone synthesis and is also unlikely to cause hypothyroidism. Therefore, the most consensus-supported option for causing hypothyroidism is Ethionamide.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "
