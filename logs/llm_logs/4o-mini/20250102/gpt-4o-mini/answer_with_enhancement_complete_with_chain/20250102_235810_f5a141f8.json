Hyponatremia\nopb. Hyperkalemia\nopc. Hypoglycemia\nopd. Metabolic alkalosis\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nAdrenal insufficiency is characterized by decreased production of cortisol and aldosterone. This leads to several physiological changes: 1) Hyponatremia occurs due to decreased aldosterone, which normally promotes sodium retention; thus, this option is associated with adrenal insufficiency. 2) Hyperkalemia results from decreased aldosterone, which leads to potassium retention; this option is also associated with adrenal insufficiency. 3) Hypoglycemia can occur due to decreased cortisol, which impairs gluconeogenesis; therefore, this option is associated as well. 4) Metabolic alkalosis is not typically associated with adrenal insufficiency; rather, adrenal insufficiency often leads to metabolic acidosis due to the loss of sodium and retention of potassium. Thus, the correct answer is metabolic alkalosis, as it is not associated with adrenal insufficiency.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "
