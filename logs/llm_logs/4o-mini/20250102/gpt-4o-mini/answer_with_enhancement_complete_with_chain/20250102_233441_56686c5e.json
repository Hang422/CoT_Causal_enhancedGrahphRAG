It is an enzyme inducer\nopb. It causes obesity\nopc. It causes Hirsutism\nopd. It causes neural tube defects\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nValproic acid is known to cause weight gain, which can be associated with obesity, thus supporting option 'opb'. It can also cause hirsutism due to hormonal changes, confirming option 'opc'. Additionally, valproic acid is recognized as a teratogen and is associated with neural tube defects, supporting option 'opd'. However, it is not an enzyme inducer; rather, it is an enzyme inhibitor, which contradicts option 'opa'. Therefore, the correct answer to the question is that valproic acid does not act as an enzyme inducer.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Valproic acid is primarily known for its role as an anticonvulsant and mood stabilizer. It is recognized for several side effects and risks. Firstly, it is not an enzyme inducer; in fact, it is an enzyme inhibitor, which means it can increase the levels of other drugs metabolized by the liver. This supports the conclusion that option 'opa' is incorrect. Secondly, weight gain associated with valproic acid can lead to obesity, which supports option 'opb'. Thirdly, hirsutism is a known side effect due to hormonal changes, confirming option 'opc'. Lastly, valproic acid is a teratogen and is associated with neural tube defects, supporting option 'opd'. Therefore, the only statement that is incorrect is that valproic acid is an enzyme inducer, making 'opa' the correct answer.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
