Proximal tubule\nopb. Distal tubules\nopc. Loop of Henle\nopd. Collecting duct\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nAldosterone primarily acts on the distal tubules and collecting duct of the nephron. It increases sodium reabsorption and potassium excretion, which are critical for regulating electrolyte balance and fluid retention. The reasoning chains correctly highlight that aldosterone stimulates sodium-potassium ATPase, enhancing sodium reabsorption significantly in these areas. Evidence paths related to aldosterone's role in electrolyte balance and excretory function support this consensus, confirming its primary action in the distal tubules and collecting duct.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Aldosterone is a steroid hormone produced by the adrenal cortex that plays a crucial role in regulating sodium and potassium levels in the body. Its primary action occurs in the distal tubules and collecting duct of the nephron. Aldosterone promotes sodium reabsorption and potassium excretion by stimulating the sodium-potassium ATPase pump, which is predominantly located in these segments of the nephron. While the proximal tubule and Loop of Henle are involved in electrolyte and fluid balance, they are not the primary sites of aldosterone action. Therefore, the most accurate answer, based on established medical knowledge, is that aldosterone acts on the distal tubules and collecting duct.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}",
