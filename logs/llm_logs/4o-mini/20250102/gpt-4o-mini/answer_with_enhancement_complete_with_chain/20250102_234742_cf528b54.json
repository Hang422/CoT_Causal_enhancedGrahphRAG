This results in the production of dilute urine, characterized by low urine osmolality. The standard consensus indicates that urine osmolality in Diabetes insipidus is typically less than 300 mmol/L, often around 100-200 mmol/L. Therefore, the most accurate option reflecting this consensus is <300 mmol/L. The other options, while they may reflect varying degrees of dilution, do not align with the established understanding of urine osmolality in this condition.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"In Diabetes insipidus, the primary issue is a deficiency of antidiuretic hormone (ADH), which leads to the kidneys' inability to concentrate urine. As a result, the urine produced is typically very dilute, with low osmolality. The consensus in medical literature indicates that urine osmolality in Diabetes insipidus is generally less than 300 mmol/L, often falling within the range of 100-200 mmol/L. Therefore, the most appropriate answer reflecting this understanding is <300 mmol/L. The other options, while they represent varying degrees of dilution, do not accurately capture the typical findings in this condition.
