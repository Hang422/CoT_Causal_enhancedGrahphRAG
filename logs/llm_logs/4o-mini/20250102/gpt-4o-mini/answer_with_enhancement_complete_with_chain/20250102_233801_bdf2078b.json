Protein C deficiency\nopb. Protein S deficiency\nopc. Hemophillia\nopd. Antithrombin III deficiency\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nWarfarin-induced skin necrosis is primarily associated with deficiencies in Protein C and Protein S. Warfarin inhibits vitamin K-dependent clotting factors, leading to a decrease in Protein C levels, which can precipitate thrombosis and subsequent skin necrosis. Protein C deficiency is a well-established risk factor for this complication, as it can lead to purpura fulminans, a severe form of skin necrosis. Protein S deficiency also contributes to this risk, as it is a cofactor for Protein C. In contrast, Hemophilia and Antithrombin III deficiency are not typically associated with warfarin-induced skin necrosis. Hemophilia primarily affects the intrinsic pathway of coagulation and does not lead to skin necrosis in the context of warfarin use. Antithrombin III deficiency is more related to thrombotic events but does not directly correlate with skin necrosis due to warfarin. Therefore, the most relevant options are Protein C and Protein S deficiencies.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Warfarin-induced skin necrosis is primarily associated with deficiencies in Protein C and Protein S. When warfarin is initiated, it can lead to a rapid decrease in the levels of these proteins, which are crucial for regulating coagulation. In patients with Protein C deficiency, the risk of developing skin necrosis is significantly increased due to the lack of this anticoagulant protein, which normally helps to prevent clot formation in the microcirculation of the skin. Protein S deficiency also poses a risk, as it acts as a cofactor for Protein C. In contrast, Hemophilia and Antithrombin III deficiency do not have a direct association with warfarin-induced skin necrosis. Therefore, the most relevant options are Protein C deficiency and Protein S deficiency, with Protein C deficiency being the more established risk factor. Given this information, the best-supported option is Protein C deficiency.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}",
