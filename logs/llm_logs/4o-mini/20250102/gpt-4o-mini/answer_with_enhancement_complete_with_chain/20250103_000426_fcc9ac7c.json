Fatty acids\nopb. Ketone bodies\nopc. Glucose\nopd. Any of the above\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nCardiac muscle primarily utilizes fatty acids as its main energy source under normal conditions, as they are abundant in the bloodstream and undergo beta-oxidation to produce ATP. However, cardiac muscle is also capable of utilizing ketone bodies and glucose, especially during periods of fasting or increased demand. Ketone bodies are converted to acetyl-CoA, which enters the Krebs cycle, while glucose is metabolized through glycolysis to pyruvate, which is also converted to acetyl-CoA. All three substrates can effectively produce ATP, demonstrating the adaptability of cardiac muscle to different energy sources. Therefore, the correct answer is 'Any of the above' (option d), as cardiac muscle can utilize fatty acids, ketone bodies, and glucose for energy.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "
