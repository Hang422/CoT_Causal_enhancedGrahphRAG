Nimodipine\nopb. Amlodipine\nopc. Diltiazem\nopd. Verapamil\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nNimodipine is the drug indicated for subarachnoid hemorrhage due to its specific efficacy in preventing cerebral vasospasm, a common complication following this condition. The reasoning chain correctly identifies that subarachnoid hemorrhage leads to vasospasm, necessitating vasodilator therapy, and that Nimodipine, a calcium channel blocker, is specifically indicated for this purpose. Other calcium channel blockers such as Amlodipine, Diltiazem, and Verapamil are not specifically indicated for vasospasm prevention and are considered less effective than Nimodipine in this context. Evidence supports that Nimodipine treats cerebral vasospasm, confirming its role in managing complications from subarachnoid hemorrhage.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is a serious condition that can lead to complications such as cerebral vasospasm. Nimodipine is a calcium channel blocker that has been specifically studied and shown to be effective in preventing and treating cerebral vasospasm following SAH. Other calcium channel blockers like Amlodipine, Diltiazem, and Verapamil are not indicated for this specific purpose and do not have the same level of evidence supporting their use in this context. Therefore, based on the consensus in medical literature, Nimodipine is the most appropriate choice for managing complications associated with subarachnoid hemorrhage.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
