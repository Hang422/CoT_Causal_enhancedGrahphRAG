Duodenum\nopb. Ileum\nopc. Jejunum\nopd. Colon\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nVitamin B12 absorption requires intrinsic factor, which is produced in the stomach and binds to vitamin B12 to form a complex. This complex is then transported to the ileum, where absorption occurs. All reasoning chains correctly identify the ileum as the site of absorption for the intrinsic factor-B12 complex, aligning with medical consensus. Evidence paths supporting the role of intrinsic factor in the uptake process in the ileum further confirm this. Therefore, the correct answer is that vitamin B12 intrinsic factor absorption occurs in the ileum.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Vitamin B12 absorption is a well-established physiological process that requires intrinsic factor, which is secreted by the parietal cells of the stomach. The intrinsic factor binds to vitamin B12, forming a complex that is essential for the absorption of vitamin B12. This complex travels through the gastrointestinal tract and is specifically absorbed in the ileum, which is the final section of the small intestine. The duodenum and jejunum do not play a significant role in the absorption of the intrinsic factor-B12 complex. The colon is not involved in this process at all. Therefore, the consensus in medical literature clearly indicates that the absorption of vitamin B12 intrinsic factor occurs in the ileum. This aligns with the enhanced information provided, which confirms the ileum as the correct site for this absorption process.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
