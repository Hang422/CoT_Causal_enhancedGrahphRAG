Morphine patch\nopb. Diazepam\nopc. Clobazam\nopd. Haloperidol\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nIn palliative care for lung cancer patients experiencing dyspnoea, the use of a morphine patch is well-supported by consensus as it effectively decreases the perception of breathlessness, leading to reduced dyspnoea. This aligns with evidence indicating that morphine can prevent dyspnoea. Diazepam and clobazam may provide some relief through their anxiolytic effects, potentially improving comfort related to anxiety, but their direct impact on dyspnoea is less established, with diazepam showing a possible improvement in comfort but not specifically targeting dyspnoea. Haloperidol, while it may reduce anxiety, has an unclear impact on dyspnoea and is not typically used for this purpose. Therefore, the most effective option for palliation of dyspnoea in this context is the morphine patch.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"In the context of palliative care for lung cancer patients suffering from dyspnoea, the primary goal is to alleviate the sensation of breathlessness effectively. Morphine, particularly in the form of a patch, is well-documented in medical literature as an effective treatment for dyspnoea, as it can reduce the perception of breathlessness and improve overall comfort. While diazepam and clobazam may help with anxiety and indirectly improve comfort, they do not directly target dyspnoea. Haloperidol is not typically indicated for the management of dyspnoea and lacks strong evidence for its efficacy in this context. Therefore, the morphine patch is the most appropriate and supported option for palliation of dyspnoea in this patient population.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}",
