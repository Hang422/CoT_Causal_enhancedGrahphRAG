Flutamide\nopb. Finasteride\nopc. Prazosin\nopd. Minoxidil\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nFinasteride is a 5α reductase inhibitor that effectively reduces dihydrotestosterone (DHT) levels, which is beneficial in treating both benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH) and male pattern baldness (androgenetic alopecia). The reasoning chains confirm that Finasteride improves urinary symptoms in BPH and promotes hair regrowth in male pattern baldness, aligning with established medical consensus. Other options, such as Flutamide, Prazosin, and Minoxidil, do not have this dual indication. Evidence paths further support Finasteride's role in treating androgenetic alopecia and BPH, confirming its effectiveness in both conditions.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The question asks for a 5α reductase inhibitor that is effective in both benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH) and male pattern baldness. Among the options provided, Finasteride (opb) is the only medication that fits this description. It works by inhibiting the enzyme 5α reductase, which leads to decreased levels of dihydrotestosterone (DHT), a hormone implicated in both conditions. Flutamide is an anti-androgen but not a 5α reductase inhibitor, Prazosin is an alpha-1 blocker used primarily for hypertension and BPH but does not affect DHT levels, and Minoxidil is a vasodilator used for hair regrowth but is not a 5α reductase inhibitor. Therefore, the best-supported option based on established medical knowledge is Finasteride, which is recognized for its dual efficacy in treating both BPH and male pattern baldness.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
