Vitamin A\nopb. Vitamin C\nopc. Vitamin D\nopd. Vitamin B12\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nVitamin D is well-supported in the literature for its role in enhancing insulin sensitivity, which can reduce the risk of insulin resistance, obesity, and metabolic syndrome. The reasoning chain for Vitamin D is consistent with consensus, as it directly links enhanced insulin sensitivity to lower obesity rates and decreased metabolic syndrome risk. In contrast, Vitamin C's antioxidant properties may reduce inflammation, but its impact on insulin resistance remains unclear, thus weakening its relevance. Vitamin A's role in immune function does not provide direct evidence for insulin resistance or obesity, making it less relevant. Vitamin B12 is essential for energy metabolism but lacks direct evidence linking it to insulin resistance or metabolic syndrome. Therefore, Vitamin D is the most relevant option supported by consensus and evidence.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The core medical principle here revolves around the role of vitamins in metabolic health, particularly their influence on insulin sensitivity and the risk of conditions like obesity and metabolic syndrome. Among the options provided, Vitamin D has been extensively studied and is well-supported in the literature for its role in enhancing insulin sensitivity. This enhancement is crucial in reducing the risk of insulin resistance, which is a key factor in the development of obesity and metabolic syndrome. In contrast, while Vitamin C has antioxidant properties that may help reduce inflammation, its direct impact on insulin resistance is less clear. Vitamin A primarily supports immune function and does not have a direct link to metabolic health. Vitamin B12 is important for energy metabolism but lacks evidence connecting it to insulin resistance or metabolic syndrome. Therefore, based on the consensus in the medical literature, Vitamin D is the most relevant and supported option for reducing the risk of insulin resistance, obesity, and metabolic syndrome.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opc\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}",
