Proprioception\nopb. Vibratory sense\nopc. Heat sensation\nopd. Touch\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nThe dorsal column of the spinal cord is responsible for transmitting proprioception, vibratory sense, and fine touch. It does not carry heat sensation, which is transmitted via the spinothalamic tract. Therefore, the correct answer to the question is that heat sensation is not carried in the dorsal column. The reasoning chains correctly identify that the dorsal column is involved in proprioception and touch while excluding heat sensation, aligning with established physiological consensus.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The dorsal column of the spinal cord is primarily responsible for transmitting proprioception, vibratory sense, and fine touch. These modalities are carried through the dorsal columns to the brain. In contrast, heat sensation is transmitted via the spinothalamic tract, which is responsible for carrying pain and temperature sensations. Therefore, the correct answer to the question is that heat sensation is not carried in the dorsal column. This conclusion aligns with established physiological knowledge and consensus in the field.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opc\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
