Propanolol\nopb. Aiprazolam\nopc. Buspirone\nopd. Haloperidol\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nPropranolol is primarily used for performance anxiety and reduces physical symptoms associated with anxiety, but it is not a first-line treatment for anxiety disorders. Alprazolam is a benzodiazepine commonly prescribed for anxiety disorders, making it a valid treatment option. Buspirone is an anxiolytic specifically indicated for generalized anxiety disorder, confirming its use in anxiety treatment. Haloperidol, an antipsychotic, is not primarily indicated for anxiety and is used for conditions like schizophrenia and acute psychosis, aligning with the consensus that it is not a treatment for anxiety. Therefore, the drug not used for anxiety is Haloperidol.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"In evaluating the options provided, we consider the primary uses of each medication in relation to anxiety. Propranolol (opa) is often used for performance anxiety and can help with the physical symptoms of anxiety, but it is not a first-line treatment for anxiety disorders. Alprazolam (opb) is a benzodiazepine that is widely prescribed for anxiety disorders, making it a valid treatment option. Buspirone (opc) is specifically indicated for generalized anxiety disorder, confirming its use in anxiety treatment. Haloperidol (opd), on the other hand, is an antipsychotic medication primarily used for treating schizophrenia and acute psychosis, and it is not indicated for anxiety disorders. Therefore, the drug that is not used for anxiety is Haloperidol. This conclusion aligns with the consensus in pharmacology regarding the treatment of anxiety disorders.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
