Ethanolamine oleate\nopb. Octreotide\nopc. Propanolol\nopd. Phytonadione\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nThe drug of choice for bleeding oesophageal varices is octreotide. It is a vasoactive drug that reduces portal pressure and splanchnic blood flow, effectively controlling variceal bleeding. This aligns with the consensus that octreotide is recommended for acute management of variceal hemorrhage. Ethanolamine oleate is used for sclerotherapy but is not first-line for acute bleeding. Propranolol is a beta-blocker used for the prevention of variceal bleeding, not for acute management. Phytonadione (vitamin K) is used for coagulopathy but does not specifically address variceal bleeding. Evidence supports that octreotide treats acute hemorrhage associated with portal hypertension, confirming its role in managing bleeding oesophageal varices.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The management of bleeding oesophageal varices primarily involves the use of vasoactive drugs to reduce portal pressure and control bleeding. Octreotide is a somatostatin analogue that effectively decreases splanchnic blood flow and portal pressure, making it the drug of choice for acute variceal hemorrhage. Ethanolamine oleate is used for sclerotherapy but is not the first-line treatment for acute bleeding. Propranolol is effective for the prevention of variceal bleeding but not for acute management. Phytonadione is used for vitamin K deficiency and does not directly address variceal bleeding. Therefore, based on the consensus in medical literature, octreotide is the most appropriate choice for the acute management of bleeding oesophageal varices.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
