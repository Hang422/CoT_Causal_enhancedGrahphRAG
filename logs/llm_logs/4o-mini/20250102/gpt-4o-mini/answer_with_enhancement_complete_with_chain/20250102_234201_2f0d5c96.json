Cough suppression\nopb. Anti-emesis\nopc. Miosis\nopd. Truncal rigidity\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nOpioids are known for several pharmacological actions. They effectively suppress cough (cough suppression), which is a recognized action of opioids. They can also induce nausea, but they are sometimes used in anti-emetic contexts, although this is not their primary use. Miosis, or pupil constriction, is a well-documented effect of opioids. Truncal rigidity, while a possible side effect of opioids, is not considered a primary pharmacological action. Therefore, the option that is NOT a pharmacological action of opioids is 'anti-emesis,' as it is not primarily associated with their therapeutic use, despite some overlap with nausea management.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Opioids are known for several pharmacological actions, including cough suppression (opa), miosis (opc), and truncal rigidity (opd). Cough suppression is a recognized therapeutic use of opioids, particularly in cases of severe cough. Miosis, or pupil constriction, is a classic sign of opioid use. Truncal rigidity can occur as a side effect, especially at higher doses or with certain opioids, but it is not a primary therapeutic action. The option 'anti-emesis' (opb) is less commonly associated with opioids; while opioids can induce nausea, they are not primarily used for anti-emetic purposes. Therefore, the best-supported option that is NOT a pharmacological action of opioids is 'anti-emesis.'\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
