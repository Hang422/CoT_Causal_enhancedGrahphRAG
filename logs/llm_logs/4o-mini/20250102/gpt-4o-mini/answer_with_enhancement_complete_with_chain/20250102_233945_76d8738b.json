None of the above\nopb. Albumin\nopc. Globulins\nopd. Chylomicrons\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nFree fatty acids are primarily transported in the bloodstream by binding to albumin, which facilitates their delivery to tissues, including the mitochondria, for oxidation. This is supported by the consensus that albumin is a major transport protein for non-esterified fatty acids. Other options, such as globulins and chylomicrons, do not play a significant role in the transport of free fatty acids for mitochondrial oxidation. Therefore, the correct answer is that free fatty acids are transported by albumin.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

Albumin serves as the main carrier for non-esterified fatty acids, facilitating their transport to various tissues, including those that require fatty acids for oxidation in the mitochondria. Other options such as globulins and chylomicrons do not play a significant role in this specific transport process. Therefore, based on the consensus in the field, the most likely correct answer is that free fatty acids are transported by albumin.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
