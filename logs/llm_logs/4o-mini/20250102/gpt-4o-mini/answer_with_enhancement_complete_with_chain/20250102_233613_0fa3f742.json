Thiamine\nopb. Pyridoxine\nopc. Niacin\nopd. Riboflavin\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nIsoniazid (INH) can induce peripheral neuropathy primarily due to its interference with vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) metabolism, leading to a deficiency. Pyridoxine is crucial for nerve function, and its supplementation is recommended to prevent and treat INH-induced neuropathy. The reasoning chains consistently support that pyridoxine supplementation is effective in alleviating neuropathy symptoms associated with INH treatment. Evidence paths confirm that pyridoxine treats neuropathy and is associated with correcting vitamin B6 deficiency caused by isoniazid. Therefore, the best treatment for INH-induced neuropathy is pyridoxine.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Isoniazid (INH) is known to cause peripheral neuropathy primarily due to its interference with vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) metabolism. This leads to a deficiency of pyridoxine, which is essential for proper nerve function. The consensus in the medical community is that pyridoxine supplementation is effective in preventing and treating INH-induced neuropathy. Other options such as thiamine, niacin, and riboflavin do not have the same direct relationship with INH-induced neuropathy as pyridoxine does. Therefore, the best-supported treatment for INH-induced neuropathy is pyridoxine supplementation.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
