Contraction of gall bladder\nopb. Secretion of pancreatic juice rich in enzymes\nopc. Increases the secretion of enterokinase\nopd. All\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nCholecystokinin (CCK) is a hormone that plays several key roles in digestion. It is known to stimulate gallbladder contraction, leading to the release of bile into the intestine, which aids in fat digestion. Additionally, CCK stimulates pancreatic acinar cells to secrete pancreatic juice rich in digestive enzymes, enhancing nutrient digestion. While CCK is involved in the activation of trypsinogen to trypsin through the action of enteropeptidase (also known as enterokinase), it does not directly increase the secretion of enteropeptidase itself. Therefore, the correct answer is 'All' (option d), as CCK's actions include gallbladder contraction and secretion of pancreatic juice, but the specific role regarding enteropeptidase should be clarified as indirect. The reasoning chains for options a and b are correct, while option c is misleading in implying a direct action of CCK on enteropeptidase secretion.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Cholecystokinin (CCK) is a hormone that has well-established roles in digestion. It stimulates the contraction of the gallbladder (option a), leading to the release of bile, which is essential for fat digestion. Additionally, CCK promotes the secretion of pancreatic juice rich in digestive enzymes (option b), which aids in the digestion of nutrients. However, while CCK is involved in the activation of trypsinogen to trypsin through enteropeptidase (enterokinase), it does not directly increase the secretion of enteropeptidase itself (option c). Therefore, while options a and b are correct, option c is misleading. Given that options a and b are accurate actions of CCK, but option c does not correctly represent a direct action of CCK, the best-supported answer is not 'All' (option d). Thus, the most accurate answer is that CCK is involved in gallbladder contraction and pancreatic enzyme secretion, but not in increasing enteropeptidase secretion directly. Therefore, the best answer is 'Contraction of gall bladder' (option a) and 'Secretion of pancreatic juice rich in enzymes' (option b), but not 'All'. The complexity arises from the indirect role of CCK regarding enteropeptidase, leading to a nuanced understanding of its actions. Hence, I will select option 'opb' as the most directly supported action of CCK.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
