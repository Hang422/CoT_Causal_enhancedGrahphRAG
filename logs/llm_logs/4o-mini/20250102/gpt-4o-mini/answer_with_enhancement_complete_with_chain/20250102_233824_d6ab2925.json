Methimazole\nopb. Propylthiouraril\nopc. Carbimazole\nopd. Perchlorate\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nIn the management of hyperthyroidism during the first trimester of pregnancy, Propylthiouracil (PTU) is the preferred choice due to its better safety profile compared to Methimazole, which is associated with teratogenic effects. Methimazole is a pro-drug of Carbimazole, and both are less favorable in early pregnancy due to potential risks to fetal development. Perchlorate is not commonly used in this context. The consensus supports the use of Propylthiouracil as the safest option for treating hyperthyroidism in pregnant patients during the first trimester.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "
