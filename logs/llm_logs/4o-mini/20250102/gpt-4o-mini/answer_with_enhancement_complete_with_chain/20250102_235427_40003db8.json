Heparin sulfate\nopb. Protamine sulfate\nopc. Low molecular weight heparin\nopd. Warfarin\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nCancer surgery significantly increases the risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE), and prophylaxis is essential to prevent thromboembolic events. Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) is the anticoagulant of choice for VTE prophylaxis in patients undergoing cancer surgery, as supported by clinical guidelines. Heparin sulfate, while an anticoagulant, is not preferred for prophylaxis due to its short duration of action and requirement for monitoring. Warfarin, although effective, has a delayed onset and requires monitoring, making it unsuitable for immediate post-surgical prophylaxis. Protamine sulfate is an antidote for heparin and does not possess anticoagulant properties, thus is not applicable for prophylaxis. Therefore, the consensus strongly supports the use of low molecular weight heparin for this indication.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"In the context of cancer surgery, patients are at a significantly increased risk for venous thromboembolism (VTE). The standard medical consensus recommends the use of low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) for prophylaxis in these patients due to its efficacy, ease of use, and favorable pharmacokinetic profile. LMWH provides effective anticoagulation with a predictable response, does not require routine monitoring, and has a lower risk of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia compared to unfractionated heparin. Heparin sulfate is not preferred for prophylaxis due to its short duration of action and need for monitoring. Warfarin, while effective for long-term anticoagulation, is not suitable for immediate post-surgical prophylaxis due to its delayed onset and requirement for INR monitoring. Protamine sulfate is an antidote for heparin and does not serve as an anticoagulant. Therefore, the best-supported option for VTE prophylaxis in patients undergoing cancer surgery is low molecular weight heparin.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opc\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
