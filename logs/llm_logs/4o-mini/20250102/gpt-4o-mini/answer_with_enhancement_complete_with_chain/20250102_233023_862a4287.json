Anti depressants\nopb. Anti psychotics\nopc. Anti epileptics\nopd. Mood stabilizers\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nSchizophrenia is primarily treated with anti-psychotics, which are effective in managing the core psychotic symptoms of the disorder. While mood disturbances can occur in schizophrenia, mood stabilizers are not considered first-line treatments; anti-psychotics are preferred. Anti-depressants may be used for comorbid conditions but are not the primary treatment for schizophrenia. Anti-epileptics are also not standard treatment for schizophrenia, despite some cases involving seizures. Overall, the consensus strongly supports the use of anti-psychotics as the mainstay of treatment for schizophrenia.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Schizophrenia is primarily characterized by symptoms such as delusions, hallucinations, and disorganized thinking. The mainstay of treatment for these symptoms is anti-psychotic medications, which are specifically designed to target the dopaminergic system and alleviate psychotic symptoms. While anti-depressants may be used for co-occurring depressive symptoms, they do not address the core symptoms of schizophrenia. Similarly, anti-epileptics and mood stabilizers are not standard treatments for schizophrenia, although they may have roles in managing specific symptoms or comorbid conditions. Therefore, the consensus in the medical community strongly supports the use of anti-psychotics as the primary treatment for schizophrenia. Based on this reasoning, the most appropriate answer is option 'opb'.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
