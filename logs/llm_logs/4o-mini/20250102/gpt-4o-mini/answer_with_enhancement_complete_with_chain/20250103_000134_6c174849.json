Protein linked with glycosidic bond\nopb. Core protein\nopc. Sugar residues are long in carbohydrate poion of glycoprotein\nopd. None\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nGlycoproteins are biomolecules that consist of a protein core linked to carbohydrate moieties via glycosidic bonds. The core protein is essential for the structure and function of glycoproteins, and sugar residues can vary in length, with some being long. Therefore, the characteristics of glycoproteins include: 1) they contain a protein linked with glycosidic bonds, 2) they have a core protein, and 3) they possess sugar residues that can vary in length. The option 'None' is incorrect as glycoproteins have distinct characteristics that are well-defined in biochemistry.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Glycoproteins are indeed characterized by their structure, which includes a protein core linked to carbohydrate moieties through glycosidic bonds. The core protein is fundamental to the glycoprotein's function and structure. Additionally, the carbohydrate portion can vary in length, which is consistent with the enhanced information provided. Therefore, options 'opa' (Protein linked with glycosidic bond) and 'opb' (Core protein) are both correct characteristics of glycoproteins. Option 'opc' (Sugar residues are long in carbohydrate portion of glycoprotein) is also a valid statement, as sugar residues can vary in length. However, since the question asks for characteristics of glycoproteins and does not specify to choose only one, the best-supported option that encompasses the essential characteristics is 'opa' or 'opb'. Given that 'opa' is a more direct description of the glycoprotein structure, I will select that as the final answer. The option 'None' is incorrect as glycoproteins have well-defined characteristics.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}",
