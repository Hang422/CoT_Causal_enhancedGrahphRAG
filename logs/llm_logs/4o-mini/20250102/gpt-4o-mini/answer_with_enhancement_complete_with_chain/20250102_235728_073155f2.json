Platelet dysfunction\nopb. Aspirin inhibits the action of heparin\nopc. Enhanced hypersensitivity of heparin\nopd. Therapy of heparin cannot be monitored\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nAspirin is an antiplatelet agent that inhibits platelet aggregation, leading to increased bleeding risk. This is particularly concerning in patients already on heparin, an anticoagulant, as the combination can significantly heighten the risk of hemorrhage. The reasoning chains correctly highlight that aspirin causes platelet dysfunction, which complicates heparin therapy due to the potential for increased bleeding. The evidence paths support the interaction between aspirin and heparin, emphasizing the risk of hemorrhage associated with aspirin use. Therefore, the primary reason aspirin is not given to patients on heparin is due to its potential to cause platelet dysfunction and increase bleeding risk, rather than any direct inhibition of heparin's action or monitoring issues.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Aspirin is an antiplatelet medication that inhibits platelet aggregation, which can lead to an increased risk of bleeding. When a patient is already on heparin, an anticoagulant, the addition of aspirin can significantly heighten the risk of hemorrhage due to the combined effects of both medications on hemostasis. The primary concern is that aspirin causes platelet dysfunction, which complicates the management of patients on heparin. The other options do not accurately reflect the interaction between aspirin and heparin: aspirin does not inhibit the action of heparin, it does not enhance hypersensitivity to heparin, and the therapy of heparin can still be monitored despite the use of aspirin. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is that aspirin causes platelet dysfunction, leading to increased bleeding risk in patients already on heparin.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}",
