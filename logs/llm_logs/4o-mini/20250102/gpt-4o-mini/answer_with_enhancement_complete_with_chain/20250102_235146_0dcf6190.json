Clindamycin\nopb. Erythromycin\nopc. Ampicillin\nopd. Metronidazole\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nBacterial vaginosis (BV) is a common vaginal infection characterized by an imbalance of normal vaginal flora, primarily involving a decrease in Lactobacillus and an increase in anaerobic bacteria such as Prevotella. The first-line treatment for BV is Metronidazole, which is effective against anaerobic bacteria and has been well-studied for this condition. Clindamycin is an alternative treatment but is not preferred as the first-line option. Erythromycin and Ampicillin are not typically used for BV and are less effective compared to Metronidazole. Clinical guidelines consistently recommend Metronidazole as the primary treatment for bacterial vaginosis.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "
