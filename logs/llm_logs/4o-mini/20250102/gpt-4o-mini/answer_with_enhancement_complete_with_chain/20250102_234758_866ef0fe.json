It is more common with huminsulin\nopb. It may occur in the presence of infections\nopc. It may be due to antibodies to insulin\nopd. Use of glucocorticoids may be useful in severe cases\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nInsulin resistance is a key feature of type 2 diabetes and is often associated with various factors. The statement regarding human insulin being more common in insulin resistance is misleading; while insulin resistance can occur in patients treated with human insulin, it is not inherently more common with this form of insulin compared to others. Insulin resistance can indeed occur during infections, which is a true statement. The idea that insulin resistance may be due to antibodies to insulin is possible but not a common cause, thus making this statement less reliable. Finally, the use of glucocorticoids is known to worsen insulin resistance rather than being useful in severe cases, contradicting the claim. Therefore, the correct answer is that the use of glucocorticoids may be useful in severe cases, as this is not true based on consensus.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Insulin resistance is a complex condition often seen in diabetic patients, particularly in type 2 diabetes. The statements provided need to be evaluated based on established medical knowledge. The first statement (opa) suggests that insulin resistance is more common with human insulin; however, this is misleading as insulin resistance can occur with any type of insulin and is not specifically more common with human insulin. The second statement (opb) is true, as infections can indeed exacerbate insulin resistance. The third statement (opc) suggests that insulin resistance may be due to antibodies to insulin; while this can occur, it is not a common cause of insulin resistance in the general population. The final statement (opd) claims that glucocorticoids may be useful in severe cases of insulin resistance, which is incorrect, as glucocorticoids are known to worsen insulin resistance. Therefore, the statement that is not true is that glucocorticoids may be useful in severe cases (opd). This aligns with the consensus that glucocorticoids exacerbate insulin resistance rather than alleviate it. Thus, the best-supported answer is option opd.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
