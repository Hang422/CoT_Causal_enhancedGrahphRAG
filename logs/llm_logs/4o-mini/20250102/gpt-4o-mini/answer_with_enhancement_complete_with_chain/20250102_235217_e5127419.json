Hypoglycemia\nopb. Cinchonism\nopc. Arrhythmias\nopd. Sweating\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nThe administration of i.v. quinine can lead to a condition known as Cinchonism, which is characterized by symptoms such as restlessness, sweating, tinnitus, and headache. The reasoning chains indicate that both restlessness and sweating are common manifestations of Cinchonism, making it the most likely cause in this scenario. While hypoglycemia and arrhythmias are potential concerns with quinine, they are less directly associated with the specific symptoms of restlessness and sweating. Therefore, the best-supported conclusion is that the symptoms are primarily due to Cinchonism, aligning with established pharmacological consensus.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The symptoms of restlessness and sweating following the administration of i.v. quinine are most consistent with Cinchonism, a known side effect of quinine. Cinchonism can present with a variety of symptoms including tinnitus, headache, and gastrointestinal disturbances, but restlessness and sweating are particularly noted. While hypoglycemia and arrhythmias are potential complications associated with quinine, they do not directly correlate with the specific symptoms presented in this case. Therefore, based on established pharmacological knowledge and the enhanced information provided, Cinchonism is the most likely cause of the symptoms observed in the patient.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}",
