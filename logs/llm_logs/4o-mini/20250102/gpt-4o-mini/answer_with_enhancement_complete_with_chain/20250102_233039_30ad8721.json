Imiquimod\nopb. Podophylline\nopc. Interferon\nopd. Acyclovir\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nImiquimod is a topical immunomodulator specifically indicated for the treatment of genital warts. The reasoning chains confirm that while Podophylline is a topical treatment, it is not classified as an immunomodulator. Acyclovir is an antiviral medication used for herpes virus infections and is not relevant for genital warts. Interferon is not typically used topically for this condition. Therefore, the correct option is Imiquimod, which acts by enhancing the immune response against the wart-causing virus. The evidence paths support the role of Imiquimod as an immunologic adjuvant, reinforcing its use in treating genital warts.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The question asks for a topical immunomodulator used for the treatment of genital warts. Among the options provided, Imiquimod is well-established as a topical immunomodulator that enhances the immune response against the human papillomavirus (HPV), which is responsible for genital warts. Podophylline, while a topical treatment for genital warts, does not function as an immunomodulator; it acts as a cytotoxic agent. Acyclovir is an antiviral medication primarily used for herpes simplex virus infections and is not indicated for genital warts. Interferon is not typically used topically for this condition. Therefore, the most appropriate and supported option is Imiquimod, as it directly aligns with the definition of a topical immunomodulator and its specific indication for genital warts. Based on this reasoning, I am confident in the choice.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
