Stomach\nopb. Duodenum\nopc. Ileum\nopd. Duodenum + Jejunum\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nIron absorption primarily occurs in the duodenum, which is the first part of the small intestine. While the jejunum also plays a role in iron absorption, the majority of iron is absorbed in the duodenum. This is supported by the consensus that the duodenum is a key site for nutrient absorption, particularly for iron. Therefore, the most accurate answer is that iron is absorbed in the duodenum, with some contribution from the jejunum. The evidence paths confirm the importance of the duodenum in iron absorption, while the jejunum's role is secondary.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Iron absorption primarily occurs in the duodenum, which is the first segment of the small intestine. While the jejunum can also contribute to iron absorption, the consensus in medical literature indicates that the duodenum is the primary site for this process. Given the options provided, the best-supported answer is 'Duodenum + Jejunum' (option opd), as it acknowledges the role of both segments, with the duodenum being the predominant site. However, since the question specifically asks where iron is absorbed, the most accurate single answer would be 'Duodenum' (option opb). Therefore, while option opd is more comprehensive, option opb is the most precise in terms of primary absorption location.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
