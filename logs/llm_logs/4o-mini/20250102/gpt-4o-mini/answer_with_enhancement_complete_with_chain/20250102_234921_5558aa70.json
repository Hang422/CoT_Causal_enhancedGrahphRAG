Propanolol\nopb. Oral contraceptives\nopc. Reserpine\nopd. Flupenthixol\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nPropranolol is primarily used for anxiety and is not typically associated with depression, making it the least likely option to cause depressive symptoms. Oral contraceptives can influence mood due to hormonal changes, and while some users may experience depression, it is not a common side effect. Reserpine is known to deplete monoamines, which are crucial for mood regulation, and is associated with causing depressive symptoms. Flupenthixol, an antipsychotic, can also lead to depressive symptoms, making it a potential cause of depression. Therefore, the best-supported conclusion is that depression is not a side effect of Propranolol.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"To determine which option is least likely to cause depression, we analyze each medication: Propranolol (opa) is a beta-blocker primarily used for anxiety and hypertension, and while it can have some mood effects, it is not commonly associated with depression. Oral contraceptives (opb) can influence mood due to hormonal changes, and while some users report depressive symptoms, it is not a universal side effect. Reserpine (opc) is known to deplete monoamines, which are critical for mood regulation, and is well-documented to cause depression. Flupenthixol (opd), an antipsychotic, can also lead to depressive symptoms. Given this analysis, Propranolol is the least likely to cause depression compared to the other options, which have stronger associations with depressive symptoms. Therefore, the best-supported conclusion is that depression is not a side effect of Propranolol.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}",
