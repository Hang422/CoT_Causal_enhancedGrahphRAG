Acute renal failure\nopb. Development of antiplatelet antibodies\nopc. Encephalitis secondary to liver dysfunction\nopd. Hemorrhagic stroke\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nFibrinolytic drugs, used in the treatment of acute myocardial infarction, significantly increase the risk of bleeding complications due to their mechanism of action, which involves the dissolution of thrombi and restoration of blood flow. The most serious adverse effect associated with this therapy is hemorrhagic stroke, as evidenced by multiple reasoning chains indicating a direct correlation between fibrinolytic therapy and increased bleeding risk, particularly intracranial hemorrhage. The consensus in medical literature supports that the likelihood of hemorrhagic stroke is notably elevated in patients receiving fibrinolytics, making it the most probable adverse effect in this context.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Fibrinolytic drugs are used in the treatment of acute myocardial infarction to dissolve blood clots and restore blood flow. However, their use is associated with a significant risk of bleeding complications due to their mechanism of action. Among the potential adverse effects listed, hemorrhagic stroke is the most serious and well-documented complication associated with fibrinolytic therapy. The enhanced information supports this by indicating a direct correlation between fibrinolytic therapy and increased risk of intracranial hemorrhage. Other options, such as acute renal failure, development of antiplatelet antibodies, and encephalitis secondary to liver dysfunction, are not commonly associated with fibrinolytic therapy. Therefore, based on medical consensus and the enhanced information provided, the most likely adverse effect to occur with the use of fibrinolytic drugs in acute myocardial infarction is hemorrhagic stroke.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
