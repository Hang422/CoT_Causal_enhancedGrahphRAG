Quinine\nopb. Chloroquine\nopc. Mefloquine\nopd. Atovaquone\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nChloroquine is well-documented to cause retinal toxicity, leading to retinal pigmentation changes, making it the most relevant option for retinal pigmentation among the choices. Quinine has possible retinal effects, but its impact on pigmentation is unclear and less established. Mefloquine is primarily associated with neuropsychiatric side effects and has no established link to retinal pigmentation. Atovaquone is known for its antimalarial action but has no known retinal toxicity. Therefore, the most consensus-supported cause of retinal pigmentation is Chloroquine.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Chloroquine is well-documented in the medical literature as a drug that can cause retinal toxicity, specifically leading to changes in retinal pigmentation. This is a recognized side effect due to its accumulation in retinal tissues, which can result in a condition known as chloroquine retinopathy. While quinine has some potential retinal effects, its association with pigmentation changes is not as clearly established as that of chloroquine. Mefloquine and atovaquone do not have significant links to retinal pigmentation or toxicity. Therefore, based on the consensus in pharmacology and the enhanced information provided, chloroquine is the most likely cause of retinal pigmentation among the options listed.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
