Clindamycin\nopb. Cefepime\nopc. Metronidazole\nopd. Azithromycin\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nThe drug of choice for gonococcal urethritis is ceftriaxone, which is a first-line cephalosporin antibiotic. For non-gonococcal urethritis, azithromycin is commonly recommended due to its effectiveness against Chlamydia. While cefepime is also a cephalosporin, it is not first-line for urethritis. Therefore, azithromycin is the preferred choice for non-gonococcal urethritis, but it is not the drug of choice for gonococcal urethritis. The consensus indicates that ceftriaxone is the standard treatment for gonococcal urethritis, while azithromycin is effective for non-gonococcal cases.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The question asks for the drug of choice for both gonococcal and non-gonococcal urethritis. Gonococcal urethritis is primarily treated with ceftriaxone, while non-gonococcal urethritis is typically treated with azithromycin, especially for infections caused by Chlamydia. The options provided include clindamycin, cefepime, metronidazole, and azithromycin. Clindamycin and metronidazole are not standard treatments for either type of urethritis. Cefepime is not the first-line treatment for urethritis. Azithromycin is effective for non-gonococcal urethritis but not for gonococcal urethritis. Therefore, while azithromycin is the best option for non-gonococcal urethritis, there is no single drug that serves as the drug of choice for both types of urethritis. However, given the options, azithromycin is the most appropriate choice for non-gonococcal urethritis, which is a common condition. Thus, the best-supported option is azithromycin, despite it not being the drug of choice for gonococcal urethritis.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}",
