Monotherapy for acute episodes\nopb. Monitoring of serum concentration is not useful for guiding dose adjustment\nopc. Can result in leucocytosis\nopd. Can result in hypehyroidism on long term use\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nLithium is indeed used as a treatment for bipolar disorder, particularly effective for acute manic episodes, and can be used as monotherapy for these episodes. Monitoring serum concentration of lithium is crucial for guiding dose adjustments to ensure efficacy and safety, contradicting the claim that it is not useful. While lithium can affect blood cell counts, leucocytosis is a possible but not commonly reported side effect. Long-term use of lithium is associated with hypothyroidism, while hyperthyroidism is less common and not a standard risk. Therefore, the true statement regarding lithium in maniac-depressive psychosis is that it can be used as monotherapy for acute episodes.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Lithium is a well-established treatment for bipolar disorder, particularly effective for managing acute manic episodes. It can indeed be used as monotherapy for these episodes, which aligns with the consensus in psychiatric pharmacology. Monitoring serum lithium levels is critical for ensuring therapeutic efficacy and avoiding toxicity, making option opb incorrect. While lithium can affect blood cell counts, leucocytosis is not a common side effect, and the more recognized risk with long-term use is hypothyroidism rather than hyperthyroidism. Therefore, the most accurate statement regarding the use of lithium in maniac-depressive psychosis is that it can be used as monotherapy for acute episodes. This leads to the conclusion that option opa is the correct choice.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}",
