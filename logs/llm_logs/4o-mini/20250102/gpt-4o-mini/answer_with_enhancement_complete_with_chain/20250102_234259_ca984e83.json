Single dose in ascariasis\nopb. Immunostimulant\nopc. Paralysis of worms by depolarisation\nopd. Immunodepressant in high doses\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nLevamisole is primarily an anthelmintic agent used to treat infections like ascariasis, typically administered in a single dose. It acts by causing paralysis of worms through a depolarization mechanism, which is effective against certain helminths. While Levamisole has immunostimulant properties and can enhance immune response, it is not primarily used as an immunodepressant; however, high doses can lead to immunosuppression, which is a conflicting use. Therefore, the option stating that Levamisole is used as an immunodepressant in high doses is incorrect, as this is not its primary indication.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Levamisole is primarily known as an anthelmintic agent used to treat infections such as ascariasis, typically administered in a single dose (option opa). It works by causing paralysis of worms through a depolarization mechanism (option opc). Additionally, Levamisole has immunostimulant properties, enhancing the immune response (option opb). However, while it can lead to immunosuppression at high doses, this is not its primary use, and thus, it is not correct to classify it as an immunodepressant (option opd). Therefore, the option that Levamisole is used as an immunodepressant in high doses is the exception among the listed uses.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}",
