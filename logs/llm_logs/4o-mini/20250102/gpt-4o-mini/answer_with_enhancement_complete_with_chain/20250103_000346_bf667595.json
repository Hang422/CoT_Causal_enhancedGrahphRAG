Vasopressin\nopb. Terlipressin\nopc. Desmopressin\nopd. Pralipressin\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nNeurogenic diabetes insipidus is characterized by insufficient production of antidiuretic hormone (ADH), leading to excessive urination. The drug of choice for this condition is Desmopressin, a synthetic analog of vasopressin (ADH), which effectively mimics its action and reduces urine output. Desmopressin is preferred due to its efficacy and safety profile compared to other vasopressin analogs. While vasopressin itself can be used, Desmopressin is more effective in managing the symptoms of neurogenic diabetes insipidus. The evidence supports that Desmopressin is the most appropriate treatment option for this condition.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Neurogenic diabetes insipidus is caused by a deficiency of antidiuretic hormone (ADH), leading to excessive urination. The primary treatment for this condition is aimed at replacing or mimicking the action of ADH. Desmopressin is a synthetic analog of vasopressin that has a longer duration of action and is more effective in reducing urine output in patients with neurogenic diabetes insipidus. While vasopressin can be used, Desmopressin is preferred due to its better safety profile and efficacy. Other options like terlipressin and pralipressin are not typically used for this specific condition. Therefore, the consensus in the medical community supports Desmopressin as the drug of choice for neurogenic diabetes insipidus.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opc\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
