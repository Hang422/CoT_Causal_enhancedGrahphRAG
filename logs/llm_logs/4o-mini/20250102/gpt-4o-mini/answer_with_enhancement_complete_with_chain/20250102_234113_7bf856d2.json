Loxatidine\nopb. Pirenzepine\nopc. Omeprazole\nopd. Famotidine\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nLoxatidine is an H2 receptor antagonist that reduces gastric acid secretion but does not block cholinergic, histaminergic, or gastrin receptors, making it a potential candidate. However, it primarily blocks H2 receptors, which does not align with the requirement to block both basal and stimulated gastric acid secretion without affecting these receptors. Pirenzepine blocks M1 muscarinic receptors and does not meet the criteria as it does not block H2 receptors. Omeprazole inhibits the proton pump, effectively blocking stimulated gastric acid secretion, and does not affect cholinergic, histaminergic, or gastrin receptors, making it a strong candidate. Famotidine, like Loxatidine, blocks H2 receptors and reduces gastric acid secretion but does not meet the requirement of blocking both basal and stimulated secretion without affecting other receptors. Therefore, the best option is Omeprazole, as it aligns with the criteria of blocking gastric acid secretion without affecting the specified receptors.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"To determine the drug that blocks both basal and stimulated gastric acid secretion without affecting cholinergic, histaminergic, or gastrin receptors, we need to analyze the options provided. Loxatidine and Famotidine are both H2 receptor antagonists, which primarily block H2 receptors and do not meet the requirement of not affecting these receptors. Pirenzepine, on the other hand, is an M1 muscarinic receptor antagonist and does not block H2 receptors, thus it does not fulfill the requirement either. Omeprazole, a proton pump inhibitor, effectively inhibits the final step of gastric acid secretion and does not interact with cholinergic, histaminergic, or gastrin receptors. Therefore, it is the only drug among the options that meets the criteria of blocking both basal and stimulated gastric acid secretion without affecting the specified receptors. Based on this analysis, Omeprazole is the best-supported option.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opc\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}",
