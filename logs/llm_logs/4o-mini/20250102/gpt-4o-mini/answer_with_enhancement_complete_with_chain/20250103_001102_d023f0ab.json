HDL\nopb. LDL\nopc. VLDL\nopd. Chylomicrons\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nCholesterol is synthesized in the liver and needs to be transported to peripheral tissues. The primary carrier of cholesterol in the bloodstream is Low-Density Lipoprotein (LDL), which delivers cholesterol to cells. While Very Low-Density Lipoprotein (VLDL) primarily carries triglycerides, it is converted to LDL after triglyceride removal, further supporting LDL's role in cholesterol transport. High-Density Lipoprotein (HDL) primarily functions to remove excess cholesterol from tissues rather than transport it from the liver. Chylomicrons are involved in transporting dietary lipids rather than liver-derived cholesterol. Therefore, the correct answer is LDL, as it is the main transporter of cholesterol from the liver to peripheral tissues.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

While High-Density Lipoprotein (HDL) plays a role in reverse cholesterol transport, it does not primarily transport cholesterol from the liver to tissues.
