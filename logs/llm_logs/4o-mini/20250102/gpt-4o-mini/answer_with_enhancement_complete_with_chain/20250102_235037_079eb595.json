Pyrazinamide\nopb. Isoniazid\nopc. Ethambutol\nopd. Rifampicin\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nIn HIV positive patients on zidovudine, lamivudine, and indinavir therapy who develop TB, Rifampicin is avoided due to its potent induction of CYP450 enzymes, which can significantly decrease the plasma levels of zidovudine and lamivudine, leading to a risk of treatment failure or increased toxicity. Isoniazid and Ethambutol are generally considered safe in this context, while Pyrazinamide may have some interactions but is less concerning than Rifampicin. Therefore, the consensus is that Rifampicin poses the greatest risk of adverse drug interactions in this scenario.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"In HIV positive patients receiving antiretroviral therapy, particularly with zidovudine, lamivudine, and indinavir, the choice of anti-tubercular drugs must consider potential drug interactions. Rifampicin is known to be a potent inducer of CYP450 enzymes, which can significantly lower the plasma concentrations of zidovudine and lamivudine, leading to reduced efficacy of the HIV treatment and potential treatment failure. While Isoniazid and Ethambutol are generally safe to use in this context, Pyrazinamide may have some interactions but is less concerning than Rifampicin. Therefore, the consensus is clear that Rifampicin should be avoided in this scenario due to its significant impact on the metabolism of the antiretroviral drugs. Thus, the most appropriate answer is that Rifampicin is the drug to avoid.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
