Its primary role is to stimulate the pancreas to secrete bicarbonate, which helps to neutralize gastric acid in the small intestine. While it also has effects on gastric secretion and the pyloric sphincter, its most significant action is related to bicarbonate secretion.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opb\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}",
