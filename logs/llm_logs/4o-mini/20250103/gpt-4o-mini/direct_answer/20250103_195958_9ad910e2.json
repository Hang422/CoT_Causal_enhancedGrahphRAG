  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"The respiratory center is primarily located in the medulla oblongata and pons, not the midbrain. It is directly stimulated by a fall in PaO2, but this is not the primary driver for respiration; the primary driver is usually a rise in PaCO2. The respiratory center is connected with the cardiac center, and it is inhibited during swallowing to prevent aspiration. Therefore, the most accurate statement is that it is directly stimulated by a fall in PaO2, but this is not the primary mechanism of respiratory drive.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opa\",\n    \"confidence\": 70\n}",
