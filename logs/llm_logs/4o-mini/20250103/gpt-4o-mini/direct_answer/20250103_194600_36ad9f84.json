  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"In herpes simplex encephalitis, the primary treatment is acyclovir, which is an antiviral medication effective against herpes viruses. Vidarabine is also used but is less common than acyclovir. Ganciclovir is primarily used for cytomegalovirus infections and is not typically indicated for herpes simplex encephalitis. Amantadine is an antiviral that is not effective against herpes viruses and is used primarily for influenza and Parkinson's disease.
