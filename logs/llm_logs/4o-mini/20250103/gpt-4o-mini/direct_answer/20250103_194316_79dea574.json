  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"The symptoms of vomiting, lethargy, and severe jaundice in a 6-month-old baby after the introduction of fruit juice suggest a metabolic disorder related to carbohydrate metabolism. The introduction of fruit juice, which contains fructose, points towards a potential issue with fructose metabolism. Aldolase B is the enzyme responsible for the breakdown of fructose in the liver, and its deficiency leads to hereditary fructose intolerance, which can present with the symptoms described. Therefore, the defective enzyme is likely Aldolase B.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opc\",\n    \"confidence\": 90\n}",
