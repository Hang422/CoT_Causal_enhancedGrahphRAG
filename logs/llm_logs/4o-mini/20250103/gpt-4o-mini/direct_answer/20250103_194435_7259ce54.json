  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Dobutamine is a synthetic catecholamine that primarily acts as a beta-1 adrenergic agonist, leading to increased cardiac output with less effect on heart rate compared to dopamine. Unlike dopamine, dobutamine does not activate peripheral dopaminergic receptors, which is a key distinction. Therefore, option opd is correct.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opd\",\n    \"confidence\": 90\n}",
