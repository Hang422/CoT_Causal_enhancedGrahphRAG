  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Protease activated receptors (PARs) are indeed a family of seven transmembrane proteins and are activated by thrombin. They are known to play a role in various physiological processes, including the release of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and providing protection to epithelial cells. Therefore, all the statements are true, but the statement about releasing PGE2 is less direct as PARs primarily mediate signaling that can lead to PGE2 release rather than directly releasing it themselves. However, the statement that is least accurate in the context of PARs is that they 'protect epithelial cells' as this is not a primary function attributed to them. Thus, the correct answer is that they do not primarily protect epithelial cells.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opd\",\n    \"confidence\": 85\n}",
