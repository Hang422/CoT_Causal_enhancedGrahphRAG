  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"The HMP shunt, also known as the pentose phosphate pathway, is active in various tissues for nucleotide synthesis and NADPH production. However, red blood cells (RBCs) rely primarily on glycolysis and do not utilize the HMP shunt significantly, as they lack mitochondria and primarily function in anaerobic metabolism. Therefore, the HMP shunt is not prominent in RBCs compared to other tissues like the liver, adipose tissue, and brain.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opc\",\n    \"confidence\": 90\n}",
