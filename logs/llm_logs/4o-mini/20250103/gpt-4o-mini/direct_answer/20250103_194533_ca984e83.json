  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Levamisole is primarily used as an anthelmintic for treating ascariasis and as an immunostimulant. It works by causing paralysis of worms through depolarization. However, it is not used as an immunodepressant; in fact, high doses can have immunomodulatory effects rather than immunosuppression. Therefore, the correct answer is that it is not used as an immunodepressant in high doses.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opd\",\n    \"confidence\": 90\n}",
