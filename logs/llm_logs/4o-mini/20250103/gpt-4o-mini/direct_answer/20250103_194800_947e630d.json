Pilocarpine is a miotic agent that helps to open the drainage angle and is commonly used in this condition. Clozapine, fluphenazine, and paroxetine are antipsychotic and antidepressant medications that do not have a role in treating acute angle closure glaucoma and may even exacerbate the condition.
