  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"The respiratory neurons in the medulla are primarily stimulated by increases in PCO2 and H+ concentration, as well as decreases in PO2. A rise in PO2 does not stimulate respiratory neuron activity; instead, it can lead to decreased activity. Therefore, the correct answer is the factor that does not increase respiratory neuron activity.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opc\",\n    \"confidence\": 90\n}",
