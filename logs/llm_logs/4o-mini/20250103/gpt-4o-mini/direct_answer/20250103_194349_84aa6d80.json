  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Pilocarpine is a muscarinic agonist that primarily works by contracting the iris sphincter muscle, which leads to miosis (pupil constriction). This action helps to open the angle between the iris and cornea, facilitating increased aqueous humor outflow and thereby reducing intraocular pressure in closed angle glaucoma. While it does increase aqueous humor outflow, the most direct mechanism by which it reduces intraocular pressure in this context is through the contraction of the iris sphincter muscle.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opb\",\n    \"confidence\": 85\n}",
