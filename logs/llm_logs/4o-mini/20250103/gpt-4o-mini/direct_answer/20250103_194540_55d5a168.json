  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"The plasma membrane of a cell is connected to the cytoskeleton primarily through proteins that link membrane proteins to the cytoskeletal components. Spectrin is a cytoskeletal protein that forms a meshwork beneath the plasma membrane, and it is anchored to the membrane by ankyrin. Therefore, while both spectrin and ankyrin are involved, ankyrin serves as the direct link between the plasma membrane and spectrin, which connects to the cytoskeleton. Thus, the best answer is ankyrin.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opb\",\n    \"confidence\": 90\n}",
