  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Iron absorption primarily occurs in the duodenum, which is the first part of the small intestine. While some iron can be absorbed in the jejunum, the duodenum is the main site for iron uptake due to the presence of specific transporters and the acidic environment that enhances iron solubility. Therefore, the most accurate option is 'Duodenum'.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opb\",\n    \"confidence\": 90\n}",
