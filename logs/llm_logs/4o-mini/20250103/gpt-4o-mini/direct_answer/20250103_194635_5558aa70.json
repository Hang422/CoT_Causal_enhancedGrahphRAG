  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Propranolol (opa) is a beta-blocker primarily used for hypertension and anxiety, and while it can have some mood-related side effects, depression is not commonly associated with it. Oral contraceptives (opb) can have mood changes, including depression, in some users. Reserpine (opc) is known to cause depression as a side effect due to its action on monoamine neurotransmitters. Flupenthixol (opd) is an antipsychotic that can also lead to depressive symptoms. Therefore, the least likely to cause depression is Propranolol.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opa\",\n    \"confidence\": 85\n}",
