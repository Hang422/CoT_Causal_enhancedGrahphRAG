  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Enalapril is an ACE inhibitor that is often used as a first-line treatment for hypertension, particularly in patients with diabetes due to its renal protective effects. In this case, the 56-year-old diabetic woman would benefit the most from enalapril. The other options present contraindications or are not ideal scenarios for the use of enalapril: renal artery stenosis can worsen renal function with ACE inhibitors, pregnancy is a contraindication for ACE inhibitors, and hyperkalemia is a risk factor for further increases in potassium levels with ACE inhibitors.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opd\",\n    \"confidence\": 90\n}",
