  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"The question suggests a deficiency in a specific enzyme related to a child's condition. HGPRTase deficiency is associated with Lesch-Nyhan syndrome, while adenosine deaminase deficiency is linked to severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID). APRTase deficiency leads to 2,8-dihydroxyadenine urolithiasis, and acid maltase deficiency is related to Pompe disease. Without specific symptoms or context, it's challenging to determine the exact deficiency. However, if the child presents with symptoms of SCID, adenosine deaminase would be the likely deficiency.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opb\",\n    \"confidence\": 75\n}",
