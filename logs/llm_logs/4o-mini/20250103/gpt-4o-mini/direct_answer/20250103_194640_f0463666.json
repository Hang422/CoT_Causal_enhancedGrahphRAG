Increase in glucagon/insulin ratio, increased CAMP and increased blood glucose\nopb. Decreased insulin, increased free fatty acid which is equivalent to blood glucose\nopc. Decreased insulin, increased free fatty acid which is not equivalent to blood glucose\nopd.

  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"In diabetic ketoacidosis, there is a significant decrease in insulin levels, which leads to increased lipolysis and subsequently elevated free fatty acids. This process results in the production of ketone bodies. The glucagon/insulin ratio is increased due to low insulin levels, contributing to hyperglycemia. Therefore, the correct option should reflect decreased insulin and increased free fatty acids, with the understanding that free fatty acids are not equivalent to blood glucose in terms of metabolic effects.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opc\",\n    \"confidence\": 90\n}",
