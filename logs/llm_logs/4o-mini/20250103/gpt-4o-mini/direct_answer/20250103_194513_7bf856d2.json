  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Loxatidine is a drug that acts as a selective antagonist of the gastric acid secretion pathway, blocking both basal and stimulated gastric acid secretion without directly affecting cholinergic, histaminergic, or gastrin receptors. Omeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor that also reduces gastric acid secretion but does not fit the criteria of not affecting the mentioned receptors. Pirenzepine is a muscarinic antagonist, and Famotidine is an H2 receptor antagonist, both of which do not meet the criteria. Therefore, Loxatidine is the correct choice.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opa\",\n    \"confidence\": 85\n}",
