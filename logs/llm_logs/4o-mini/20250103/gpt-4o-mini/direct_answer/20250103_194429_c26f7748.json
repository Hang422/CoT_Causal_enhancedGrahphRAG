  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Myoclonus in children can be effectively treated with Clonazepam, which is a benzodiazepine known for its muscle relaxant properties and effectiveness in managing myoclonic seizures. Sodium Valproate is also used for seizure disorders but is not the first-line treatment specifically for myoclonus. Phenobarbitone is less commonly used due to its side effects and potential for sedation. Ethosuximide is primarily used for absence seizures and is not indicated for myoclonus. Therefore, Clonazepam is the best choice among the options provided.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opa\",\n    \"confidence\": 85\n}",
