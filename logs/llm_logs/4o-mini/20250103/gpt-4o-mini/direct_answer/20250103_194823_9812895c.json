  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Amyloidosis associated with multiple myeloma does have a poor prognosis, making option 'opa' true. Fine-needle biopsy of subcutaneous abdominal fat is indeed a reliable method for diagnosing secondary systemic amyloidosis, so option 'opb' is also true. Hepatic amyloid disease can lead to hepatomegaly and may cause jaundice, contradicting option 'opc', which states it rarely causes jaundice. Lastly, amyloidosis of the spleen is not typically associated with severe anemia, making option 'opd' misleading. Therefore, the statement that is not true is 'opc'.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opc\",\n    \"confidence\": 85\n}",
