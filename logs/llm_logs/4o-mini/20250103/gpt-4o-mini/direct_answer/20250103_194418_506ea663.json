  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"In this scenario, the 3-year-old sibling of the boy diagnosed with pulmonary tuberculosis should receive isoniazid (INH) prophylaxis to prevent the development of active tuberculosis, as children under 5 years old are at higher risk of progression from latent to active TB. A baseline auditory function test is not routinely required before starting treatment with isoniazid, rifampin, and ethambutol. Polyarthralgia is not a common adverse effect of these drugs, although ethambutol can cause ocular toxicity. The mother, if not infected with TB, does not require INH prophylaxis. Therefore, the most accurate statement is that the sibling should receive INH prophylaxis.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opa\",\n    \"confidence\": 90\n}",
