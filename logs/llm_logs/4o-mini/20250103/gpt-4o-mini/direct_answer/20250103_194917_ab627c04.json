  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Uricosuric drugs are medications that increase the excretion of uric acid in the urine. Among the options provided, Probenecid is the only drug that is classified as a uricosuric agent, as it inhibits the reabsorption of uric acid in the renal tubules, leading to increased uric acid excretion. Allopurinol is a xanthine oxidase inhibitor used to lower uric acid levels, Indomethacin is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), and Aspirin can have variable effects on uric acid levels depending on the dose. Therefore, the correct answer is Probenecid.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opb\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}",
