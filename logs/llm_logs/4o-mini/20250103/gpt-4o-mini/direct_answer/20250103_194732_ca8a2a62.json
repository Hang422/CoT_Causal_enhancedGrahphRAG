  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"High Density Lipoprotein (HDL) is known for its role in reverse cholesterol transport, helping to clear lipids from atheromas and reducing foam cell production by LDL. It is also considered a good predictor of coronary artery disease (CAD), although recent studies suggest that its predictive value may not be as strong as once thought. However, HDL does not increase the oxidation of LDL; rather, it helps to protect LDL from oxidation. Therefore, the statement that HDL increases oxidation of LDL is false.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opa\",\n    \"confidence\": 90\n}",
