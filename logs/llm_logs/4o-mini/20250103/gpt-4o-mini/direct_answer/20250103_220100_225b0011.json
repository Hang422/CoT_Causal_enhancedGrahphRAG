  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Triamterene is a potassium-sparing diuretic that primarily works by inhibiting sodium reabsorption in the distal nephron, which leads to potassium retention. Therefore, it does not cause hypokalemia; rather, it can lead to hyperkalemia. Muscle cramps can occur as a side effect of electrolyte imbalances, but they are not a direct effect of triamterene. It does not improve glucose tolerance or decrease urea levels significantly. Thus, the most relevant option is that it does not cause hypokalemia.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opd\",\n    \"confidence\": 90\n}",
