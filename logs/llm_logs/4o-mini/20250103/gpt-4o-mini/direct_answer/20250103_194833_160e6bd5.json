  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"ADH (antidiuretic hormone) secretion is primarily stimulated by increased plasma osmolarity and hypovolemia. Hypovolemia, which refers to a decrease in blood volume, triggers the release of ADH to promote water reabsorption in the kidneys, thereby helping to restore blood volume. Therefore, hypovolemia is the correct answer.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opc\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}",
