  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Insulin promotes lipogenesis primarily by increasing the activity of acetyl-CoA carboxylase, facilitating glucose transport into cells, and decreasing intracellular cAMP levels, which reduces lipolysis. However, inhibiting pyruvate dehydrogenase is not a mechanism by which insulin promotes lipogenesis; rather, insulin typically activates this enzyme to promote the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA, which is a precursor for lipogenesis.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opc\",\n    \"confidence\": 90\n}",
