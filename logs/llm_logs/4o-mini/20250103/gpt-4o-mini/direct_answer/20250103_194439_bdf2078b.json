  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Warfarin induces skin necrosis primarily due to a rapid decrease in vitamin K-dependent clotting factors, particularly when there is a deficiency of Protein C. Protein C is an anticoagulant that helps to regulate clotting; its deficiency can lead to an increased risk of thrombosis and skin necrosis when anticoagulation is initiated with warfarin. Therefore, the correct answer is related to Protein C deficiency.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opa\",\n    \"confidence\": 90\n}",
