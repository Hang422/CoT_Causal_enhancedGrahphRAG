  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"The lungs play a crucial role in the conversion of angiotensin-I to angiotensin-II through the action of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) located in the pulmonary endothelium. This function is significant in the regulation of blood pressure and fluid balance. While the lungs also inactivate serotonin and bradykinin, the conversion of angiotensin-I to angiotensin-II is the most well-known metabolic function associated with the lungs.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opb\",\n    \"confidence\": 90\n}",
