  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Epinephrine, when administered intravenously in high doses, typically increases liver glycogenolysis (option opa), evokes extrasystoles in the heart (option opc), and produces restlessness and anxiety (option opd). However, it causes bronchiolar dilation rather than constriction. Therefore, option opb, which states that it causes bronchiolar constriction, is not an action of epinephrine.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opb\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}",
