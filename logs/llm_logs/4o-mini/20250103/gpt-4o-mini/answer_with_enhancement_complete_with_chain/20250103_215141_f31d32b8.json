Hyperparathyroidism\nopb. Diabetes mellitus\nopc. Kwashiorkor\nopd. Primary aldosteronism\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nHypermagnesemia is characterized by elevated serum magnesium levels. The reasoning for each option is as follows: \n\n1. **Hyperparathyroidism**: This condition leads to increased bone resorption, which can release magnesium from bones, potentially resulting in elevated serum magnesium levels. This aligns with consensus, thus supporting the possibility of hypermagnesemia in this condition. \n\n2. **Diabetes mellitus**: While diabetes can lead to renal impairment, which may decrease magnesium excretion, the direct link to hypermagnesemia is less clear. The retrieved evidence path indicates that renal insufficiency can occur, but it does not definitively support hypermagnesemia as a common outcome. Therefore, this option is less certain. \n\n3. **Kwashiorkor**: This condition is associated with malnutrition and electrolyte imbalances, but the relationship with magnesium levels is unclear. There is no strong consensus supporting hypermagnesemia in this context, so this option is not supported. \n\n4. **Primary aldosteronism**: This condition is characterized by increased aldosterone secretion, which typically leads to increased renal excretion of magnesium, resulting in decreased serum magnesium levels. This contradicts the possibility of hypermagnesemia and is thus not supported. \n\nIn summary, hyperparathyroidism is the most likely condition associated with hypermagnesemia, while diabetes mellitus, kwashiorkor, and primary aldosteronism do not support this condition based on current consensus.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Hypermagnesemia is primarily associated with conditions that lead to increased serum magnesium levels. Among the options provided, hyperparathyroidism is the most likely condition to cause hypermagnesemia due to increased bone resorption, which can release magnesium into the bloodstream. Diabetes mellitus does not have a strong direct link to hypermagnesemia, as it is more associated with renal impairment that can lead to magnesium loss rather than retention. Kwashiorkor is related to malnutrition and does not typically result in hypermagnesemia. Primary aldosteronism leads to increased magnesium excretion, making hypermagnesemia unlikely. Therefore, hyperparathyroidism is the best-supported option based on current medical consensus.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
