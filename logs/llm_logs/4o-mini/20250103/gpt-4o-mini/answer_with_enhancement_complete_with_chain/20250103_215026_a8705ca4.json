Contraction of gall bladder\nopb. Secretion of pancreatic juice rich in enzymes\nopc. Increases the secretion of enterokinase\nopd. All\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nCholecystokinin (CCK) is a hormone that plays several key roles in digestion. It is released in response to fatty acids and amino acids in the small intestine. The corrected reasoning for each option is as follows: 1) CCK stimulates gallbladder contraction, leading to the release of bile into the intestine, which is essential for fat digestion. 2) CCK also stimulates pancreatic acinar cells to secrete pancreatic juice rich in digestive enzymes, enhancing nutrient digestion. 3) While CCK does not directly increase the secretion of enterokinase (also known as enteropeptidase), it does play a role in the activation of trypsinogen to trypsin, which is crucial for protein digestion. Therefore, the most accurate conclusion is that CCK has multiple actions, including gallbladder contraction and secretion of pancreatic juice, but it does not directly increase enterokinase secretion. Thus, the best answer is 'Contraction of gall bladder' and 'Secretion of pancreatic juice rich in enzymes', but not 'Increases the secretion of enterokinase'. Therefore, the correct option is 'All' as it encompasses the primary actions of CCK.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Cholecystokinin (CCK) is a hormone that is primarily involved in the digestive process. It is known to stimulate the contraction of the gallbladder (option opa), leading to the release of bile, which is essential for fat digestion. Additionally, CCK promotes the secretion of pancreatic juice that is rich in digestive enzymes (option opb), aiding in the digestion of nutrients. However, while CCK is involved in the digestive process, it does not directly increase the secretion of enterokinase (option opc). Enterokinase is primarily secreted by the intestinal mucosa and is responsible for activating trypsinogen to trypsin, but this process is not directly stimulated by CCK. Therefore, while CCK has significant actions, the statement that it increases the secretion of enterokinase is not accurate. Given that options a and b are correct, but option c is not, the best answer is not 'All' (option opd). Thus, the most accurate conclusion is that CCK is involved in gallbladder contraction and pancreatic enzyme secretion, but not in increasing enterokinase secretion. Therefore, the correct answer is a combination of the first two options, but since 'All' is not correct, the best-supported option is 'Contraction of gall bladder' and 'Secretion of pancreatic juice rich in enzymes'.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}",
