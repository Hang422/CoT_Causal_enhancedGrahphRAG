Proximal tubule\nopb. Distal tubules\nopc. Loop of Henle\nopd. Collecting duct\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nAldosterone primarily acts on the distal tubules and collecting duct of the nephron. It increases sodium reabsorption and potassium excretion through the stimulation of sodium-potassium ATPase, which is most significant in these segments. This action is crucial for regulating electrolyte balance and influencing water retention. The retrieved evidence paths confirm that aldosterone's role is associated with renal tubule function and electrolyte management, supporting the consensus that its primary action occurs in the distal tubules and collecting duct.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Aldosterone is a steroid hormone produced by the adrenal cortex that plays a critical role in regulating sodium and potassium levels in the body. Its primary action occurs in the distal tubules and collecting duct of the nephron. Aldosterone promotes sodium reabsorption and potassium excretion by stimulating the sodium-potassium ATPase pump in these segments. While the proximal tubule and Loop of Henle are involved in electrolyte and water reabsorption, they are not the primary sites of aldosterone action. Therefore, the most accurate answer, based on established medical knowledge and the enhanced information provided, is that aldosterone acts primarily on the distal tubules and collecting duct. Given this consensus, the best-supported option is 'opb' for distal tubules and 'opd' for collecting duct, but since the question asks for a single option, I will select 'opd' as it encompasses the final segment where aldosterone exerts significant effects.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}",
