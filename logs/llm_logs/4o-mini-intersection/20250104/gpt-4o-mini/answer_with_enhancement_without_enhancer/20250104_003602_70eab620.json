Acute renal failure\nopb. Development of antiplatelet antibodies\nopc. Encephalitis secondary to liver dysfunction\nopd. Hemorrhagic stroke\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nFibrinolytic drugs, used in the treatment of acute myocardial infarction, primarily work by dissolving thrombi, which restores blood flow. However, this mechanism significantly increases the risk of bleeding complications, particularly hemorrhagic stroke. The reasoning chains consistently highlight the relationship between fibrinolytic therapy and increased bleeding risk, with estimates of hemorrhagic stroke risk ranging from 75% to 90%. Evidence paths confirm that hemorrhage, particularly intracranial hemorrhage, is a known complication of thrombolytic therapy, leading to hemorrhagic stroke. Other options, such as acute renal failure, development of antiplatelet antibodies, and encephalitis secondary to liver dysfunction, are not commonly associated with fibrinolytic therapy and lack supporting evidence. Therefore, the most likely adverse effect of fibrinolytic drug use in this context is hemorrhagic stroke.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

However, one of the most significant risks associated with their use is bleeding, particularly intracranial hemorrhage, which can lead to a hemorrhagic stroke. The enhanced information supports this by indicating that the risk of hemorrhagic stroke is notably high, with estimates suggesting a substantial likelihood of this adverse effect occurring. In contrast, the other options—acute renal failure, development of antiplatelet antibodies, and encephalitis secondary to liver dysfunction—are not commonly associated with fibrinolytic therapy and lack substantial evidence linking them to this treatment. Therefore, based on the consensus in medical literature and the enhanced information provided, the most likely adverse effect of fibrinolytic drug use in the context of acute myocardial infarction is indeed hemorrhagic stroke.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
