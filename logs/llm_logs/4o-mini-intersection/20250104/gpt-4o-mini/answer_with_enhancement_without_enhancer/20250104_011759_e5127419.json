Hypoglycemia\nopb. Cinchonism\nopc. Arrhythmias\nopd. Sweating\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nThe administration of i.v. quinine can lead to side effects known as Cinchonism, which includes symptoms such as restlessness and sweating. This aligns with the consensus that Cinchonism is a common adverse reaction to quinine due to its central nervous system stimulation. While hypoglycemia and arrhythmias are potential concerns, they are less directly linked to the specific symptoms of restlessness and sweating observed in this case. Therefore, the most likely cause of the patient's symptoms is Cinchonism, supported by the reasoning that quinine's pharmacological effects can lead to agitation and other CNS-related symptoms.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The symptoms of restlessness and sweating following the administration of i.v. quinine are most consistent with Cinchonism, which is a well-documented adverse effect of quinine. Cinchonism can manifest as a range of symptoms including tinnitus, headache, nausea, and central nervous system effects such as restlessness and sweating. While hypoglycemia and arrhythmias are potential complications associated with quinine, they do not directly correlate with the specific symptoms presented in this case. Therefore, based on the consensus in pharmacology regarding the side effects of quinine, the most likely cause of the patient's symptoms is Cinchonism.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}",
