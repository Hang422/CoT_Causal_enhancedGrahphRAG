Abciximab\nopb. Eptifibatide\nopc. Tirofiban\nopd. Prasugrel\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nGp2b3A inhibitors are a class of drugs that prevent platelet aggregation, specifically including abciximab, eptifibatide, and tirofiban. Prasugrel, however, is classified as a thienopyridine antiplatelet agent that works through a different mechanism, primarily by inhibiting the P2Y12 receptor on platelets, rather than directly inhibiting the Gp2b3A receptor. Therefore, prasugrel is not a Gp2b3A inhibitor. The reasoning chains correctly identify that abciximab, eptifibatide, and tirofiban are Gp2b3A inhibitors, while prasugrel is not, aligning with pharmacological consensus.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Gp2b3A inhibitors are a specific class of antiplatelet agents that work by blocking the glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor on platelets, thereby preventing platelet aggregation. The drugs listed in the options include abciximab, eptifibatide, and tirofiban, all of which are well-established Gp2b3A inhibitors. In contrast, prasugrel is a thienopyridine that functions by inhibiting the P2Y12 receptor, which is a different mechanism of action. Therefore, based on pharmacological classification and consensus, prasugrel does not belong to the category of Gp2b3A inhibitors. This reasoning is supported by established medical knowledge and guidelines.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
