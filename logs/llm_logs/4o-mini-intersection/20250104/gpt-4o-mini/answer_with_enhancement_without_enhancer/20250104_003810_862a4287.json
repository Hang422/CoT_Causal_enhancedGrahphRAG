Anti depressants\nopb. Anti psychotics\nopc. Anti epileptics\nopd. Mood stabilizers\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nSchizophrenia is primarily treated with antipsychotics, which are effective in managing psychotic symptoms. While mood stabilizers and antidepressants may be used in certain cases, they are not considered first-line treatments for schizophrenia. Antiepileptics are also not standard treatments, although they may be considered in specific cases of comorbidity. The consensus supports that antipsychotics are the mainstay of treatment, with other medications being adjunctive rather than primary therapies.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

While antidepressants, mood stabilizers, and antiepileptics may have roles in managing certain symptoms or comorbid conditions, they are not considered first-line treatments for schizophrenia. The consensus in the medical community strongly supports the use of antipsychotics as the mainstay of treatment. Therefore, the most appropriate and supported option is 'opb.
