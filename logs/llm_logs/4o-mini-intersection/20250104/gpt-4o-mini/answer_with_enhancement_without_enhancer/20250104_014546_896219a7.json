Strongyloidiasis\nopb. Trichomoniasis\nopc. Schistosomiasis\nopd. Rhinosporidiosis\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nPraziquantel is an antiparasitic medication primarily effective against trematodes, particularly used for the treatment of schistosomiasis. It is not effective against nematodes, which are responsible for strongyloidiasis, nor is it indicated for trichomoniasis, a protozoan infection, or rhinosporidiosis, which is caused by a fungus. Therefore, the correct use of praziquantel is for schistosomiasis.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

The other options listed (strongyloidiasis, trichomoniasis, and rhinosporidiosis) are caused by different types of pathogens: strongyloidiasis is caused by a nematode, trichomoniasis is a protozoan infection, and rhinosporidiosis is caused by a fungus. Therefore, based on established medical knowledge and the enhanced information provided, praziquantel is specifically indicated for schistosomiasis.
