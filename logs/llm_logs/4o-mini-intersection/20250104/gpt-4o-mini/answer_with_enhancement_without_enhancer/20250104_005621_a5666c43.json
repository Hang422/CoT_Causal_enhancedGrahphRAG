Proximal tubule\nopb. Distal tubules\nopc. Loop of Henle\nopd. Collecting duct\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nAldosterone primarily acts on the distal tubules and collecting duct of the nephron. It increases sodium reabsorption and potassium excretion through the stimulation of sodium-potassium ATPase, which is most significant in these segments. The reasoning chains correctly highlight that aldosterone's actions are focused on the distal tubules and collecting duct, aligning with the consensus that these are the main sites of its action. Evidence paths related to aldosterone's role in regulating electrolyte balance and influencing water retention further support this understanding, confirming its critical role in renal function and fluid homeostasis.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Aldosterone is a steroid hormone produced by the adrenal cortex that plays a crucial role in regulating sodium and potassium levels in the body. Its primary action occurs in the distal tubules and collecting duct of the nephron, where it promotes sodium reabsorption and potassium excretion. This mechanism is facilitated by the stimulation of sodium-potassium ATPase pumps, which are predominantly located in these segments of the nephron. While the proximal tubule and Loop of Henle are involved in other aspects of renal function, they are not the primary sites of aldosterone action. Therefore, the most accurate answer, based on established pharmacological principles and consensus, is that aldosterone acts on the distal tubules and collecting duct. Given this understanding, the best-supported option is 'opb' for distal tubules, but it is important to note that the collecting duct is also a significant site of action. Thus, the final answer reflects the primary site of action as per the options provided.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}",
