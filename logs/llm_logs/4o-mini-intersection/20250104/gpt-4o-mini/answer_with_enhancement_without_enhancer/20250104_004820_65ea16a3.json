Vitamin A\nopb. Vitamin B\nopc. Vitamin C\nopd. Vitamin E\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nNyctalopia, or night blindness, is primarily caused by a deficiency of Vitamin A. This vitamin is essential for the production of rhodopsin, a visual pigment in the retina that is crucial for low-light vision. The reasoning chains consistently highlight the link between Vitamin A deficiency and impaired vision in dim light, confirming that Vitamin A is necessary for retinal function and the regeneration of visual pigments. Evidence paths further support this by establishing the relationship between Vitamin A deficiency and visual impairment, reinforcing the consensus that Vitamin A is the key nutrient associated with nyctalopia.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

This vitamin is crucial for the synthesis of rhodopsin, a pigment found in the retina that is essential for vision in low-light conditions. The enhanced information confirms that Vitamin A deficiency leads to impaired night vision due to its role in retinal function.
