Protein linked with glycosidic bond\nopb. Core protein\nopc. Sugar residues are long in carbohydrate poion of glycoprotein\nopd. None\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nGlycoproteins are biomolecules that consist of a protein core linked to carbohydrate moieties via glycosidic bonds. The first option is correct as it states that glycoproteins have proteins linked with glycosidic bonds, which is a defining characteristic. The second option is also accurate, as glycoproteins indeed have a core protein to which sugar residues are attached. The third option, while partially true, is misleading; while glycoproteins can have varying lengths of carbohydrate chains, it is not universally applicable that sugar residues are long. Therefore, the consensus supports the first two options as correct characteristics of glycoproteins, while the third option is too vague. The evidence paths confirm that glycoproteins are integral to cellular functions, but they do not directly clarify the specific characteristics of glycoproteins themselves.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Glycoproteins are defined by their structure, which includes a core protein linked to carbohydrate moieties through glycosidic bonds. The first option (opa) correctly states that glycoproteins are proteins linked with glycosidic bonds, which is a fundamental characteristic. The second option (opb) is also accurate, as glycoproteins indeed have a core protein. The third option (opc) is somewhat misleading; while glycoproteins can have varying lengths of carbohydrate chains, it is not universally true that the sugar residues are long. Therefore, the first two options are correct characteristics of glycoproteins, while the third is too vague and not universally applicable. Given this analysis, the best-supported options are the first two, but since the question asks for characteristics, I will select the most definitive one, which is option (opa).\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
