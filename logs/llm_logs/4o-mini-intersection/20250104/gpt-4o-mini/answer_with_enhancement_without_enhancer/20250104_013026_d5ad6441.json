Haloperidol\nopb. Imipramine\nopc. Alprazolam\nopd. Methylphenidate\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nMethylphenidate is the drug of choice for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), as it is a central nervous system stimulant that effectively increases attention span and reduces impulsivity, aligning with clinical guidelines that recommend stimulant medications as first-line treatments. Haloperidol, an antipsychotic, is not typically used for ADHD and may complicate its management. Imipramine, a tricyclic antidepressant, is not considered a first-line treatment for ADHD. Alprazolam, a benzodiazepine, is also not indicated for ADHD and may complicate its symptoms. Therefore, the consensus supports methylphenidate as the preferred choice for ADHD management.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The core medical principle for treating attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is the use of stimulant medications, which are well-supported by clinical guidelines. Methylphenidate is a central nervous system stimulant that has been shown to effectively increase attention span and reduce impulsivity in individuals with ADHD. The other options provided—Haloperidol, Imipramine, and Alprazolam—are not first-line treatments for ADHD. Haloperidol is an antipsychotic, Imipramine is a tricyclic antidepressant, and Alprazolam is a benzodiazepine, none of which are indicated for ADHD management. Therefore, based on the consensus in pharmacological treatment for ADHD, methylphenidate is the drug of choice.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
