Succinylcholine\nopb. Tubocurare\nopc. Pyridostigmine\nopd. Halothane\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nIn myasthenia gravis, an autoimmune neuromuscular disorder characterized by muscle weakness, certain drugs can exacerbate symptoms and increase the risk of respiratory failure. Succinylcholine, a neuromuscular blocker, can lead to significant muscle paralysis and is contraindicated due to its potential to worsen weakness in these patients. Tubocurare, another neuromuscular blocker, is also not ideal as it can induce respiratory muscle weakness, making it unsuitable for myasthenia gravis patients. Pyridostigmine, a cholinesterase inhibitor, is commonly used to improve neuromuscular transmission and is generally safe for these patients. Halothane, while a volatile anesthetic that may cause muscle relaxation, is not specifically contraindicated but requires caution due to its potential effects on neuromuscular function. Therefore, the drugs contraindicated in myasthenia gravis are Succinylcholine and Tubocurare.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"In patients with myasthenia gravis, the use of certain neuromuscular blockers can exacerbate muscle weakness and lead to respiratory failure. Succinylcholine is particularly contraindicated because it can cause profound muscle paralysis, which is dangerous in these patients. Tubocurare, another neuromuscular blocker, also poses a risk as it can induce respiratory muscle weakness. Pyridostigmine is a cholinesterase inhibitor that is actually used to treat myasthenia gravis and is safe for these patients. Halothane, while it can affect neuromuscular function, is not specifically contraindicated but should be used with caution. Given this information, the most clearly contraindicated drug in myasthenia gravis is Succinylcholine. Therefore, the best-supported option is 'opa. Succinylcholine.'\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}",
