Loxatidine\nopb. Pirenzepine\nopc. Omeprazole\nopd. Famotidine\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nLoxatidine is an H2 receptor antagonist that reduces gastric acid secretion but does not block cholinergic, histaminergic, or gastrin receptors, making it a potential candidate. However, it primarily blocks H2 receptors, which does not fully align with the requirement to block both basal and stimulated gastric acid secretion without affecting these receptors. Pirenzepine selectively blocks M1 muscarinic receptors and does not meet the criteria as it does not block H2 receptors. Omeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor that effectively blocks stimulated gastric acid secretion and does not affect cholinergic, histaminergic, or gastrin receptors, making it a strong candidate. Famotidine, like Loxatidine, is an H2 receptor antagonist and reduces gastric acid secretion but does not meet the requirement of blocking both basal and stimulated secretion without affecting the specified receptors. Therefore, the best option is Omeprazole, as it aligns with the criteria of blocking gastric acid secretion without affecting the specified receptors.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"To determine the drug that blocks both basal and stimulated gastric acid secretion without affecting cholinergic, histaminergic, or gastrin receptors, we need to analyze the options provided. Loxatidine and Famotidine are both H2 receptor antagonists, which primarily block H2 receptors and do not fully meet the requirement of blocking both types of secretion without affecting the specified receptors. Pirenzepine selectively blocks M1 muscarinic receptors and does not block H2 receptors, thus it does not meet the criteria. Omeprazole, a proton pump inhibitor, effectively inhibits the final step of gastric acid secretion and does not interact with the cholinergic, histaminergic, or gastrin receptors, making it the most suitable option. Therefore, Omeprazole is the best-supported choice based on the criteria given.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opc\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}",
