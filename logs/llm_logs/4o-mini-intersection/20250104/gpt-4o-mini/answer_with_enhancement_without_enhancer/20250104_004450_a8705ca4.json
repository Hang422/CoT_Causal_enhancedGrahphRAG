Contraction of gall bladder\nopb. Secretion of pancreatic juice rich in enzymes\nopc. Increases the secretion of enterokinase\nopd. All\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nCholecystokinin (CCK) is a hormone that plays a crucial role in digestion. It is released in response to the presence of fats and proteins in the small intestine. The actions of CCK include: 1) stimulating gallbladder contraction, leading to the release of bile into the intestine, which aids in fat digestion; 2) stimulating pancreatic acinar cells to secrete pancreatic juice rich in digestive enzymes, enhancing nutrient digestion; and 3) increasing the secretion of enterokinase, which activates trypsinogen to trypsin, further facilitating protein digestion. Therefore, all the actions listed in the options are correct, making 'All' the best answer. The evidence paths confirm the interaction of CCK with pancreatic acinar cells and its role in enzyme secretion, supporting the consensus that CCK has multiple digestive functions.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

It is released in response to the presence of fats and proteins in the small intestine. The core actions of CCK include stimulating the contraction of the gallbladder, which releases bile into the intestine, and promoting the secretion of pancreatic juice that is rich in digestive enzymes. Additionally, CCK also increases the secretion of enterokinase, which is important for activating trypsinogen to trypsin, further aiding in protein digestion. Given that all the options presented (gallbladder contraction, pancreatic enzyme secretion, and increased enterokinase secretion) are actions attributed to CCK, the most comprehensive and correct answer is 'All'.
