Mannitol\nopb. Spironolactone\nopc. Furosemide\nopd. Hydrochlorothiazide\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nMannitol is an osmotic diuretic that increases intravascular volume, which can worsen cardiac failure, making it contraindicated in this condition. Spironolactone is a potassium-sparing diuretic that is beneficial in heart failure, as it reduces mortality and is commonly used. Furosemide, a loop diuretic, is also a first-line treatment for heart failure, effectively reducing fluid overload. Hydrochlorothiazide is a thiazide diuretic that is not first-line for heart failure and should be used cautiously. Therefore, the diuretic contraindicated in the presence of cardiac failure is Mannitol.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"In the context of cardiac failure, the choice of diuretics is critical. Mannitol, an osmotic diuretic, increases intravascular volume, which can exacerbate heart failure symptoms by increasing preload. Therefore, it is contraindicated in patients with cardiac failure. On the other hand, spironolactone is beneficial in heart failure management due to its ability to block aldosterone, reducing mortality. Furosemide is a loop diuretic that is commonly used to manage fluid overload in heart failure patients. Hydrochlorothiazide is less effective in this context but is not outright contraindicated. Given this information, the diuretic that is contraindicated in the presence of cardiac failure is Mannitol.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
