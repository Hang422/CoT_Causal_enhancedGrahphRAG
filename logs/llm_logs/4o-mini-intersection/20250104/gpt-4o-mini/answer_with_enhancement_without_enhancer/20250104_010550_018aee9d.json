Fibrinolysis\nopb. Activation of collagenase\nopc. Destruction of VWF\nopd. Stabilization of fibrin\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nPlasmin is primarily known for its role in fibrinolysis, where it breaks down fibrin, facilitating the dissolution of blood clots. It does not activate collagenase, which is involved in the breakdown of collagen, nor does it stabilize fibrin; rather, it promotes its degradation. The role of plasmin in the destruction of von Willebrand factor (VWF) is not well-defined and is less significant compared to its fibrinolytic function. Therefore, the correct answer to the question regarding the functions of plasmin that it does not perform is 'stabilization of fibrin.'\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Plasmin is primarily known for its role in fibrinolysis, where it breaks down fibrin and facilitates the dissolution of blood clots. The options provided include functions that plasmin is known to perform and one that it does not. Specifically, plasmin does not stabilize fibrin; instead, it promotes its degradation. The activation of collagenase is not a function of plasmin, and while plasmin may have some role in the degradation of von Willebrand factor (VWF), this is not its primary function. Therefore, the most accurate answer to the question regarding the functions of plasmin that it does not perform is 'stabilization of fibrin.' This aligns with established medical knowledge regarding the role of plasmin in the body.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}",
