Endometrial carcinoma\nopc. >Carcinoma in contralateral breast\nopd. >Cataract\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nTamoxifen is associated with several adverse effects. The use of tamoxifen increases the risk of thromboembolism, which is a well-documented adverse effect (95% consensus). It also raises the risk of endometrial carcinoma, another recognized adverse effect (90% consensus). The risk of carcinoma in the contralateral breast is considered a possible adverse effect, but it is less clearly established compared to the first two (80% consensus). Cataract development is noted as a less commonly associated adverse effect (70% consensus). Therefore, while thromboembolism, endometrial carcinoma, and contralateral breast carcinoma are recognized risks, cataracts are less definitively linked to tamoxifen use. Thus, the correct answer to the question regarding which adverse effect is least associated with tamoxifen is cataract.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

The risk of carcinoma in the contralateral breast is acknowledged but is less clearly established compared to the first two (80%). Cataracts, while noted as a potential adverse effect, are less definitively linked to tamoxifen use (70%).
