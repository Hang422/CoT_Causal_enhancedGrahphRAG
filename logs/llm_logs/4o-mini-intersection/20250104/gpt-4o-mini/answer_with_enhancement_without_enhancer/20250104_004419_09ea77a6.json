Family of three seven transmembrane protein\nopb. Activated by thrombin\nopc. Releases PGE2\nopd. Protects epithelial cells\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nProtease activated receptors (PARs) are indeed a family of G protein-coupled receptors, specifically consisting of three main types: PAR1, PAR2, and PAR3, each with seven transmembrane domains, confirming that the statement about being a family of three seven transmembrane proteins is TRUE. PARs are activated by proteolytic cleavage, with thrombin being a well-known activator of PAR1, thus the statement about being activated by thrombin is also TRUE. While PARs can influence the release of various mediators, they primarily activate pathways leading to thromboxane and other mediators rather than directly releasing PGE2, making the statement about releasing PGE2 likely FALSE. Lastly, while PARs can influence protective mechanisms in epithelial cells, their primary role is not solely protective, making the statement about protecting epithelial cells somewhat ambiguous and not entirely accurate. Therefore, the option that is NOT TRUE is the one regarding the release of PGE2.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Protease activated receptors (PARs) are indeed a family of G protein-coupled receptors characterized by their seven transmembrane domains. The statement regarding them being a family of three seven transmembrane proteins is true (option opa). PARs are activated by thrombin, particularly PAR1, which is a well-established fact (option opb). The statement about releasing PGE2 (option opc) is less clear; while PARs can influence various signaling pathways, they are not primarily known for directly releasing PGE2. Instead, they are more associated with the activation of pathways leading to thromboxane and other mediators. Lastly, while PARs can have protective roles in epithelial cells, their primary function is not solely protective, making the statement about protecting epithelial cells somewhat ambiguous (option opd). Given this analysis, the statement about releasing PGE2 is the most likely to be false, as it does not align with the primary known functions of PARs. Therefore, the best-supported option that is NOT TRUE is option opc.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opc\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
