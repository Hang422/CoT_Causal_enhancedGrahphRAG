You would be concerned about the use of this drug if the patient also had what comorbid condition\n\n                    ### Options\n                    opa. Glaucoma\nopb. Essential tremor\nopc. Diabetes\nopd. Supraventricular tachycardia\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nPropranolol is a non-selective beta-blocker that can have significant effects on various comorbid conditions. In patients with diabetes, propranolol can mask the symptoms of hypoglycemia, which poses a risk of unrecognized low blood sugar, making this a concerning comorbidity (80% confidence). In patients with supraventricular tachycardia, propranolol can lower heart rate, potentially worsening bradycardia, which is also a concern (75% confidence). However, propranolol is not contraindicated in glaucoma and can be used cautiously, indicating less concern compared to diabetes and supraventricular tachycardia (90% confidence). Essential tremor is generally treated with propranolol, and there are no significant concerns regarding its use in this condition. Therefore, the most concerning comorbidity when using propranolol prophylactically after a myocardial infarct is diabetes.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Propranolol is a non-selective beta-blocker that can have various effects on comorbid conditions. In patients with diabetes, it is particularly concerning because it can mask the symptoms of hypoglycemia, which can lead to unrecognized low blood sugar levels. This poses a significant risk for patients with diabetes who may experience hypoglycemic episodes. In contrast, while propranolol can affect heart rate in patients with supraventricular tachycardia, it is not contraindicated and can be used with caution. For glaucoma, propranolol is not contraindicated and can be used, although it is not the first-line treatment. Essential tremor is often treated with propranolol, and there are no significant concerns regarding its use in this condition. Therefore, the most concerning comorbidity when using propranolol prophylactically after a myocardial infarct is diabetes, due to the risk of masking hypoglycemia symptoms. This aligns with the consensus in pharmacology regarding the use of beta-blockers in patients with diabetes.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opc\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
