Streptomycin\nopb. Ethambutol\nopc. Capreomycin\nopd. Rifampicin\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nStreptomycin is primarily excreted by the kidneys, leading to potential accumulation and toxicity in patients with severe renal failure, making it unsafe for use. Ethambutol is partially renally excreted and requires dose adjustment in renal failure; it can be used with caution. Capreomycin is also excreted by the kidneys and poses a risk of nephrotoxicity, thus it is not recommended in severe renal failure. Rifampicin is primarily metabolized by the liver with minimal renal excretion, making it generally safe for use in patients with renal failure. Therefore, the safest option in severe renal failure is Rifampicin.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"In patients with severe renal failure, the choice of antitubercular drugs must consider their pharmacokinetics and potential for toxicity. Streptomycin and Capreomycin are both primarily excreted by the kidneys, which increases the risk of accumulation and toxicity in patients with renal impairment, making them unsafe options. Ethambutol is partially renally excreted and requires dose adjustments, so it can be used with caution but is not ideal for severe renal failure. Rifampicin, on the other hand, is primarily metabolized by the liver, with minimal renal excretion, making it generally safe for use in patients with renal failure. Therefore, the best-supported option for use in severe renal failure is Rifampicin.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
