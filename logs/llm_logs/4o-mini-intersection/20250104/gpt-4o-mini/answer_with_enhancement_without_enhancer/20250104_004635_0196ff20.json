Ototoxicity\nopb. Nephrotoxicity\nopc. Coasting effect\nopd. Pulmonary fibrosis\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nCisplatin is known to cause ototoxicity, which can lead to hearing loss, and nephrotoxicity, resulting in renal impairment. The coasting effect is not associated with Cisplatin but rather with other chemotherapeutic agents, confirming that this is not a side effect of Cisplatin. Additionally, while there is some evidence suggesting a potential link between Cisplatin and pulmonary fibrosis, it is not a typical or well-established side effect compared to other agents. Therefore, the correct answer is that Cisplatin does not produce the coasting effect.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Cisplatin is a well-known chemotherapeutic agent that is associated with several side effects. The most commonly recognized side effects include ototoxicity, which can lead to hearing loss, and nephrotoxicity, which can cause renal impairment. The 'coasting effect' is a phenomenon associated with certain other chemotherapeutic agents, such as doxorubicin, and is not a recognized side effect of Cisplatin. While there is some discussion in the literature regarding a potential link between Cisplatin and pulmonary fibrosis, this is not a well-established or common side effect compared to the others listed. Therefore, the most accurate answer to the question is that Cisplatin does not produce the coasting effect.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opc\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}",
