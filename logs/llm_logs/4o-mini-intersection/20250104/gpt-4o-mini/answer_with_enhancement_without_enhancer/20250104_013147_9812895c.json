Amyloidosis associated with multiple myeloma has the poorest prognosis\nopb. Fine - needle biopsy of subcutaneous abdominal fat is a simple & reliable method for diagnosing secondary systemic amyloidosis\nopc. Hepatic amyloid disease produces hepatomegaly but rarely jaundice\nopd. Amyloidosis of the spleen is associated with severe anemia\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\n1. Amyloidosis associated with multiple myeloma is known to have a poor prognosis, which is widely accepted in medical literature. 2. Fine-needle biopsy of subcutaneous abdominal fat is indeed a simple and reliable method for diagnosing secondary systemic amyloidosis, aligning with clinical consensus. 3. Hepatic amyloid disease can cause hepatomegaly, and while jaundice can occur, it is relatively uncommon, which is consistent with known facts. 4. Amyloidosis of the spleen can lead to splenomegaly, but it is not typically associated with severe anemia, which contradicts the known associations. Therefore, the statement regarding amyloidosis of the spleen being associated with severe anemia is the least accurate.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"To determine which statement is not true concerning amyloidosis, we analyze each option based on established medical knowledge. Option 'opa' states that amyloidosis associated with multiple myeloma has the poorest prognosis, which is true as this association is well-documented. Option 'opb' claims that fine-needle biopsy of subcutaneous abdominal fat is a reliable method for diagnosing secondary systemic amyloidosis, which is also true and widely accepted in clinical practice. Option 'opc' mentions that hepatic amyloid disease produces hepatomegaly but rarely jaundice; this is generally accurate as hepatomegaly is common in hepatic amyloidosis, while jaundice is less frequent. Finally, option 'opd' states that amyloidosis of the spleen is associated with severe anemia. This is misleading because while splenic involvement can occur, it is more commonly associated with splenomegaly rather than severe anemia. Therefore, option 'opd' is the least accurate statement regarding amyloidosis. Based on this analysis, the best-supported answer is option 'opd'.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}",
