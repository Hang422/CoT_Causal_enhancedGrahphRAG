Aldosterone\nopb. DOCA\nopc. Fludrocoeisone\nopd. Triamcinolone\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nAldosterone is recognized as the most potent mineralocorticoid, primarily regulating sodium and potassium balance in the body. The reasoning chain for aldosterone is correct, as it is indeed the primary and most potent mineralocorticoid. DOCA (Deoxycorticosterone Acetate) is a mineralocorticoid but is less potent than aldosterone, which aligns with the consensus. Fludrocortisone is a synthetic mineralocorticoid that is more potent than cortisol but not as potent as aldosterone, confirming the reasoning. Triamcinolone, classified as a glucocorticoid, does not possess mineralocorticoid activity, which is also consistent with established pharmacological knowledge. Therefore, the most potent mineralocorticoid is aldosterone.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "
