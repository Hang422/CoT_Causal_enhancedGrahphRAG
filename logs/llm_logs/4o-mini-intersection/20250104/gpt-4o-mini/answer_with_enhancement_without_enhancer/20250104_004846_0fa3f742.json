Thiamine\nopb. Pyridoxine\nopc. Niacin\nopd. Riboflavin\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nIsoniazid (INH) can induce peripheral neuropathy primarily due to its interference with vitamin B6 metabolism, leading to pyridoxine (vitamin B6) deficiency. Pyridoxine supplementation is recommended to prevent and treat INH-induced neuropathy, as it is crucial for nerve function and helps alleviate neuropathy symptoms. The consensus supports that pyridoxine is the effective treatment for this condition, aligning with the reasoning that INH causes vitamin B6 depletion, which is essential for maintaining nerve health.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Isoniazid (INH) is known to cause peripheral neuropathy primarily due to its interference with vitamin B6 metabolism, leading to a deficiency in pyridoxine. This deficiency is critical because vitamin B6 is essential for the synthesis of neurotransmitters and the maintenance of nerve function. The consensus in the medical community is that pyridoxine supplementation is the most effective treatment for INH-induced neuropathy. Other options such as thiamine, niacin, and riboflavin do not address the specific deficiency caused by INH. Therefore, the best-supported option for treating INH-induced neuropathy is pyridoxine (vitamin B6).\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
