Tyrosine transaminase\nopb. Tyrosine hydroxylase\nopc. Phenylalanine hydroxylase\nopd. Phenylketonuria hydroxylase\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nPhenylketonuria (PKU) is a genetic disorder caused by a deficiency in the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH), which is responsible for converting phenylalanine to tyrosine. This deficiency leads to the accumulation of phenylalanine in the body, resulting in various neurological and developmental issues. The reasoning chains consistently point to phenylalanine hydroxylase as the key enzyme affected in PKU, aligning with the consensus that PKU is primarily due to mutations in the PAH gene, leading to its dysfunction. Evidence paths confirm the relationship between phenylalanine metabolism and the role of phenylalanine hydroxylase, further supporting the conclusion that the correct answer is option (opc) Phenylalanine hydroxylase.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Phenylketonuria (PKU) is a well-established genetic disorder caused by a deficiency in the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH). This enzyme is crucial for the conversion of phenylalanine to tyrosine. When PAH is deficient, phenylalanine accumulates in the body, leading to various neurological and developmental issues. The other options listed (tyrosine transaminase, tyrosine hydroxylase, and phenylketonuria hydroxylase) do not directly relate to the cause of PKU. Therefore, based on the consensus in medical literature and the enhanced information provided, the most accurate answer is option (opc) Phenylalanine hydroxylase.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opc\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
