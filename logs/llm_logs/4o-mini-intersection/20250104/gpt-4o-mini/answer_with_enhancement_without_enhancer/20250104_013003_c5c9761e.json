Salbutamol\nopb. Ketotifen\nopc. Fluticasone\nopd. Monteleukast\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nSalbutamol is a beta adrenergic agonist that is commonly used as an aerosol for the treatment of bronchial asthma due to its bronchodilatory effects. The reasoning chain for Salbutamol is correct and aligns with consensus, confirming its effectiveness in asthma management. Ketotifen is an antihistamine and not a beta adrenergic agonist, thus it is not used for asthma treatment. Fluticasone is a corticosteroid with anti-inflammatory properties but is not a beta adrenergic agonist and is not used as an aerosol for asthma. Montelukast is a leukotriene receptor antagonist and also not a beta adrenergic agonist, making it unsuitable for aerosol use in asthma. Therefore, the only correct option for aerosol treatment of bronchial asthma is Salbutamol.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Salbutamol is a well-established beta adrenergic agonist that is specifically used as a bronchodilator in the management of bronchial asthma. It works by relaxing the muscles in the airways, leading to dilation and improved airflow. The other options provided do not fit the criteria of a beta adrenergic agonist: Ketotifen is an antihistamine, Fluticasone is a corticosteroid, and Montelukast is a leukotriene receptor antagonist. Therefore, based on the consensus in pharmacology and asthma treatment guidelines, Salbutamol is the only correct answer for an aerosol treatment for bronchial asthma.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
