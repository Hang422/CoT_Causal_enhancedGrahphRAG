Vitamin B9\nopb. Vitamin B12\nopc. Vitamin B6\nopd. Vitamin B3\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nIsoniazid is known to interfere with the metabolism of vitamin B6 (pyridoxine), leading to decreased levels and an increased risk of deficiency. This is particularly important as vitamin B6 is crucial for various metabolic processes, including the synthesis of neurotransmitters. The reasoning chains consistently indicate that isoniazid use is associated with a higher likelihood of vitamin B6 deficiency, supported by evidence that pyridoxine treats peripheral neuropathy, a condition that can arise from its deficiency. Therefore, the most likely vitamin deficiency seen in patients on isoniazid is vitamin B6.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Isoniazid is a first-line medication used in the treatment of tuberculosis, but it is known to interfere with the metabolism of vitamin B6 (pyridoxine). This interference can lead to a deficiency of vitamin B6, which is critical for various metabolic processes, including the synthesis of neurotransmitters. The association between isoniazid and vitamin B6 deficiency is well-documented, and patients on isoniazid are often supplemented with pyridoxine to prevent this deficiency and its associated complications, such as peripheral neuropathy. Other vitamins listed (B9, B12, and B3) are not directly affected by isoniazid in the same manner. Therefore, the most likely vitamin deficiency seen in patients on isoniazid is vitamin B6.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opc\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
