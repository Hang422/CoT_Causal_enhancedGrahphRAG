Androgen binding protein\nopb. Testosterone\nopc. LH\nopd. FSH\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nSertoli cells are crucial for spermatogenesis and secrete androgen-binding protein (ABP), which binds testosterone and facilitates its action on germ cells. The consensus indicates that Sertoli cells are stimulated by FSH, which promotes spermatogenesis and indirectly influences testosterone levels. They also respond to testosterone, supporting spermatogenesis and producing ABP. While Sertoli cells can influence LH secretion, their primary secretory product is ABP, not testosterone, LH, or FSH directly. Therefore, the most accurate option is 'Androgen binding protein' as the primary secretion of Sertoli cells.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Sertoli cells play a vital role in the process of spermatogenesis and are known to secrete androgen-binding protein (ABP). This protein binds to testosterone, which is essential for the maturation of sperm cells. While Sertoli cells are influenced by follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and respond to testosterone, they do not secrete testosterone, luteinizing hormone (LH), or follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) directly. The primary secretory product of Sertoli cells is indeed androgen-binding protein. Therefore, based on the consensus and the enhanced information provided, the most accurate answer is 'Androgen binding protein'.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
