Morphine\nopb. Dextromethorphan\nopc. Diphenhydramine\nopd. Aprepitant\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nDextromethorphan is an NMDA receptor antagonist, which can lead to dissociative effects and possible hallucinations, making it a significant risk factor for this side effect. Diphenhydramine, an anticholinergic agent, can cause CNS effects including confusion, which may predispose individuals to hallucinations, although this is less common. Morphine, an opioid receptor agonist, can cause CNS depression and altered mental status, which may also lead to hallucinations, but this is less frequently reported compared to the other two. Aprepitant, a substance P/neurokinin 1 receptor antagonist, is not commonly associated with hallucinations and is unlikely to cause this effect. Therefore, the antitussives most likely to lead to hallucinations are Dextromethorphan and Diphenhydramine.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Dextromethorphan is well-documented as an NMDA receptor antagonist, and at high doses, it can lead to dissociative effects and hallucinations. This is a significant risk factor for this side effect, especially in recreational use. Diphenhydramine, while primarily an antihistamine, has anticholinergic properties that can lead to CNS effects, including confusion and, in some cases, hallucinations, particularly in the elderly or at high doses. Morphine, an opioid, can cause altered mental status and hallucinations, but this is less frequently reported compared to Dextromethorphan. Aprepitant is not associated with hallucinations. Given the evidence, Dextromethorphan is the most likely antitussive to lead to hallucinations, with Diphenhydramine being a secondary consideration. Therefore, the best-supported option is Dextromethorphan.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
