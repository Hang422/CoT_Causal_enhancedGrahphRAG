Selenium\nopb. Phosphorus\nopc. Boron\nopd. Zinc\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nCardiomyopathy can be associated with deficiencies in certain nutrients, particularly selenium and zinc. Selenium deficiency is linked to increased oxidative stress and myocardial damage, which can lead to cardiomyopathy, supported by consensus in the literature. Zinc deficiency may impair immune function and increase inflammation, potentially resulting in heart muscle damage and cardiomyopathy. Phosphorus deficiency disrupts energy metabolism, which is crucial for cardiac function, and can also contribute to cardiomyopathy. However, the link between boron deficiency and cardiomyopathy is unclear and not well-established in the literature. Therefore, the most relevant deficiencies associated with cardiomyopathy are selenium and zinc, with phosphorus also being a contributing factor.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Cardiomyopathy can be associated with deficiencies in several nutrients, particularly selenium, zinc, and phosphorus. Selenium deficiency is well-documented in the literature as a cause of cardiomyopathy due to its role in reducing oxidative stress and maintaining myocardial health. Zinc deficiency is also linked to cardiomyopathy through its effects on immune function and inflammation. Phosphorus is crucial for energy metabolism in cardiac cells, and its deficiency can disrupt cardiac function, potentially leading to cardiomyopathy. While boron is mentioned, its connection to cardiomyopathy is not well-established. Given the strong evidence supporting selenium and zinc, and the role of phosphorus, the most likely correct answer is selenium, as it has a direct and well-supported link to the condition. Therefore, the best-supported option is selenium (opa).\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
