Chlorothiazide\nopb. Beta blockers\nopc. ACE inhibitors\nopd. Amlodipine\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nSpironolactone is a potassium-sparing diuretic that increases potassium levels, leading to a risk of hyperkalemia. Among the options: \n- Chlorothiazide is a thiazide diuretic that decreases potassium levels, thus it is not contraindicated with spironolactone. \n- Beta blockers do not significantly affect potassium levels and are also not contraindicated. \n- ACE inhibitors can increase potassium levels and may lead to hyperkalemia when used with spironolactone, making them potentially contraindicated. \n- Amlodipine does not affect potassium levels and is not contraindicated. \nTherefore, the drug most likely contraindicated with spironolactone is ACE inhibitors due to the risk of hyperkalemia.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Spironolactone is a potassium-sparing diuretic that can lead to elevated potassium levels (hyperkalemia). Among the options provided, chlorothiazide is a thiazide diuretic that actually lowers potassium levels, making it safe to use with spironolactone. Beta blockers do not significantly influence potassium levels and are also safe to use. Amlodipine, a calcium channel blocker, does not affect potassium levels either. However, ACE inhibitors can increase potassium levels and, when combined with spironolactone, pose a significant risk of hyperkalemia. Therefore, the most likely contraindicated drug when used with spironolactone is an ACE inhibitor. This aligns with the consensus in pharmacology regarding the risk of hyperkalemia when these two classes of drugs are used together.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opc\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}",
