Propanolol\nopb. Oral contraceptives\nopc. Reserpine\nopd. Flupenthixol\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nPropranolol is primarily used for anxiety and is not typically associated with depression, making it the least likely option to cause depressive symptoms. Oral contraceptives can influence mood due to hormonal changes, and while some users may experience depression, it is not a common side effect. Reserpine is known to deplete monoamines and is associated with depressive symptoms, making it likely to cause depression. Flupenthixol, an antipsychotic, can also lead to depressive symptoms, as it is known to cause such effects in some patients. Therefore, the best-supported conclusion is that depression is not a side effect of Propranolol.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"To determine which option is least likely to cause depression, we analyze each medication's known side effects. Propranolol (opa) is a beta-blocker primarily used for anxiety and hypertension; it is not commonly associated with depression. Oral contraceptives (opb) can influence mood due to hormonal changes, and while some users may experience depressive symptoms, it is not a prevalent side effect. Reserpine (opc) is known to deplete monoamines, which can lead to depression, making it likely to cause depressive symptoms. Flupenthixol (opd), an antipsychotic, can also lead to depressive symptoms in some patients. Given this analysis, Propranolol is the least likely to cause depression, aligning with the consensus that it is not typically associated with depressive side effects.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}",
