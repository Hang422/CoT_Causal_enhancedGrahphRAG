Methimazole\nopb. Propylthiouraril\nopc. Carbimazole\nopd. Perchlorate\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nIn the management of hyperthyroidism during the first trimester of pregnancy, Propylthiouracil (PTU) is the preferred drug due to its better safety profile compared to Methimazole, which is associated with teratogenic effects. Carbimazole, a pro-drug of Methimazole, shares similar risks. Perchlorate is not commonly used in this context. The consensus emphasizes minimizing fetal harm, particularly in early pregnancy, making PTU the drug of choice. Evidence supports that PTU has a lower risk of teratogenicity, aligning with the need for cautious pharmacological intervention during this critical developmental period.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "
