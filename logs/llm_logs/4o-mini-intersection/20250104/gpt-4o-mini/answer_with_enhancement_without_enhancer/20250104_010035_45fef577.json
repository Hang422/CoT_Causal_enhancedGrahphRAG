Propanolol\nopb. Aiprazolam\nopc. Buspirone\nopd. Haloperidol\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nPropranolol is used for performance anxiety and can reduce physical symptoms associated with anxiety, making it relevant in certain anxiety contexts. Alprazolam is a benzodiazepine commonly prescribed for anxiety disorders, aligning with standard treatment guidelines. Buspirone is an anxiolytic specifically indicated for generalized anxiety disorder, confirming its use in anxiety treatment. Haloperidol, an antipsychotic, is not primarily indicated for anxiety and is used for conditions like schizophrenia and acute psychosis, which is supported by the consensus that it is not a first-line treatment for anxiety. Therefore, Haloperidol is the drug not used for anxiety treatment.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"In evaluating the options provided, we consider the primary uses of each medication in relation to anxiety treatment. Propranolol (opa) is often used for performance anxiety and can help manage physical symptoms associated with anxiety, though it is not a first-line treatment for generalized anxiety disorder. Alprazolam (opb) is a benzodiazepine that is widely prescribed for anxiety disorders, making it a common choice in anxiety management. Buspirone (opc) is specifically indicated for generalized anxiety disorder, confirming its role in treating anxiety. Haloperidol (opd), on the other hand, is an antipsychotic medication primarily used for treating schizophrenia and acute psychosis, and it is not indicated for anxiety disorders. Therefore, based on the consensus in pharmacology, Haloperidol is the drug that is not used for anxiety treatment.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
