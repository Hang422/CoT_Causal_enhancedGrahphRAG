ENL\nopb. HIV neuropathy\nopc. HIV associated ulcer\nopd. Behcet's syndrome\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nThalidomide is primarily used for treating erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) and Behcet's syndrome, where it helps reduce inflammatory symptoms. It is not indicated for HIV neuropathy or HIV-associated ulcers, as there is limited evidence supporting its efficacy in these conditions. Therefore, the correct answer to the question is that Thalidomide is used in all except for HIV neuropathy and HIV-associated ulcers.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Thalidomide is primarily indicated for conditions such as erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) and Behcet's syndrome due to its anti-inflammatory properties. The enhanced information confirms that it is not used for HIV neuropathy or HIV-associated ulcers, as there is insufficient evidence supporting its efficacy in these conditions. Therefore, the correct answer to the question is that Thalidomide is used in all except for HIV neuropathy and HIV-associated ulcers. Among the options provided, the most appropriate choice is 'HIV neuropathy' as it is explicitly mentioned as not being an indication for Thalidomide. Thus, the best-supported option is opb (HIV neuropathy).\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}",
