Single dose in ascariasis\nopb. Immunostimulant\nopc. Paralysis of worms by depolarisation\nopd. Immunodepressant in high doses\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nLevamisole is primarily an anthelmintic used to treat ascariasis, typically administered in a single dose, which is effective for this purpose. It acts by causing paralysis of worms through a depolarization mechanism, making it effective against certain helminths. While Levamisole is known to enhance immune response and is used as an immunostimulant, high doses can lead to immunosuppressive effects, which is not its primary indication. Therefore, the option stating that Levamisole is used as an immunodepressant in high doses is incorrect, as this is not its intended use. The evidence supports its role in treating infections and enhancing immunity, but not as a primary immunodepressant.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "
