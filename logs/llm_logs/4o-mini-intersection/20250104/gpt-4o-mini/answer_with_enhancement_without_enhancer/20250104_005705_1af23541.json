Carbamazepine\nopb. Vigabatrin\nopc. Sodium valproate\nopd. Lamotrigine\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nCarbamazepine, sodium valproate, and lamotrigine are all approved and indicated for the treatment of bipolar disorder, as they are effective in mood stabilization. Vigabatrin, however, is primarily used for the treatment of epilepsy and is not indicated for bipolar disorder. The reasoning chains for carbamazepine, sodium valproate, and lamotrigine align with established guidelines, while the chains for vigabatrin correctly highlight its lack of indication for bipolar disorder. Therefore, the correct answer is Vigabatrin, as it does not have a role in the treatment of bipolar disorder.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"In the treatment of bipolar disorder, mood stabilizers and certain anticonvulsants are commonly used. Carbamazepine, sodium valproate, and lamotrigine are all recognized as effective treatments for managing mood episodes in bipolar disorder. In contrast, vigabatrin is primarily indicated for the treatment of epilepsy and does not have a recognized role in the management of bipolar disorder. Therefore, based on established medical guidelines and consensus, the drug that is not indicated for the treatment of bipolar disorder is vigabatrin.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
