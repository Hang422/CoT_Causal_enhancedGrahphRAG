Glucocoicoids\nopb. Mineralcoicoids\nopc. Aldosterone\nopd. Androgens\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nThe zona reticularis of the adrenal cortex primarily produces androgens, which are sex hormones. This is supported by the consensus that the adrenal cortex is divided into three zones: the zona glomerulosa (producing mineralocorticoids), the zona fasciculata (producing glucocorticoids), and the zona reticularis (producing androgens). The main androgen produced is dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA). Therefore, the correct answer is 'Androgens'.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The adrenal cortex is divided into three distinct zones, each responsible for producing different classes of hormones. The zona glomerulosa primarily produces mineralocorticoids, such as aldosterone. The zona fasciculata is responsible for glucocorticoids, like cortisol. The zona reticularis, which is the focus of this question, is known to produce androgens, including dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA). Given this established understanding of adrenal physiology, the major hormone secreted by the zona reticularis is indeed androgens. Therefore, the correct answer is 'Androgens'.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
