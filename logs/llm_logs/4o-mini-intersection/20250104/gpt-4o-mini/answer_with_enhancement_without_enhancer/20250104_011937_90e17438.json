Fever\nopb. Peptic ulcer\nopc. Unstable angina\nopd. Myalgia\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nAspirin is contraindicated in peptic ulcer due to its potential to cause gastrointestinal irritation and increase the risk of bleeding, which can complicate existing ulcers. This is supported by the consensus that aspirin can exacerbate peptic ulcer disease. In contrast, aspirin is not contraindicated in myalgia, as it is often used to reduce inflammation associated with muscle pain. While aspirin can cause Reye's syndrome in children, leading to a contraindication in fever in pediatric patients, this is not a general contraindication for fever in adults. Aspirin is beneficial in unstable angina as it provides cardiovascular protection, thus it is not contraindicated in this condition.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Aspirin is known to cause gastrointestinal irritation and increase the risk of bleeding, which makes it contraindicated in patients with peptic ulcers. This is a well-established medical principle. In contrast, while aspirin can cause Reye's syndrome in children when given for fever, this is not a contraindication for adults. Aspirin is also used in the management of unstable angina to provide cardiovascular protection, and it is not contraindicated in myalgia as it can help alleviate pain and inflammation. Therefore, the most appropriate answer based on the consensus is that aspirin is contraindicated in peptic ulcer disease.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
