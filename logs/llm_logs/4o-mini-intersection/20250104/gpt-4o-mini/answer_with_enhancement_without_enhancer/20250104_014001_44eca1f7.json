Tamsulosin\nopb. Prazosin\nopc. Oxazocin\nopd. Dolazoline\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nAlpha-1 adrenergic blockers are effective in providing symptomatic relief in Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH) by relaxing smooth muscle in the prostate and urethra, thereby reducing urinary obstruction. Tamsulosin is a selective alpha-1A blocker that specifically decreases resistance in the prostatic urethra, leading to improved urinary flow and significant symptomatic relief in BPH. Prazosin, while an alpha-1 blocker, is less selective and primarily used for hypertension, which may limit its efficacy in BPH. Oxazocin is also an alpha-1 blocker but is less commonly used and has unclear efficacy in BPH. Dolazoline, an alpha-2 adrenergic agonist, is not primarily indicated for BPH and is unlikely to provide symptomatic relief. Therefore, Tamsulosin is the most effective option for symptomatic relief in BPH, supported by its mechanism of action and clinical use.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "
