Clindamycin\nopb. Cefepime\nopc. Metronidazole\nopd. Azithromycin\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nThe drug of choice for gonococcal urethritis is ceftriaxone, which is a first-line cephalosporin antibiotic. For non-gonococcal urethritis, azithromycin is commonly recommended due to its effectiveness against Chlamydia. While cefepime is also a cephalosporin, it is not first-line for urethritis. Azithromycin is effective for both types of urethritis, making it the preferred choice for non-gonococcal cases. Therefore, azithromycin is the drug of choice for non-gonococcal urethritis, while ceftriaxone is for gonococcal urethritis. The consensus supports the use of ceftriaxone for gonococcal and azithromycin for non-gonococcal urethritis.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The question asks for the drug of choice for both gonococcal and non-gonococcal urethritis. Gonococcal urethritis is typically treated with ceftriaxone, while non-gonococcal urethritis is often treated with azithromycin, especially for infections caused by Chlamydia. The options provided include clindamycin, cefepime, metronidazole, and azithromycin. Clindamycin and metronidazole are not first-line treatments for either type of urethritis. Cefepime, while a cephalosporin, is not the first-line treatment for urethritis. Azithromycin is effective for non-gonococcal urethritis and is often used in combination with ceftriaxone for gonococcal urethritis. Therefore, azithromycin is the best-supported option for non-gonococcal urethritis, and while it is not the drug of choice for gonococcal urethritis, it is the only option listed that is effective for one of the two types of urethritis. Thus, azithromycin is the most appropriate answer given the options.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
