Arachidonic acid\nopb. Cholesterol\nopc. Palmitic acid\nopd. Stearic acid\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nArachidonic acid is an unsaturated fatty acid that can increase membrane fluidity due to its kinked structure, which prevents tight packing of phospholipids, thus enhancing cell signaling. Cholesterol, while important for maintaining membrane integrity, actually decreases fluidity at high concentrations by filling spaces between phospholipids, leading to increased rigidity. Both palmitic acid and stearic acid are saturated fatty acids, which contribute to decreased membrane fluidity and increased rigidity due to their straight-chain structure that allows for tight packing. Therefore, the correct answer to the question regarding which substance increases plasma membrane fluidity is 'Arachidonic acid.'\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The fluidity of the plasma membrane is influenced by the types of fatty acids and other molecules present. Arachidonic acid, being an unsaturated fatty acid, has a kinked structure that prevents tight packing of phospholipids, thereby increasing membrane fluidity. In contrast, cholesterol can decrease fluidity at high concentrations by filling spaces between phospholipids, leading to increased rigidity. Both palmitic acid and stearic acid are saturated fatty acids, which promote tight packing and thus decrease fluidity. Given this information, the most supported option for increasing plasma membrane fluidity is indeed arachidonic acid.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}",
