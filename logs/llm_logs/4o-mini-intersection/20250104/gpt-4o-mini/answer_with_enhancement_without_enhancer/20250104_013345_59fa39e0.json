Thiothixanthene\nopb. Phenothiazine\nopc. Butyrophenone\nopd. Diphenyl butyl piperidine\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nPimozide is an antipsychotic medication primarily used to treat Tourette syndrome. It is classified as a butyrophenone, which is a specific class of antipsychotic drugs. The reasoning chains confirm that Pimozide acts as a dopamine receptor antagonist, aligning with its classification as a butyrophenone. It is not classified under phenothiazines, thiothixanthenes, or diphenyl butyl piperidines. The evidence paths support its role as an antipsychotic agent and its interaction with dopamine antagonists, reinforcing its classification. Therefore, the correct answer is that Pimozide belongs to the butyrophenone class.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Pimozide is an antipsychotic medication that is primarily used to treat Tourette syndrome. It is classified as a butyrophenone, which is a specific class of antipsychotic drugs known for their dopamine receptor antagonism. The other options provided (thiothixanthene, phenothiazine, and diphenyl butyl piperidine) represent different classes of antipsychotic medications that do not include pimozide. The enhanced information confirms that pimozide's mechanism of action and classification align with the butyrophenone class. Therefore, the most accurate classification for pimozide is as a butyrophenone.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opc\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
