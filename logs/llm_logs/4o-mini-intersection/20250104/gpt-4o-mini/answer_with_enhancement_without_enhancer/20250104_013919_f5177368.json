Retinol\nopb. Retinal\nopc. Retinoic acids\nopd. All of the above\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nVitamin A is essential for various biological functions and exists in several forms, including retinol, retinal, and retinoic acids. Each of these forms plays a critical role in vision, gene expression, immune function, and skin health. Retinal is a key component of rhodopsin, which is crucial for phototransduction in the retina. Retinoic acids function as hormones that regulate gene transcription, while retinol is important for immune cell function and skin health. Therefore, all forms of vitamin A are functionally related and contribute to these essential processes. The evidence paths confirm the involvement of vitamin A in retinal health and its broader implications in various biological systems, supporting the conclusion that all forms of vitamin A are relevant to its functions.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Vitamin A is a crucial nutrient that exists in several forms, including retinol, retinal, and retinoic acids. Each of these forms has distinct but interrelated functions in the body. Retinol is important for immune function and skin health, retinal is essential for vision as it is a component of rhodopsin, and retinoic acids play a significant role in gene expression and cellular differentiation. Given that all these forms contribute to the overall functions of vitamin A, the most accurate answer is that all of them are related to the functions of vitamin A. Therefore, the best-supported option is 'All of the above.'\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
