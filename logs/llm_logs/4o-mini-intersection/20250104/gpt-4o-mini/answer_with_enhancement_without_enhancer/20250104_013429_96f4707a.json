Endometrial carcinoma\nopc. >Carcinoma in contralateral breast\nopd. >Cataract\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nTamoxifen is associated with several adverse effects. It is well-documented that tamoxifen increases the risk of thromboembolism, which is a known adverse effect (CHAIN: 95%). Additionally, there is a recognized increased risk of endometrial carcinoma in women taking tamoxifen (CHAIN: 90%). The risk of carcinoma in the contralateral breast is less clear; while some studies suggest a possible association, it is not as strongly established as the other effects (CHAIN: 80%). Cataract development is also noted as a less commonly associated adverse effect (CHAIN: 70%). Therefore, the most accurate conclusion is that while thromboembolism, endometrial carcinoma, and cataracts are recognized adverse effects, carcinoma in the contralateral breast is less definitively linked to tamoxifen use, making it the exception among the listed options.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Tamoxifen is a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) commonly used in the treatment of estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer. It is associated with several adverse effects. The known adverse effects include an increased risk of thromboembolism (opa), which is well-documented, and an increased risk of endometrial carcinoma (opb), which is also a recognized risk. Cataracts (opd) have been reported as a potential adverse effect, although they are less commonly discussed. The risk of carcinoma in the contralateral breast (opc) is less clearly established compared to the other effects. While some studies suggest a possible association, it is not as strongly supported as the risks of thromboembolism and endometrial carcinoma. Therefore, among the options provided, carcinoma in the contralateral breast is the least definitively linked to tamoxifen use, making it the exception. Thus, the most likely correct answer is option 'opc'.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opc\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
