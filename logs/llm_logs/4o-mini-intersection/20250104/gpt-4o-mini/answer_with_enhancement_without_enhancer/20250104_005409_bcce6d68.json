Nimodipine\nopb. Amlodipine\nopc. Diltiazem\nopd. Verapamil\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nNimodipine is specifically indicated for the prevention of cerebral vasospasm following subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). The risk of vasospasm is a significant complication in SAH, occurring in 30-70% of patients, which can lead to further neurological deficits. Nimodipine, a calcium channel blocker, has been shown to improve cerebral blood flow and is the only calcium channel blocker recommended for this purpose. Other calcium channel blockers such as Amlodipine, Diltiazem, and Verapamil are not specifically indicated for vasospasm prevention and are less effective than Nimodipine in this context. Therefore, the correct choice for drug therapy in the case of subarachnoid hemorrhage is Nimodipine.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

Nimodipine is a calcium channel blocker that has been specifically studied and shown to be effective in preventing cerebral vasospasm in patients who have experienced SAH. The other options listed (Amlodipine, Diltiazem, and Verapamil) are also calcium channel blockers but are not indicated for this specific purpose and do not have the same level of evidence supporting their use in the context of SAH. Therefore, based on the consensus in medical literature, Nimodipine is the most appropriate choice for this condition.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
