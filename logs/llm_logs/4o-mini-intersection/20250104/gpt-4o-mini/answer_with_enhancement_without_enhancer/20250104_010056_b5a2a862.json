Duodenum\nopb. Ileum\nopc. Jejunum\nopd. Colon\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nVitamin B12 absorption requires intrinsic factor, which is produced in the stomach and binds to vitamin B12. The intrinsic factor-B12 complex then travels to the ileum, where absorption occurs. This is supported by multiple reasoning chains indicating that the ileum is the primary site for vitamin B12 absorption. Evidence paths also confirm the role of intrinsic factor in the uptake of vitamin B12 in the ileum, reinforcing that the correct answer is the ileum.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Vitamin B12 absorption is a complex process that begins in the stomach, where intrinsic factor is produced. The intrinsic factor then binds to vitamin B12, forming a complex that is essential for the absorption of vitamin B12. This complex travels through the gastrointestinal tract and is specifically absorbed in the ileum, which is the final section of the small intestine. The duodenum and jejunum do not play a significant role in the absorption of vitamin B12, and the colon is not involved in this process. Therefore, the consensus in medical literature clearly indicates that the ileum is the primary site for vitamin B12 absorption facilitated by intrinsic factor. Given this information, the most likely correct answer is the ileum.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
