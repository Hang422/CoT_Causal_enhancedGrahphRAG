Collecting duct\nopb. Glomerulus\nopc. Proximal convoluted tubule\nopd. Loop of Henle\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nAldosterone is a hormone secreted by the adrenal glands that plays a crucial role in regulating sodium and potassium levels in the body. Its primary action occurs in the kidneys, specifically at the collecting duct of the nephron, where it promotes sodium reabsorption and increases water retention. This mechanism is essential for maintaining fluid balance and blood pressure. The reasoning chains consistently point to the collecting duct as the main site of aldosterone action, supported by the consensus that aldosterone primarily influences renal tubules, particularly the collecting duct, to regulate electrolyte balance.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

Its main action occurs in the kidneys, specifically at the collecting duct of the nephron. Aldosterone promotes sodium reabsorption and potassium excretion, which is crucial for maintaining blood pressure and fluid balance. While it may have some effects on other parts of the nephron, such as the distal convoluted tubule, the consensus in medical literature strongly supports that the primary site of action for aldosterone is the collecting duct. Therefore, the best-supported option is the collecting duct.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
