Patient gives history of recurrent bacterial infections. Ophthalmic examination reveals white triangular plaques on conjunctiva. This patient is suffering from deficiency of:\n\n                    ### Options\n                    opa. Vitamin D\nopb. Vitamin B\nopc. Vitamin A\nopd. Vitamin C\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nThe patient's symptoms of diminished vision during night (night blindness), dryness of eyes (xerophthalmia), and recurrent bacterial infections strongly indicate a deficiency of Vitamin A. Night blindness is a classic sign of Vitamin A deficiency, as this vitamin is crucial for the synthesis of rhodopsin, a pigment in the retina that is essential for low-light vision. Xerophthalmia, characterized by dryness of the conjunctiva and cornea, is also associated with Vitamin A deficiency and can lead to the formation of Bitot's spots, which are white triangular plaques on the conjunctiva. Furthermore, Vitamin A plays a vital role in maintaining immune function, and its deficiency can lead to increased susceptibility to infections. Therefore, the evidence supports that the patient is suffering from Vitamin A deficiency.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The patient's symptoms of diminished vision during the night (night blindness), dryness of eyes (xerophthalmia), and recurrent bacterial infections are classic indicators of Vitamin A deficiency. Night blindness occurs due to the impaired synthesis of rhodopsin, which is essential for vision in low-light conditions, and xerophthalmia is a direct result of Vitamin A's role in maintaining the health of epithelial tissues, including those in the eyes. The presence of white triangular plaques on the conjunctiva, known as Bitot's spots, further supports this diagnosis. Additionally, Vitamin A is crucial for immune function, and its deficiency can lead to increased susceptibility to infections, which aligns with the patient's history of recurrent bacterial infections. Therefore, the most likely correct answer is Vitamin A deficiency.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opc\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
