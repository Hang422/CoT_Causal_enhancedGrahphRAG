All of the following are true about heparin except-\n\n                    ### Options\n                    opa. Weakest acid found in living things\nopb. Most commercial preparations of heparin now utilize pig intestinal slimes\nopc. Act via Antithrombin activation\nopd. Produce thrombocytopenia\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nHeparin is a widely used anticoagulant that acts primarily by activating Antithrombin, which inhibits thrombin and factor Xa, confirming that option (opc) is true. Most commercial preparations of heparin are derived from pig intestinal mucosa, making option (opb) true as well. Heparin can indeed cause thrombocytopenia, a decrease in platelet count, thus option (opd) is also true. However, heparin is a polysaccharide and is not classified as an acid, which makes option (opa) incorrect. Therefore, the statement that heparin is the 'weakest acid found in living things' is false.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "
