HDL\nopb. LDL\nopc. VLDL\nopd. Chylomicrons\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nCholesterol is synthesized in the liver and needs to be transported to peripheral tissues. The primary lipoprotein responsible for this transport is Low-Density Lipoprotein (LDL), which delivers cholesterol to cells throughout the body. While Very Low-Density Lipoprotein (VLDL) is involved in transporting triglycerides, it is LDL that primarily carries cholesterol derived from the liver. High-Density Lipoprotein (HDL) plays a role in reverse cholesterol transport, removing excess cholesterol from tissues, but it is not the main transporter of liver-derived cholesterol. Chylomicrons are primarily responsible for transporting dietary lipids rather than cholesterol from the liver. Therefore, the correct answer is LDL.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Cholesterol transport from the liver to peripheral tissues is primarily mediated by Low-Density Lipoprotein (LDL). LDL is specifically designed to carry cholesterol that has been synthesized in the liver to various cells throughout the body, where it can be utilized for membrane synthesis, hormone production, and other essential functions. While High-Density Lipoprotein (HDL) is involved in reverse cholesterol transport, removing excess cholesterol from tissues back to the liver, it does not primarily transport cholesterol from the liver. Very Low-Density Lipoprotein (VLDL) mainly carries triglycerides, and chylomicrons are responsible for transporting dietary lipids rather than liver-derived cholesterol. Therefore, the consensus in the medical community supports that LDL is the main transporter of cholesterol from the liver to peripheral tissues.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
