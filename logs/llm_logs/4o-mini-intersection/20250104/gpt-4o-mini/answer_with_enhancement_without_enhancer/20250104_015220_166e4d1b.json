Discoid lupus erythematous\nopb. Rheumatoid ahritis\nopc. Infectious mononucleosis\nopd. All of the above\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nChloroquine is primarily known for its antimalarial properties and has established uses in treating certain autoimmune conditions. It is effective in discoid lupus erythematosus due to its immunomodulatory effects, and it is also used in rheumatoid arthritis for its anti-inflammatory properties. However, there is no evidence supporting its efficacy in treating infectious mononucleosis, which is caused by the Epstein-Barr virus. Therefore, the correct options are discoid lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis, but not infectious mononucleosis. Thus, the answer is not 'all of the above.'\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "
