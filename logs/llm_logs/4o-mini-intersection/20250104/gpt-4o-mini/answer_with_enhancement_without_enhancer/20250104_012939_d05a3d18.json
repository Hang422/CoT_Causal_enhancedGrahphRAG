Leydig cells\nopb. Seolie cells\nopc. Seminiferous tubules\nopd. Epididymis\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nTestosterone production is primarily attributed to Leydig cells, which are located in the interstitial space of the testes. Leydig cells synthesize testosterone in response to luteinizing hormone (LH) stimulation, making them the main contributors to testosterone production in males. Sertoli cells, found in the seminiferous tubules, support spermatogenesis but do not produce testosterone. The epididymis is involved in sperm maturation and does not produce hormones. Therefore, the correct answer is Leydig cells, as they are the primary source of testosterone in males.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Testosterone production in males is primarily carried out by Leydig cells, which are located in the interstitial space of the testes. These cells respond to luteinizing hormone (LH) from the anterior pituitary gland to synthesize testosterone. Sertoli cells, while crucial for supporting spermatogenesis, do not produce testosterone. The seminiferous tubules are the site of sperm production but are not involved in testosterone synthesis. The epididymis is responsible for the maturation and storage of sperm and does not produce hormones. Given this understanding, the consensus clearly identifies Leydig cells as the main contributors to testosterone production. Therefore, the most accurate answer is Leydig cells.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
