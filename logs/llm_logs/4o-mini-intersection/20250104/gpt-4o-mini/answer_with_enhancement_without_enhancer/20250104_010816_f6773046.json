Ascaris\nopb. Filariasis\nopc. Malaria\nopd. Oncocerciasis\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nIvermectin is an antiparasitic medication indicated for specific parasitic infections. It is effective against Onchocerciasis and Filariasis, both of which are caused by parasitic worms. However, Ivermectin is not indicated for Malaria, which is caused by Plasmodium species and requires different treatment. Additionally, while Ivermectin is sometimes mentioned in the context of Ascaris (a type of roundworm), it is not the primary treatment for Ascaris infections, which are typically treated with other anthelmintics like albendazole or mebendazole. Therefore, the correct answer is that Ivermectin is not indicated for Malaria.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Ivermectin is an antiparasitic medication that is primarily indicated for certain parasitic infections. It is well-established in the treatment of Onchocerciasis (river blindness) and Filariasis, both of which are caused by parasitic worms. While Ivermectin has some activity against certain nematodes, it is not the first-line treatment for Ascaris lumbricoides infections, which are typically treated with albendazole or mebendazole. Most importantly, Ivermectin is not indicated for Malaria, which is caused by Plasmodium species and requires antimalarial medications such as chloroquine or artemisinin-based therapies. Therefore, the option that Ivermectin is not indicated for is Malaria. This aligns with the consensus in pharmacology regarding the use of Ivermectin. Thus, the correct answer is option c (Malaria).\",\n  \"answer\": \"opc\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
