Flutamide\nopb. Finasteride\nopc. Prazosin\nopd. Minoxidil\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nFinasteride is a 5α-reductase inhibitor that effectively reduces dihydrotestosterone (DHT) levels, which is beneficial in treating benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH) and male pattern baldness (androgenetic alopecia). The reasoning chains confirm that Finasteride is indicated for both conditions, aligning with medical consensus. Evidence paths support that Finasteride treats androgenetic alopecia and is commonly used for BPH, reinforcing its dual indication. Other options, such as Flutamide, Prazosin, and Minoxidil, do not have this dual indication, confirming that Finasteride is the correct answer.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Finasteride is a well-established 5α-reductase inhibitor that effectively lowers dihydrotestosterone (DHT) levels. It is clinically indicated for the treatment of benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH) and is also approved for the treatment of male pattern baldness (androgenetic alopecia). The other options listed do not share this dual indication: Flutamide is an anti-androgen primarily used for prostate cancer, Prazosin is an alpha-1 blocker used for hypertension and BPH but does not affect DHT, and Minoxidil is a vasodilator used for hypertension and topical treatment of hair loss but is not a 5α-reductase inhibitor. Therefore, based on the consensus in pharmacology, Finasteride is the correct answer for both conditions.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
