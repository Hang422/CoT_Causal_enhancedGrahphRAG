Pirenzepine\nopb. Loratadine\nopc. Misoprostol\nopd. Esomeprazole\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nChronic NSAID use leads to increased gastric acid secretion and inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis, resulting in reduced mucosal protection and a higher risk of peptic ulcer disease. Misoprostol, a prostaglandin analog, is indicated for the prevention and treatment of NSAID-induced peptic ulcers due to its ability to enhance mucosal defense and promote healing. The reasoning chains supporting Misoprostol as the drug of choice are consistent with this consensus, particularly emphasizing its role in providing mucosal protection. Other options, such as Pirenzepine and Loratadine, are not indicated for this condition, while Esomeprazole, a proton pump inhibitor, may be used but is not the first-line choice specifically for NSAID-induced ulcers. Therefore, Misoprostol is the most appropriate choice.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "
