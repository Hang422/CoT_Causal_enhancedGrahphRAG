Can be used in absence seizures\nopb. Can be mixed with saline\nopc. Can be given orally\nopd. It is the drug of choice for myoclonic seizures\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nFosphenytoin is a prodrug of phenytoin, converted to phenytoin in the body, and shares similar efficacy in treating seizures. However, it is not typically used for absence seizures, which are better treated with other agents like ethosuximide. Fosphenytoin is soluble in saline, making it easier to administer intravenously, which is a significant advantage over phenytoin. Both fosphenytoin and phenytoin can be given orally, but fosphenytoin is not the drug of choice for myoclonic seizures, as phenytoin is generally not effective for this type of seizure. Therefore, the correct distinctions are that fosphenytoin can be mixed with saline and is not the drug of choice for myoclonic seizures.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Fosphenytoin is a prodrug of phenytoin and is primarily used for the same indications as phenytoin, but it has some distinct advantages. It is important to note that fosphenytoin is not effective for absence seizures, which are better treated with other medications. Fosphenytoin can be mixed with saline, which is a significant advantage over phenytoin, which cannot be mixed with saline due to its solubility issues. Both fosphenytoin and phenytoin can be administered orally. However, fosphenytoin is not the drug of choice for myoclonic seizures, as phenytoin is generally not effective for this type of seizure either. Therefore, the most accurate distinction is that fosphenytoin can be mixed with saline, making option opb the correct choice. The other options either misrepresent the uses of fosphenytoin or are not distinguishing factors. Thus, the best-supported option is opb.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}",
