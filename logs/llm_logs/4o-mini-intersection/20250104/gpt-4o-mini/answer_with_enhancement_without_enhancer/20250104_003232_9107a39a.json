Morphine patch\nopb. Diazepam\nopc. Clobazam\nopd. Haloperidol\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nIn palliative care for lung cancer patients experiencing dyspnoea, the use of a morphine patch is supported by consensus as it effectively decreases the perception of breathlessness, leading to reduced dyspnoea. This aligns with evidence indicating that morphine can prevent dyspnoea. Diazepam and clobazam, while having anxiolytic effects that may improve comfort by reducing anxiety related to dyspnoea, are less effective than morphine in directly alleviating dyspnoea. Haloperidol's role is unclear, as its antipsychotic effects do not have a well-established impact on dyspnoea. Therefore, the most effective option for palliation of dyspnoea in this context is the morphine patch.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"In the context of palliative care for lung cancer patients suffering from dyspnoea, the primary goal is to alleviate the sensation of breathlessness effectively. Morphine is well-documented in the literature as a first-line treatment for dyspnoea, particularly in patients with advanced cancer. The use of a morphine patch provides a continuous delivery of the medication, which can help manage dyspnoea by reducing the perception of breathlessness. While diazepam and clobazam may help with anxiety, they do not directly address the physiological aspects of dyspnoea as effectively as morphine. Haloperidol, an antipsychotic, does not have a clear role in the management of dyspnoea. Therefore, the consensus strongly supports the use of a morphine patch for palliation of dyspnoea in this patient population, making it the most appropriate choice.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
