This hormone is produced in which one of the following anatomical locations?\n\n                    ### Options\n                    opa. Hypothalamus\nopb. Anterior pituitary\nopc. Posterior pituitary\nopd. Adrenal cortex\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nOxytocin is a hormone that plays a crucial role in stimulating uterine contractions during labor. It is produced in the hypothalamus and released from the posterior pituitary gland. The reasoning chains consistently indicate that oxytocin is key for uterine contractions and originates from the posterior pituitary, which aligns with established medical consensus. The retrieved evidence paths confirm the anatomical location of oxytocin production, specifically highlighting the posterior pituitary's role. Therefore, the correct answer is that oxytocin, the hormone responsible for uterine contractions, is produced in the posterior pituitary.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Oxytocin is the hormone responsible for stimulating uterine contractions during labor. It is synthesized in the hypothalamus and then transported to the posterior pituitary gland, where it is stored and released into the bloodstream. The question specifically asks for the anatomical location of production, which is the hypothalamus. However, since the posterior pituitary is where oxytocin is released from, it is important to clarify that while the production occurs in the hypothalamus, the posterior pituitary is the site of release. Given the options provided, the most accurate answer regarding the anatomical location of oxytocin's production is the hypothalamus. Therefore, the best-supported option is 'opa'.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
