Directly simulated by fall in PaO2\nopb. Connected with cardiac center\nopc. Inhibited during swallowing\nopd. Situated in midbrain\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nThe respiratory center, primarily located in the medulla oblongata and pons (not midbrain), regulates breathing by monitoring blood gases, particularly responding to a fall in PaO2 to stimulate increased ventilation. It is also connected with the cardiac center to coordinate respiratory and cardiac functions. During swallowing, the respiratory center is inhibited to prevent aspiration, which is a reflex action. Therefore, the correct statements regarding the respiratory center are that it is directly influenced by changes in PaO2, connected with the cardiac center, and inhibited during swallowing. However, it is not situated in the midbrain.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The respiratory center is primarily located in the medulla oblongata and pons, not the midbrain, which makes option opd incorrect. It is indeed directly stimulated by a fall in PaO2, which aligns with option opa. The respiratory center is also connected with the cardiac center to coordinate functions, supporting option opb. Additionally, during swallowing, the respiratory center is inhibited to prevent aspiration, confirming option opc. However, since the question asks for a 'true' statement regarding the respiratory center, the most accurate option is that it is directly stimulated by a fall in PaO2 (option opa). Therefore, while multiple options have elements of truth, option opa is the most straightforwardly correct based on standard physiology.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}",
