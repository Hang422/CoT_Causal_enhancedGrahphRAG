Vasopressin\nopb. Terlipressin\nopc. Desmopressin\nopd. Pralipressin\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nNeurogenic diabetes insipidus is characterized by insufficient production of antidiuretic hormone (ADH), leading to excessive urination. The drug of choice for this condition is Desmopressin, a synthetic analog of vasopressin (ADH), which effectively mimics its action and reduces urine output. Desmopressin is preferred due to its efficacy and safety profile compared to other options like vasopressin, terlipressin, and pralipressin. Evidence supports that Desmopressin is effective in managing symptoms of neurogenic diabetes insipidus, making it the standard treatment. The retrieved evidence regarding Deamino Arginine Vasopressin (another name for Desmopressin) confirms its role in replacement therapy for this condition.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Neurogenic diabetes insipidus is caused by a deficiency in the production of antidiuretic hormone (ADH), leading to excessive urination. The primary treatment for this condition is to replace or mimic the action of ADH. Desmopressin, a synthetic analog of vasopressin, is specifically designed to treat neurogenic diabetes insipidus by effectively reducing urine output and is preferred due to its favorable safety profile and efficacy. Other options like vasopressin, terlipressin, and pralipressin are not as commonly used for this specific indication. The consensus in medical literature supports Desmopressin as the drug of choice for managing neurogenic diabetes insipidus, making it the most appropriate answer.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opc\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
