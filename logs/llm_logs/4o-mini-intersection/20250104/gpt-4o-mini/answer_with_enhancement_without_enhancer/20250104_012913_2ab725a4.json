Aprepitant\nopb. Dexamethasone\nopc. Ondansetrin\nopd. All of the above\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nAprepitant is a substance P antagonist that effectively reduces nausea and vomiting associated with chemotherapy, making it a key agent in managing chemotherapy-induced vomiting. Dexamethasone, a corticosteroid, has anti-inflammatory properties that also help reduce nausea in chemotherapy settings, although it is not primarily an antiemetic. Ondansetron is a well-established 5-HT3 receptor antagonist that is commonly used to prevent nausea and vomiting in chemotherapy patients. Therefore, all three drugs—Aprepitant, Dexamethasone, and Ondansetron—are utilized in the management of chemotherapy-induced vomiting, supporting the option 'All of the above' as the correct answer.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"In the context of chemotherapy-induced vomiting, it is well-established that multiple pharmacological agents can be employed to manage this side effect. Aprepitant is a substance P antagonist that is effective in preventing nausea and vomiting associated with chemotherapy. Dexamethasone, while primarily a corticosteroid, has been shown to have antiemetic properties and is often used in combination with other antiemetics. Ondansetron is a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist that is widely recognized for its efficacy in preventing chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting. Given that all three drugs have roles in managing this condition, the most comprehensive answer is 'All of the above'. Therefore, the correct option is 'All of the above'.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}",
