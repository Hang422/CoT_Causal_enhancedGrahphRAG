Directly\nopb. IG1-1\nopc. Thyroxine\nopd. Intranuclear receptors\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nGrowth hormone (GH) primarily exerts its effects on growth through the stimulation of the liver to produce Insulin-like Growth Factor 1 (IGF-1), which promotes growth in various tissues, including bone and muscle. GH binds to specific receptors on target cells, activating signaling pathways that lead to increased cell proliferation and protein synthesis, further enhancing growth. While GH can influence growth plate activity and has some interaction with intranuclear receptors to modulate gene expression, its primary mechanism is through IGF-1. Therefore, the most accurate option is 'IGF-1' as it directly mediates the growth-promoting effects of GH.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "
