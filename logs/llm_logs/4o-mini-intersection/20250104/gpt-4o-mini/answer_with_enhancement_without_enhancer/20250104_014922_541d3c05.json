Chloroquine\nopb. Betamethasone\nopc. Chloramphenicol\nopd. Zidovudine\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nChloroquine is primarily used for malaria treatment and is not commonly associated with myopathy, making it a strong candidate for the drug that does not cause myopathy. Betamethasone, a corticosteroid, is known to potentially cause muscle weakness and is associated with myopathy. Chloramphenicol, while an antibiotic, has a rare association with myopathy, making it less likely to be the correct answer. Zidovudine is well-documented to cause myopathy, particularly in long-term use for HIV treatment. Therefore, based on the corrected reasoning and consensus, Chloroquine is the drug that does not cause myopathy.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "
