Vitamin A\nopb. Vitamin K\nopc. Vitamin E\nopd. Vitamin D\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nVitamin K is the only fat-soluble vitamin identified to function as a coenzyme, specifically in the carboxylation of certain proteins required for blood clotting. Vitamin A is primarily involved in vision and immune function but does not act as a coenzyme. Vitamin E serves mainly as an antioxidant and is not known to function as a coenzyme. Vitamin D regulates calcium and phosphate metabolism but also does not function as a coenzyme. Therefore, the correct answer is Vitamin K.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"In the context of fat-soluble vitamins, Vitamin K is well-established as a coenzyme, particularly in the carboxylation of glutamic acid residues in certain proteins that are essential for blood coagulation. This function is critical for the synthesis of clotting factors such as prothrombin. The other fat-soluble vitamins listed—Vitamin A, Vitamin E, and Vitamin D—do not have recognized coenzyme roles. Vitamin A is primarily involved in vision and immune function, Vitamin E acts mainly as an antioxidant, and Vitamin D is crucial for calcium and phosphate metabolism. Therefore, based on established medical knowledge and the enhanced information provided, Vitamin K is the only fat-soluble vitamin that functions as a coenzyme. Thus, the most likely correct answer is Vitamin K.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
