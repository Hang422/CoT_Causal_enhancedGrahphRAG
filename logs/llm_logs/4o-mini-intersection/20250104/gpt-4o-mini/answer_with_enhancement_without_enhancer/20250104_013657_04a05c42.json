Penicillin G\nopb. Tetracycline\nopc. Azithromycin\nopd. Doxycycline\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nThe drug of choice for Treponema pallidum, the causative agent of syphilis, is Penicillin G, which is considered the first-line treatment due to its high efficacy against this bacterium. Tetracycline and Doxycycline are alternative treatments but are less effective than Penicillin G. Azithromycin is not a first-line treatment and is typically reserved for patients with penicillin allergies. Therefore, the most consensus-aligned option is Penicillin G.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The core medical principle regarding the treatment of Treponema pallidum, the bacterium responsible for syphilis, is that Penicillin G is the drug of choice. This is supported by extensive clinical evidence demonstrating its high efficacy and safety profile. While Tetracycline and Doxycycline are viable alternatives, particularly for patients with penicillin allergies, they are not as effective as Penicillin G. Azithromycin is generally not recommended as a first-line treatment for syphilis. Therefore, based on the consensus in the medical community, the best-supported option is Penicillin G.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
