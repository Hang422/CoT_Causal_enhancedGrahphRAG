Cough suppression\nopb. Anti-emesis\nopc. Miosis\nopd. Truncal rigidity\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nOpioids are known to have several pharmacological actions. They are effective in cough suppression, which is a recognized action due to their effect on the cough reflex in the brain. Opioids can also induce nausea, but they are not primarily used for anti-emesis; however, they do have some anti-emetic properties, which can lead to confusion regarding their classification. Miosis, or pupil constriction, is a well-documented effect of opioids due to their action on the central nervous system. Truncal rigidity, while a potential side effect of opioids, is not considered a primary pharmacological action. Therefore, the option that is NOT a pharmacological action of opioids is 'truncal rigidity.'\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Opioids are known for several pharmacological actions, including cough suppression (opa), miosis (opc), and they can have some anti-emetic effects (opb), although they are not primarily used for this purpose. Truncal rigidity (opd) is a side effect associated with high doses of opioids, particularly in the context of anesthesia, but it is not a recognized pharmacological action. Therefore, among the options provided, truncal rigidity is the one that does not represent a primary pharmacological action of opioids.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}",
