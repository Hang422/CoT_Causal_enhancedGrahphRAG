Leucine\nopb. Lysine\nopc. Methionine\nopd. Proline\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nEssential amino acids are those that cannot be synthesized by the body and must be obtained through diet. Leucine, lysine, and methionine are all classified as essential amino acids. In contrast, proline is considered a non-essential amino acid because the body can synthesize it. Therefore, the correct answer to the question is proline, as it is the only non-essential amino acid listed. This conclusion is supported by the consensus in biochemistry regarding amino acid classification.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

Leucine, lysine, and methionine are all classified as essential amino acids. Proline, however, is classified as a non-essential amino acid because the body can synthesize it from other compounds.
