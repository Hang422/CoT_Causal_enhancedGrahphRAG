Drug implicated is?\n\n                    ### Options\n                    opa. Streptomycin\nopb. Isoniazid\nopc. Ethambutol\nopd. Rifampicin\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nStreptomycin is an anti-tubercular drug known for its ototoxicity, which can lead to side effects such as deafness and tinnitus. The reasoning chain for Streptomycin is supported by the consensus that it is the primary drug associated with these auditory side effects. In contrast, Isoniazid is primarily linked to neuropathy and is not typically associated with hearing loss, making it unlikely to be the cause of the symptoms. Ethambutol is known for causing visual disturbances and is not associated with hearing loss, further supporting its exclusion. Rifampicin is primarily associated with hepatotoxicity and does not cause deafness. Therefore, the most likely drug implicated in the patient's symptoms of deafness and tinnitus is Streptomycin.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The core medical principle here is the identification of ototoxic side effects associated with anti-tubercular drugs. Among the options provided, Streptomycin is well-documented to cause ototoxicity, leading to symptoms such as deafness and tinnitus. Isoniazid is primarily associated with peripheral neuropathy, Ethambutol with visual disturbances, and Rifampicin with hepatotoxicity. Given the specific symptoms of deafness and tinnitus in one ear, the consensus strongly supports that Streptomycin is the drug implicated in this case. Therefore, the most likely correct option is Streptomycin.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
