Which of the following enzymes is defective?\n\n                    ### Options\n                    opa. Fructokinase\nopb. Aldolase A\nopc. Aldolase B\nopd. Sucrase\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nThe 6-month-old male baby presents with vomiting, lethargy, and severe jaundice after the introduction of fruit juice, indicating a possible metabolic disorder related to fructose metabolism. The symptoms are consistent with hereditary fructose intolerance, which is caused by a deficiency in Aldolase B. This enzyme is crucial for the metabolism of fructose, and its deficiency leads to the accumulation of fructose-1-phosphate, resulting in severe symptoms upon fructose ingestion, including vomiting and jaundice. Other options, such as Fructokinase and Aldolase A, are less likely to cause such severe symptoms in this context. The evidence supports that Aldolase B is the defective enzyme in this case.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The clinical presentation of the 6-month-old male baby, including vomiting, lethargy, and severe jaundice after the introduction of fruit juice, suggests a metabolic disorder related to fructose metabolism. The symptoms align with hereditary fructose intolerance, which is specifically caused by a deficiency in Aldolase B. This enzyme is essential for the proper metabolism of fructose, and its deficiency leads to the accumulation of fructose-1-phosphate, causing severe symptoms upon fructose ingestion. Other options, such as Fructokinase and Aldolase A, do not typically present with such severe symptoms in infants. Therefore, the most likely defective enzyme in this case is Aldolase B, which is consistent with the enhanced information provided. Based on this reasoning, the best-supported option is Aldolase B.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opc\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
