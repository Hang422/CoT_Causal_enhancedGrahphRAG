Mouth\nopb. Stomach\nopc. Small intestine\nopd. Large intestine\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nDigestion of disaccharides primarily occurs in the small intestine. While salivary amylase in the mouth begins the breakdown of carbohydrates, it does not fully digest disaccharides. In the stomach, no significant digestion of disaccharides occurs due to the acidic environment. The majority of disaccharide digestion is completed in the small intestine, where specific enzymes such as maltase, sucrase, and lactase act to break them down into monosaccharides. This aligns with the consensus that the small intestine is the main site for disaccharide digestion.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "
