Stomach\nopb. Duodenum\nopc. Ileum\nopd. Duodenum + Jejunum\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nIron absorption primarily occurs in the duodenum, which is the first part of the small intestine. While the jejunum also plays a role in nutrient absorption, the majority of iron is absorbed in the duodenum. This is supported by the fact that the duodenal mucosa is specifically involved in iron absorption. Therefore, the most accurate option is 'Duodenum'. The reasoning chains indicating that iron absorption occurs mainly in the duodenum are consistent with established physiological consensus.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Iron absorption primarily occurs in the duodenum, which is the first section of the small intestine. While the jejunum can also absorb some iron, the consensus in physiology is that the duodenum is the primary site for iron uptake due to its specialized mucosa. Therefore, the best-supported option is 'Duodenum'. The option 'Duodenum + Jejunum' suggests that both areas are equally important, which is not consistent with the established understanding that the duodenum is the main site. Thus, the most accurate answer is 'Duodenum'.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
