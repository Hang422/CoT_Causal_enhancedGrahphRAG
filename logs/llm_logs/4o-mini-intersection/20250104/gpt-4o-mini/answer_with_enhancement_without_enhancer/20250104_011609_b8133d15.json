Striated\nopb. Large T tubules\nopc. Troponin system present\nopd. Caldesmon is impoant regulatory protein\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nCardiac muscle is characterized by striated fibers, which are indicative of the presence of sarcomeres, confirming that it is striated (option a). Cardiac muscle also contains large T tubules that facilitate calcium entry, essential for excitation-contraction coupling (option b). The troponin system is indeed present in cardiac muscle, playing a crucial role in muscle contraction (option c). However, caldesmon is primarily associated with smooth muscle and is not a significant regulatory protein in cardiac muscle (option d). Therefore, the correct answer is option d, as it is the only feature not characteristic of cardiac muscle.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Cardiac muscle is characterized by several distinct features. It is striated, indicating the presence of sarcomeres (option a). Cardiac muscle fibers have large T tubules that play a crucial role in calcium handling during contraction (option b). The troponin system, which is essential for muscle contraction, is also present in cardiac muscle (option c). However, caldesmon is primarily a regulatory protein found in smooth muscle, not cardiac muscle. Therefore, the presence of caldesmon is not a feature of cardiac muscle, making option d the correct answer. This conclusion aligns with established knowledge in the field of muscle physiology.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
