Protein C deficiency\nopb. Protein S deficiency\nopc. Hemophillia\nopd. Antithrombin III deficiency\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nWarfarin-induced skin necrosis is primarily associated with deficiencies in Protein C and Protein S. Warfarin inhibits vitamin K-dependent clotting factors, leading to a decrease in Protein C levels, which can precipitate thrombosis and subsequent skin necrosis. Protein C deficiency is particularly noted for causing skin necrosis due to its role in regulating coagulation. Protein S deficiency also contributes to this risk, albeit to a lesser extent. Hemophilia and Antithrombin III deficiency are not typically associated with warfarin-induced skin necrosis, as they do not directly relate to the mechanism of action of warfarin or its effects on vitamin K-dependent proteins. Therefore, the most relevant options are Protein C deficiency and Protein S deficiency.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Warfarin-induced skin necrosis is primarily associated with deficiencies in Protein C and Protein S. When warfarin is initiated, it can lead to a rapid decrease in the levels of these proteins, which are vitamin K-dependent anticoagulants. In individuals with Protein C deficiency, this can result in a pro-coagulative state, leading to thrombosis and subsequent skin necrosis. While Protein S deficiency also increases the risk of skin necrosis, Protein C deficiency is more commonly cited in the literature as a direct cause of this complication. Hemophilia and Antithrombin III deficiency do not have a direct relationship with warfarin-induced skin necrosis, as they involve different mechanisms of coagulation. Therefore, the most likely correct answer is Protein C deficiency, as it is the most strongly associated with this adverse effect of warfarin therapy.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}",
