It is more common with huminsulin\nopb. It may occur in the presence of infections\nopc. It may be due to antibodies to insulin\nopd. Use of glucocorticoids may be useful in severe cases\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nInsulin resistance is a key feature of type 2 diabetes and is often associated with the use of human insulin, making the statement about it being more common with human insulin true. Insulin resistance can indeed occur during infections, which is also a true statement. The idea that insulin resistance may be due to antibodies to insulin is possible but not common, thus making this statement less reliable. Importantly, glucocorticoids are known to worsen insulin resistance rather than being useful in severe cases, contradicting the statement about their utility. Therefore, the statement regarding glucocorticoids is false, aligning with the consensus that they exacerbate insulin resistance rather than alleviate it.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Insulin resistance is a common feature in diabetic patients, particularly in type 2 diabetes. The statements provided can be evaluated as follows: 1) The statement that insulin resistance is more common with human insulin (opa) is true, as human insulin can lead to a higher incidence of insulin resistance compared to other forms of insulin. 2) The statement that insulin resistance may occur in the presence of infections (opb) is also true, as infections can induce a state of insulin resistance due to inflammatory cytokines. 3) The statement that insulin resistance may be due to antibodies to insulin (opc) is less common and not a primary cause of insulin resistance, but it is possible in certain cases. 4) The statement regarding the use of glucocorticoids (opd) is false; glucocorticoids are known to exacerbate insulin resistance rather than provide a therapeutic benefit in severe cases. Therefore, the statement that is not true is the one regarding glucocorticoids. This aligns with the consensus in pharmacology and endocrinology that glucocorticoids worsen insulin resistance. Thus, the best-supported option is opd.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
