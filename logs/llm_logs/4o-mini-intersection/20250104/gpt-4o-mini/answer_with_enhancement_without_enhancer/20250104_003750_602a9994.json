Atrial flutter\nopb. Parkinsonian tremor\nopc. Thyrotoxicosis\nopd. HOCM\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nPropranolol is a non-selective beta-blocker commonly used to manage various conditions. It is effective in treating atrial flutter by controlling heart rate and rhythm. In the case of thyrotoxicosis, propranolol helps alleviate symptoms such as tachycardia, making it a useful treatment option. However, it is not primarily indicated for Parkinsonian tremor, as other treatments are preferred for this condition. Propranolol is also indicated for hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM) as it can reduce left ventricular outflow obstruction. Therefore, the correct answer is that propranolol is not useful for Parkinsonian tremor.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "
