Increased blood pressure caused by nicotine\nopb. Increased skeletal muscle strength caused by neostigmine, an acetycholine esterase inhibitor\nopc. Bradycardia caused by infusion of acetylcholine\nopd. All of these\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nAtropine is a muscarinic receptor antagonist that blocks the effects of acetylcholine at muscarinic receptors. It effectively prevents bradycardia caused by acetylcholine infusion, as it inhibits the parasympathetic effects that lead to decreased heart rate. However, atropine does not affect nicotinic receptors, meaning it cannot block the increased blood pressure caused by nicotine, which acts primarily through nicotinic receptors. Additionally, neostigmine, an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, increases acetylcholine levels, enhancing skeletal muscle strength via nicotinic receptors, which are unaffected by atropine. Therefore, the only effect that can be blocked by atropine is bradycardia caused by acetylcholine. The correct answer is that not all effects are blocked by atropine, specifically only bradycardia is blocked, while the effects of nicotine and neostigmine remain unaffected.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Atropine is a muscarinic receptor antagonist that specifically blocks the effects of acetylcholine at muscarinic receptors. In the context of the options provided: 1) Increased blood pressure caused by nicotine is mediated through nicotinic receptors, which are not affected by atropine. 2) Increased skeletal muscle strength caused by neostigmine also involves nicotinic receptors, and thus, atropine would not block this effect either. 3) Bradycardia caused by infusion of acetylcholine is directly related to muscarinic receptor activation, and atropine effectively blocks this response. Therefore, the only effect that can be blocked by atropine is the bradycardia caused by acetylcholine. The conclusion is that not all effects listed can be blocked by atropine, making 'All of these' an incorrect choice. The best-supported option is that only bradycardia can be blocked by atropine.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opc\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}",
