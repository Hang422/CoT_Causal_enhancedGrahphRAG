Alpha IEN\nopb. Beta IFN\nopc. Gamma IFN\nopd. Natalizumab\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nIn the management of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS), disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) are essential. Beta interferons (Beta IFN) are widely recognized as first-line treatments due to their efficacy in reducing relapse rates and improving long-term outcomes, making them a standard of care in clinical guidelines. Natalizumab is effective for patients with more severe forms of RRMS but is not considered a first-line therapy for all patients, thus it is reserved for cases where other treatments are insufficient. Gamma interferon (Gamma IFN) is not commonly used in RRMS due to limited evidence supporting its efficacy. Therefore, the most appropriate drug of choice for RRMS is Beta IFN, supported by strong clinical consensus.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

Beta interferons (Beta IFN) are well-established as first-line disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) for RRMS, supported by extensive clinical evidence demonstrating their efficacy in reducing relapse rates and improving long-term outcomes. While Natalizumab is effective and may be used in more severe cases or when other treatments fail, it is not considered a first-line option for all patients.
