Lipase\nopb. Pepsinogens\nopc. HCI\nopd. None\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nThe stomach secretes pepsinogens and hydrochloric acid (HCl), which are essential for protein digestion. Pepsinogens are converted to pepsin in the acidic environment created by HCl. In contrast, lipase, which is responsible for fat digestion, is primarily secreted by the pancreas and not by the stomach. Therefore, the correct answer to the question of which is not secreted by the stomach is lipase.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The stomach is known to secrete several important substances for digestion, including pepsinogens and hydrochloric acid (HCl). Pepsinogens are inactive precursors to pepsin, which is activated in the acidic environment created by HCl. However, lipase, which is an enzyme that breaks down fats, is primarily secreted by the pancreas and not by the stomach. Therefore, among the options provided, lipase is the only substance that is not secreted by the stomach. This aligns with established medical knowledge regarding digestive enzyme secretion. Thus, the correct answer is lipase.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
