None of the above\nopb. Albumin\nopc. Globulins\nopd. Chylomicrons\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nFree fatty acids are primarily transported in the bloodstream by binding to albumin, which facilitates their delivery to tissues, including the mitochondria, for oxidation. The reasoning chains confirm that free fatty acids are released from adipose tissue, enter circulation, and bind to albumin for transport. Globulins and chylomicrons do not play a significant role in the transport of free fatty acids for mitochondrial oxidation. Therefore, the correct answer is that free fatty acids are transported by albumin.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Free fatty acids are released from adipose tissue and enter the bloodstream, where they primarily bind to albumin for transport to various tissues, including muscle and liver, for oxidation in the mitochondria. While chylomicrons are involved in the transport of dietary lipids, they are not the primary carriers of free fatty acids in the bloodstream. Globulins do not play a significant role in the transport of free fatty acids either. Therefore, the consensus in the medical literature supports that albumin is the main transport protein for free fatty acids during their journey to the mitochondria for oxidation.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
