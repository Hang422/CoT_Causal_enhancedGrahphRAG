It is highly effective in the treatment of aspergillosis\nopb. It does not penetrate the blood-brain barrier\nopc. Its oral bioavailability is less than that of ketoconazole\nopd. It inhibits demethylation of lanosterol\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nFluconazole is an antifungal medication primarily effective against Candida species, not Aspergillus, making it ineffective for treating aspergillosis. It is known to penetrate the blood-brain barrier, which is important for treating central nervous system fungal infections. Fluconazole has high oral bioavailability, greater than that of ketoconazole. Additionally, it inhibits the enzyme lanosterol demethylase, which is crucial in ergosterol synthesis, confirming its role in inhibiting demethylation of lanosterol. Therefore, the most accurate statement is that fluconazole inhibits demethylation of lanosterol.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Fluconazole is primarily effective against Candida species and is not effective for treating aspergillosis, which makes option opa incorrect. It is known to penetrate the blood-brain barrier, allowing it to treat central nervous system fungal infections, thus making option opb incorrect. Fluconazole has high oral bioavailability, significantly greater than that of ketoconazole, which invalidates option opc. The correct mechanism of action for fluconazole is that it inhibits the enzyme lanosterol demethylase, which is involved in the synthesis of ergosterol, confirming option opd as accurate. Therefore, the most accurate statement about fluconazole is that it inhibits demethylation of lanosterol.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
