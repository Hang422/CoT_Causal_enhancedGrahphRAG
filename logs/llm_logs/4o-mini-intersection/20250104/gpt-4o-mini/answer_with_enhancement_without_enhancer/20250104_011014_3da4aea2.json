Retro bulbar neuritis\nopb. Deafness\nopc. Red urine\nopd. Peripheral neuritis\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nEthambutol is primarily known for its potential to cause retrobulbar neuritis, which is a type of optic neuropathy leading to visual disturbances. This aligns with the consensus that visual side effects are a significant concern with ethambutol use. The reasoning chain indicating retrobulbar neuritis is supported by the evidence of visual alterations as a manifestation of its side effects. Ethambutol is not commonly associated with deafness, as it primarily treats infections that could lead to conditions causing hearing loss, but it does not directly cause deafness itself. The claim regarding red urine is not a common side effect of ethambutol, and while it can occur, it is not a well-documented or significant concern. Peripheral neuritis is a potential side effect, but it is less commonly reported compared to retrobulbar neuritis. Therefore, the most accurate and consensus-supported answer is that ethambutol causes retrobulbar neuritis.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "
