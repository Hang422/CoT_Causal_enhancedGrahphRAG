Hyoscine\nopb. Metoclopramide\nopc. Prochlorperazine\nopd. Ondansetron\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nHyoscine (scopolamine) is an anticholinergic agent that is well-established for the prophylaxis of motion sickness due to its ability to prevent nausea and vomiting associated with vestibular disturbances. Metoclopramide, while a dopamine antagonist that increases gastric motility, is not primarily indicated for motion sickness and is more commonly used for gastrointestinal disorders. Prochlorperazine is an antipsychotic with antiemetic properties but is not considered a first-line treatment for motion sickness. Ondansetron, a serotonin receptor antagonist, is effective for chemotherapy-induced nausea but is not typically used for motion sickness. Therefore, the most appropriate drug for motion sickness prophylaxis is hyoscine.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The core medical principle here is the use of pharmacological agents for the prophylaxis of motion sickness. Hyoscine (scopolamine) is an anticholinergic agent that has been well-studied and is widely recognized for its effectiveness in preventing motion sickness. It works by blocking the action of acetylcholine in the vestibular system, which is involved in balance and spatial orientation. The other options, while they have antiemetic properties, are not primarily indicated for motion sickness: Metoclopramide is used for gastrointestinal issues, Prochlorperazine is an antipsychotic with antiemetic effects but not first-line for motion sickness, and Ondansetron is effective for nausea related to chemotherapy but not for motion sickness. Therefore, based on established medical consensus, the best option for prophylaxis of motion sickness is hyoscine.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
