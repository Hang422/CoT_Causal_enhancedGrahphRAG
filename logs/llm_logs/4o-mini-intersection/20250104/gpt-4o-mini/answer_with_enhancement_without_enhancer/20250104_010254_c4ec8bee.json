Ca transporter\nopb. Cu transporter\nopc. Zn transporter\nopd. Se transporter\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nMenke's Kinky Hair Syndrome is primarily caused by a defect in copper metabolism due to mutations in the ATP7A gene, which encodes a copper transporter. This defect leads to impaired copper transport, resulting in copper deficiency that affects hair structure and pigmentation, as well as causing neurological symptoms. The reasoning chains for options related to copper transport are consistent with this consensus, while options related to calcium, zinc, and selenium transporters are not relevant to the syndrome. Therefore, the correct answer is that Menke's Kinky Hair Syndrome is due to a defect in the Cu transporter.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "
