Strongyloidiasis\nopb. Trichomoniasis\nopc. Schistosomiasis\nopd. Rhinosporidiosis\n\n### Reasoning Chains for Validation:\n- CHAIN: \"Praziquantel\" -> \"antiparasitic medication\" -> \"effective against trematodes\" -> \"commonly used for schistosomiasis\" -> 95%\n- CHAIN: \"Praziquantel\" -> \"antiparasitic medication\" -> \"not effective against nematodes\" -> \"strongyloidiasis is caused by nematodes\" -> 80%\n- CHAIN: \"Praziquantel\" -> \"antiparasitic medication\" -> \"not indicated for trichomoniasis\" -> \"trichomoniasis is a protozoan infection\" -> 85%\n- CHAIN: \"Praziquantel\" -> \"antiparasitic medication\" -> \"not used for rhinosporidiosis\" -> \"rhinosporidiosis is caused by a fungus\" -> 90%\n\n### Retrieved Validation Paths:\n- (Trichomonas Infections)-PREDISPOSES->(Infection)-CAUSES->(Protozoan Infections)\n\n            ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3.

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Praziquantel is an antiparasitic medication primarily effective against trematodes (flatworms) and is most commonly used for the treatment of schistosomiasis, which is caused by these parasites. The other options listed are not treated with praziquantel: strongyloidiasis is caused by nematodes, trichomoniasis is a protozoan infection, and rhinosporidiosis is caused by a fungus. Therefore, the best-supported option based on medical consensus is schistosomiasis.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opc\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
