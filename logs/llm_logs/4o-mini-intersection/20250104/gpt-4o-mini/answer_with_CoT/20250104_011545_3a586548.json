  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Disaccharides, such as sucrose, lactose, and maltose, are carbohydrates that require specific enzymes for their digestion. While some initial breakdown of carbohydrates can occur in the mouth due to salivary amylase, disaccharides are not fully digested there. The stomach does not significantly contribute to the digestion of disaccharides either, as its acidic environment is not conducive to carbohydrate digestion. The primary site for the digestion of disaccharides is the small intestine, where enzymes like maltase, sucrase, and lactase are secreted to break them down into monosaccharides. Therefore, the consensus in the medical community is that the digestion of disaccharides occurs primarily in the small intestine.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opc\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
