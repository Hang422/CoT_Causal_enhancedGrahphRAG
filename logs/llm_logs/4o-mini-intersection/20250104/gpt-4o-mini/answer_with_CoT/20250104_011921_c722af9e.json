All of the following are true about heparin except-\n\n            ### Options\n            opa. Weakest acid found in living things\nopb. Most commercial preparations of heparin now utilize pig intestinal slimes\nopc. Act via Antithrombin activation\nopd. Produce thrombocytopenia\n\n### Reasoning Chains for Validation:\n- CHAIN: \"Heparin is an anticoagulant\" -> \"Inhibits thrombin and factor Xa\" -> \"Acts via Antithrombin activation\" -> \"True statement\" -> 95%\n- CHAIN: \"Heparin is derived from animal sources\" -> \"Most commercial preparations utilize pig intestinal mucosa\" -> \"True statement\" -> 90%\n- CHAIN: \"Heparin can cause a decrease in platelet count\" -> \"This condition is known as thrombocytopenia\" -> \"True statement\" -> 90%\n- CHAIN: \"Heparin is a polysaccharide\" -> \"It is not classified as an acid\" -> \"Weakest acid found in living things is incorrect\" -> 85%\n\n### Retrieved Validation Paths:\n- (Heparin)-CAUSES->(Thrombocytopenia)\n- (Heparin)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Thrombin)\n- (Heparin)-PART_OF->(Cells)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Thrombin)\n- (Heparin)-PART_OF->(Cells)-PART_OF->(Intestinal Mucosa)\n\n            ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n                \n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n            "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Heparin is a well-known anticoagulant that works primarily by activating antithrombin, which inhibits thrombin and factor Xa, making option opc true. Most commercial preparations of heparin are derived from pig intestinal mucosa, confirming option opb as true. Heparin can indeed cause thrombocytopenia, a decrease in platelet count, which validates option opd as true. However, heparin is not classified as an acid; it is a polysaccharide and does not fit the description of being the 'weakest acid found in living things.' Therefore, option opa is the incorrect statement. This reasoning leads to a high confidence in the conclusion.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
