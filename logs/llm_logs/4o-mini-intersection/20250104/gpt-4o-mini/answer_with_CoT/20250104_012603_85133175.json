Bromocriptine\nopb. Levodopa\nopc. Amantadine\nopd. Metoclopramide\n\n### Reasoning Chains for Validation:\n- CHAIN: \"Bromocriptine\" -> \"dopamine agonist\" -> \"decreased prolactin secretion\" -> \"not a cause of hyperprolactinemia\" -> 95%\n- CHAIN: \"Levodopa\" -> \"dopamine precursor\" -> \"increased dopamine levels\" -> \"possible decrease in prolactin\" -> 80%\n- CHAIN: \"Amantadine\" -> \"antiviral and dopaminergic effects\" -> \"possible increase in dopamine\" -> \"unclear effect on prolactin\" -> 70%\n- CHAIN: \"Metoclopramide\" -> \"dopamine antagonist\" -> \"increased prolactin secretion\" -> \"causes hyperprolactinemia\" -> 90%\n\n### Retrieved Validation Paths:\n- (Metoclopramide)-TREATS->(Functional disorder)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(physiological aspects)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Dopamine Antagonists)\n- (Metoclopramide)-TREATS->(Epilepsy)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(physiological aspects)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Dopamine Antagonists)\n- (Bromocriptine)-ISA->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Dopamine)\n- (Dopamine)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Prolactin)\n- (Dopamine)-PART_OF->(Cells)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Prolactin)\n- (Dopamine Hydrochloride)-TREATS->(Migraine Disorders)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Vasodilation)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Dopamine)\n\n            ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3.

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Hyperprolactinemia is primarily caused by increased levels of prolactin, which can occur due to various factors, including certain medications. Among the options provided, Metoclopramide is a dopamine antagonist that inhibits dopamine's action, leading to increased prolactin secretion and thus causing hyperprolactinemia. In contrast, Bromocriptine is a dopamine agonist that decreases prolactin levels, Levodopa increases dopamine levels which may decrease prolactin, and Amantadine has unclear effects on prolactin. Therefore, the most likely correct answer is Metoclopramide, as it is well-documented to cause hyperprolactinemia due to its mechanism of action. The reasoning is supported by pharmacological principles and clinical evidence.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}",
