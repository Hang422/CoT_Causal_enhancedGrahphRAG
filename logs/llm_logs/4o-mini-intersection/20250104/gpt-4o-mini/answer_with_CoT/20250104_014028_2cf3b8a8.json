Naltrexone\nopb. Acamprosate\nopc. Flumazenil\nopd.

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"To determine which of the listed options is not used to treat alcohol dependence, we analyze each one: Naltrexone is known to reduce cravings for alcohol and is commonly used in treatment. Acamprosate helps maintain abstinence and is also a standard treatment for alcohol dependence. Disulfiram works by causing unpleasant reactions when alcohol is consumed, thus deterring drinking. In contrast, Flumazenil is primarily used to reverse the effects of benzodiazepines and is not indicated for the treatment of alcohol dependence. Therefore, Flumazenil is the correct answer as it does not have a role in treating alcohol dependence.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opc\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
