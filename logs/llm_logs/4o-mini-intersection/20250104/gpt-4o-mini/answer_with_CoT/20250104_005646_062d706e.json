  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The primary drug used for the prophylaxis of motion sickness is Hyoscine (also known as Scopolamine), which has anticholinergic properties that effectively prevent nausea and vomiting associated with motion. Metoclopramide, while an antiemetic, primarily increases gastric motility and is not specifically indicated for motion sickness. Prochlorperazine is an antipsychotic with antiemetic effects but is not the first-line treatment for motion sickness. Ondansetron is effective for nausea related to chemotherapy but is not typically used for motion sickness. Therefore, based on the established medical consensus, Hyoscine is the most appropriate choice for motion sickness prophylaxis.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
