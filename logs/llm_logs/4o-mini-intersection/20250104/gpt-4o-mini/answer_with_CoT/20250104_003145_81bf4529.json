  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The patient's symptoms of diminished vision during the night, dryness of eyes, and recurrent bacterial infections strongly suggest a deficiency in Vitamin A. Night blindness is a classic symptom of Vitamin A deficiency, which is also associated with xerophthalmia (dryness of the eyes). The presence of white triangular plaques on the conjunctiva, known as Bitot's spots, further supports this diagnosis, as they are indicative of Vitamin A deficiency. Additionally, Vitamin A plays a crucial role in maintaining immune function, and its deficiency can lead to increased susceptibility to infections. Therefore, the combination of these symptoms and findings points to Vitamin A deficiency as the most likely cause. The other vitamins listed (D, B, and C) do not typically present with these specific ocular symptoms. Thus, the best-supported option is Vitamin A deficiency.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opc\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
