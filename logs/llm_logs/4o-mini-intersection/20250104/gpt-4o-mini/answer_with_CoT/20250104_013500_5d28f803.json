Chlorpropamide\nopb. Glibenclamide\nopc. Glicazide\nopd. Glipizide\n\n### Reasoning Chains for Validation:\n- CHAIN: \"Chlorpropamide\" -> \"stimulates insulin release\" -> \"lowers blood glucose\" -> \"also has antidiuretic effects\" -> \"used in diabetes insipidus\" -> 85%\n- CHAIN: \"Glibenclamide\" -> \"stimulates insulin secretion\" -> \"lowers blood glucose\" -> \"no known effect on diabetes insipidus\" -> \"not used for diabetes insipidus\" -> 70%\n- CHAIN: \"Glicazide\" -> \"stimulates insulin release\" -> \"lowers blood glucose\" -> \"no known effect on diabetes insipidus\" -> \"not used for diabetes insipidus\" -> 70%\n- CHAIN: \"Glipizide\" -> \"stimulates insulin secretion\" -> \"lowers blood glucose\" -> \"no known effect on diabetes insipidus\" -> \"not used for diabetes insipidus\" -> 70%\n\n### Retrieved Validation Paths:\n- (Chlorpropamide)-TREATS->(Disease)-CAUSES/MANIFESTATION_OF->(Tachycardia)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Insulin)\n\n            ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n                \n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n            "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Chlorpropamide is a sulfonylurea that primarily stimulates insulin release from the pancreas, effectively lowering blood glucose levels in patients with diabetes mellitus. Notably, it also has an antidiuretic effect, which makes it useful in treating diabetes insipidus, a condition characterized by excessive thirst and urination due to a deficiency of the antidiuretic hormone (ADH). The other options (Glibenclamide, Glicazide, and Glipizide) are also sulfonylureas that primarily focus on lowering blood glucose levels but do not have the same antidiuretic properties as Chlorpropamide. Therefore, based on the known pharmacological effects, Chlorpropamide is the only drug among the options that is used to treat both diabetes mellitus and diabetes insipidus.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
