  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Menke's Kinky Hair Syndrome is primarily characterized by a defect in copper metabolism due to mutations in the ATP7A gene, which encodes a copper transporter. This defect leads to impaired copper transport, resulting in copper deficiency that affects hair structure, pigmentation, and neurological function. The other options (Ca, Zn, Se transporters) are not directly related to the pathophysiology of Menke's Kinky Hair Syndrome. Therefore, the most supported and correct answer is that the syndrome is due to a defect in the Cu transporter.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
