It follows zero order kinetics\nopb. Not an hepatic enzyme inducer\nopc. It is excreted unchanged in urine\nopd. It is not teratogenic\n\n### Reasoning Chains for Validation:\n- CHAIN: \"Phenytoin is a medication used for seizures\" -> \"It is known to exhibit nonlinear pharmacokinetics\" -> \"This indicates it follows zero order kinetics at therapeutic levels\" -> 95%\n- CHAIN: \"Phenytoin is metabolized by the liver\" -> \"It induces hepatic enzymes\" -> \"This means it is an hepatic enzyme inducer\" -> 90%\n- CHAIN: \"Phenytoin is primarily metabolized in the liver\" -> \"Only a small fraction is excreted unchanged in urine\" -> \"Thus, it is not excreted unchanged in urine\" -> 85%\n- CHAIN: \"Phenytoin is known to have teratogenic effects\" -> \"It can cause fetal hydantoin syndrome\" -> \"Therefore, it is considered teratogenic\" -> 90%\n\n### Retrieved Validation Paths:\n- (Phenytoin)-CAUSES->(Disease)-CAUSES->(Fetal hydantoin syndrome)\n- (Phenytoin)-CAUSES->(Disease)-CAUSES->(Hypertension, Portal)-CAUSES->(Measurement of liver enzyme)\n- (Phenytoin)-TREATS->(Obesity)-CAUSES->(Hypertension, Portal)-CAUSES->(Measurement of liver enzyme)\n- (Phenytoin)-TREATS->(Hypertensive disease)-CAUSES->(Hypertension, Portal)-CAUSES->(Measurement of liver enzyme)\n\n            ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n                \n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n            "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Phenytoin is an antiepileptic drug that is known to exhibit zero-order kinetics at therapeutic levels, meaning that its metabolism is saturable and can lead to increased plasma concentrations with small increases in dose. This supports option 'opa'. Additionally, phenytoin is a hepatic enzyme inducer, which contradicts option 'opb'. It is primarily metabolized in the liver, and only a small fraction is excreted unchanged in urine, which makes option 'opc' incorrect. Furthermore, phenytoin is known to be teratogenic, as it can cause fetal hydantoin syndrome, thus making option 'opd' false. Therefore, the only true statement is that phenytoin follows zero-order kinetics.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
