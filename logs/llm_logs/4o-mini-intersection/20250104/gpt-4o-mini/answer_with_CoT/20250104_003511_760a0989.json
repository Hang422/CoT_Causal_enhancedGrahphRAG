Aldosterone\nopb. DOCA\nopc. Fludrocoeisone\nopd. Triamcinolone\n\n### Reasoning Chains for Validation:\n- CHAIN: \"Mineralocorticoids\" -> \"regulate sodium and potassium balance\" -> \"aldosterone is a primary mineralocorticoid\" -> \"aldosterone is the most potent mineralocorticoid\" -> 95%\n- CHAIN: \"DOCA (Deoxycorticosterone Acetate)\" -> \"is a mineralocorticoid\" -> \"less potent than aldosterone\" -> \"aldosterone is more commonly recognized as the most potent\" -> 85%\n- CHAIN: \"Fludrocortisone\" -> \"is a synthetic mineralocorticoid\" -> \"more potent than cortisol\" -> \"but not as potent as aldosterone\" -> 80%\n- CHAIN: \"Triamcinolone\" -> \"is a glucocorticoid\" -> \"not classified as a mineralocorticoid\" -> \"does not have mineralocorticoid potency\" -> 70%\n\n### Retrieved Validation Paths:\n- (Aldosterone)-INTERACTS_WITH/ISA->(Mineralocorticoids)\n- (Mineralocorticoids)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Aldosterone)\n- (Desoxycorticosterone acetate)-INTERACTS_WITH/ISA->(Mineralocorticoids)\n\n            ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3.

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Mineralocorticoids are hormones that primarily regulate sodium and potassium balance in the body. Aldosterone is recognized as the primary and most potent mineralocorticoid, playing a crucial role in fluid and electrolyte homeostasis. While DOCA (Deoxycorticosterone Acetate) and Fludrocortisone are also mineralocorticoids, they are considered less potent than aldosterone. Triamcinolone, on the other hand, is a glucocorticoid and does not possess mineralocorticoid activity. Therefore, based on established pharmacological knowledge, aldosterone is the most potent mineralocorticoid.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
