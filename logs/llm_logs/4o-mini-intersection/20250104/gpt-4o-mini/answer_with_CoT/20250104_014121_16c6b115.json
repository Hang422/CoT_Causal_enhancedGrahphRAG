  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Tocilizumab is a monoclonal antibody that specifically targets the Interleukin-6 receptor (IL-6R). Interleukin-6 is a pro-inflammatory cytokine that plays a significant role in the pathophysiology of rheumatoid arthritis, contributing to inflammation and joint damage. By binding to the IL-6 receptor, tocilizumab inhibits the signaling pathway of IL-6, thereby reducing inflammation and alleviating symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis. The other options, Interleukin-5 and its receptor, are not directly involved in the mechanism of action of tocilizumab in the context of rheumatoid arthritis. Therefore, the most accurate answer is that tocilizumab targets the Interleukin-6 receptor.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
