  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Myoclonus in children is often associated with various forms of epilepsy, and the treatment typically involves anticonvulsants. Among the options provided, Clonazepam is known to be effective for myoclonic seizures, as it helps reduce myoclonic jerks. Sodium Valproate is also used for various seizure types, including myoclonic seizures, but it is not as specifically targeted as Clonazepam. Phenobarbital is less effective for myoclonic seizures and is not considered a first-line treatment. Ethosuximide primarily treats absence seizures and is not effective for myoclonus. Therefore, Clonazepam is the best-supported option for treating myoclonus in children based on its efficacy in managing myoclonic seizures. The reasoning leads to a high confidence in this choice.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
