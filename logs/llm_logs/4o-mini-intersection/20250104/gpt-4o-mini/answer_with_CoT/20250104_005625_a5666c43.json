  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Aldosterone is a steroid hormone produced by the adrenal cortex that plays a crucial role in regulating sodium and potassium levels in the body. It primarily acts on the renal tubules, specifically enhancing sodium reabsorption and potassium excretion. The most significant sites of action for aldosterone are the distal tubules and the collecting duct of the nephron. While it does have some effects on the proximal tubule, its primary and most impactful actions occur in the distal tubules and collecting duct. Therefore, based on the consensus in pharmacology and renal physiology, the best-supported option is the distal tubules and collecting duct.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
