  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Free fatty acids are primarily transported in the bloodstream bound to albumin. This is a well-established principle in biochemistry, as albumin serves as a major carrier protein for non-esterified fatty acids, facilitating their delivery to tissues, including the mitochondria, for oxidation. Other options such as globulins and chylomicrons do not play a significant role in the transport of free fatty acids for oxidation. Therefore, the most supported and correct answer is that free fatty acids are transported by albumin.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
