  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Lipids absorbed in the intestine are primarily transported to the liver by chylomicrons. Chylomicrons are lipoprotein particles formed in the intestinal mucosa after the digestion of dietary fats. They enter the lymphatic system and subsequently the bloodstream, where they deliver dietary lipids to various tissues, including the liver. Other lipoproteins like VLDL, HDL, and LDL are involved in lipid transport but are not responsible for the initial transfer of lipids from the intestine to the liver. Therefore, the consensus in medical literature supports that chylomicrons are the correct answer for this specific transport process.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
