You would be concerned about the use of this drug if the patient also had what comorbid condition\n\n            ### Options\n            opa. Glaucoma\nopb. Essential tremor\nopc. Diabetes\nopd. Supraventricular tachycardia\n\n### Reasoning Chains for Validation:\n- CHAIN: \"Propranolol prescribed\" -> \"beta-blocker medication\" -> \"can cause bronchoconstriction\" -> \"concern in patients with asthma\" -> \"possible exacerbation of respiratory issues\" -> 85%\n- CHAIN: \"Propranolol prescribed\" -> \"beta-blocker medication\" -> \"can mask hypoglycemia symptoms\" -> \"concern in patients with diabetes\" -> \"risk of unrecognized low blood sugar\" -> 80%\n- CHAIN: \"Propranolol prescribed\" -> \"beta-blocker medication\" -> \"can lower heart rate\" -> \"concern in patients with supraventricular tachycardia\" -> \"may worsen bradycardia\" -> 75%\n- CHAIN: \"Propranolol prescribed\" -> \"beta-blocker medication\" -> \"not contraindicated in glaucoma\" -> \"can be used cautiously\" -> \"less concern compared to other conditions\" -> 90%\n\n### Retrieved Validation Paths:\n- (Diabetes)-CAUSES->(hypoglycemia)\n\n            ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n                \n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n            "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Propranolol is a non-selective beta-blocker that can have several effects on the body, particularly in patients with comorbid conditions. In patients with diabetes, propranolol can mask the symptoms of hypoglycemia, which is a significant concern as it may lead to unrecognized low blood sugar levels. This can be particularly dangerous for diabetic patients who rely on these symptoms to manage their condition. In contrast, while propranolol can affect heart rate and may not be ideal for patients with supraventricular tachycardia, it is not contraindicated and can be used with caution. Glaucoma is not a major concern with propranolol, as it can be used cautiously in these patients. Essential tremor is often treated with propranolol, making it less of a concern. Therefore, the most significant concern regarding the use of propranolol in this scenario is in patients with diabetes due to the risk of masking hypoglycemia symptoms.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opc\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
