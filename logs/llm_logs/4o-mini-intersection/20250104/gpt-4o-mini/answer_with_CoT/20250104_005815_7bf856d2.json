Loxatidine\nopb. Pirenzepine\nopc. Omeprazole\nopd. Famotidine\n\n### Reasoning Chains for Validation:\n- CHAIN: \"Loxatidine\" -> \"blocks H2 receptors\" -> \"reduces gastric acid secretion\" -> \"does not affect cholinergic, histaminergic, or gastrin receptors\" -> 70%\n- CHAIN: \"Pirenzepine\" -> \"blocks M1 muscarinic receptors\" -> \"reduces gastric acid secretion\" -> \"does not block H2 receptors\" -> \"does not meet criteria\" -> 60%\n- CHAIN: \"Omeprazole\" -> \"inhibits proton pump\" -> \"blocks stimulated gastric acid secretion\" -> \"does not affect cholinergic, histaminergic, or gastrin receptors\" -> 90%\n- CHAIN: \"Famotidine\" -> \"blocks H2 receptors\" -> \"reduces gastric acid secretion\" -> \"does not affect cholinergic, histaminergic, or gastrin receptors\" -> 80%\n\n### Retrieved Validation Paths:\n- (Pirenzepine)-TREATS->(Disease)-CAUSES/PREDISPOSES->(Obstruction)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Receptor, Muscarinic M1)\n- (Obstruction)-CAUSES/PREDISPOSES->(Disease)-COMPLICATES->(Insulin Resistance)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Cholecystokinin B Receptor)\n- (Famotidine)-TREATS->(Disease)-MANIFESTATION_OF/PREDISPOSES->(Pathogenesis)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Histamine H2 Receptors)\n- (Omeprazole)-TREATS->(Disease)-CAUSES/MANIFESTATION_OF->(Metabolic acidosis)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Proton Pump)\n\n            ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n                \n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n            "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"To determine which drug blocks both basal and stimulated gastric acid secretion without affecting cholinergic, histaminergic, or gastrin receptors, we analyze each option. Loxatidine is an H2 receptor antagonist, which reduces gastric acid secretion but does not meet the criteria as it still affects H2 receptors. Pirenzepine blocks M1 muscarinic receptors, which does not align with the requirement since it affects cholinergic receptors. Omeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor that effectively blocks both basal and stimulated gastric acid secretion without affecting the specified receptors, making it a strong candidate. Famotidine, like Loxatidine, is also an H2 receptor antagonist and does not meet the criteria. Therefore, Omeprazole is the best-supported option as it meets all the criteria outlined in the question.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opc\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}",
