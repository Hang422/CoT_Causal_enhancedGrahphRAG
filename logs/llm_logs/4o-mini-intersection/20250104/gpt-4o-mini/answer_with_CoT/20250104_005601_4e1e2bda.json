  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Sertoli cells are crucial for spermatogenesis and play a significant role in the male reproductive system. They secrete androgen-binding protein (ABP), which binds testosterone and helps maintain high local concentrations of this hormone, essential for the maturation of sperm. While Sertoli cells are influenced by FSH and indirectly affect testosterone production through their interaction with Leydig cells (which produce testosterone), they do not secrete testosterone, LH, or FSH themselves. Therefore, the most accurate answer regarding what Sertoli cells secrete is androgen-binding protein. The reasoning chains support this conclusion, with a strong emphasis on the role of ABP in spermatogenesis and testosterone binding. Thus, the best-supported option is 'opa' (Androgen binding protein).\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
