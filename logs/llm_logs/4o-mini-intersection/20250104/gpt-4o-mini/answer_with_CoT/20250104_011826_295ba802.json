Vitamin A\nopb. Vitamin C\nopc. Vitamin D\nopd. Vitamin B12\n\n### Reasoning Chains for Validation:\n- CHAIN: \"Vitamin D\" -> \"enhanced insulin sensitivity\" -> \"reduced risk of insulin resistance\" -> \"lower incidence of obesity\" -> \"decreased metabolic syndrome risk\" -> 85%\n- CHAIN: \"Vitamin C\" -> \"antioxidant properties\" -> \"possible reduction in inflammation\" -> \"unclear impact on insulin resistance\" -> 60%\n- CHAIN: \"Vitamin A\" -> \"role in immune function\" -> \"no direct evidence for insulin resistance\" -> \"unclear impact on obesity\" -> 50%\n- CHAIN: \"Vitamin B12\" -> \"essential for energy metabolism\" -> \"no direct evidence for insulin resistance\" -> \"unclear impact on metabolic syndrome\" -> 55%\n\n### Retrieved Validation Paths:\n- (Vitamin D2)-TREATS->(Obesity)-CAUSES->(insulin sensitivity)\n- (Vitamin D2)-PREDISPOSES->(Disease)-CAUSES->(insulin sensitivity)\n- (Vitamin D2)-CAUSES->(Hypertensive disease)-PREDISPOSES->(insulin sensitivity)\n- (Vitamin B 12)-TREATS->(Obesity)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Energy Metabolism)\n- (Vitamin B 12)-TREATS->(Autoimmune Diseases)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Energy Metabolism)\n- (Vitamin B 12)-TREATS->(Heart failure)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Energy Metabolism)\n- (Insulin Resistance)-CAUSES->(Obesity)\n\n            ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n                \n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n            "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Vitamin D has been shown to enhance insulin sensitivity and is associated with a reduced risk of insulin resistance, obesity, and metabolic syndrome. The other vitamins listed (A, C, and B12) do not have strong evidence supporting a direct role in reducing these risks. Vitamin C has antioxidant properties but its impact on insulin resistance is unclear. Vitamin A is important for immune function but lacks direct evidence related to insulin resistance. Vitamin B12 is essential for energy metabolism but does not have a clear link to insulin sensitivity or metabolic syndrome. Therefore, based on the strongest evidence, Vitamin D is the most likely correct answer.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opc\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
