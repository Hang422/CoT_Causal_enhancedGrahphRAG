Monotherapy for acute episodes\nopb. Monitoring of serum concentration is not useful for guiding dose adjustment\nopc. Can result in leucocytosis\nopd. Can result in hypehyroidism on long term use\n\n### Reasoning Chains for Validation:\n- CHAIN: \"Lithium is used in bipolar disorder\" -> \"Effective for acute manic episodes\" -> \"Can be used as monotherapy\" -> 85%\n- CHAIN: \"Monitoring serum concentration is standard practice\" -> \"Guides dose adjustment\" -> \"Important for efficacy and safety\" -> 90%\n- CHAIN: \"Lithium can affect blood cell counts\" -> \"Leucocytosis is a possible side effect\" -> \"Not commonly reported\" -> 70%\n- CHAIN: \"Long-term use of Lithium can affect thyroid function\" -> \"Hypothyroidism is a known risk\" -> \"Hyperthyroidism is less common\" -> 75%\n\n### Retrieved Validation Paths:\n- (Lithium)-PREDISPOSES->(Hypothyroidism)\n- (Lithium)-CAUSES->(Adverse effects)\n- (thyroid function)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Thyrotropin)-TREATS->(Hypothyroidism)\n\n            ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3.

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Lithium is a well-established treatment for bipolar disorder, particularly effective for acute manic episodes, and can be used as monotherapy. Monitoring serum lithium levels is crucial for ensuring therapeutic efficacy and avoiding toxicity, making option opb incorrect. While lithium can cause various hematological changes, leucocytosis is not a common or well-documented side effect, which makes option opc less likely. Long-term use of lithium is more commonly associated with hypothyroidism rather than hyperthyroidism, which suggests that option opd is also incorrect. Therefore, the most accurate statement is that lithium can be used as monotherapy for acute episodes, making option opa the best choice.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
