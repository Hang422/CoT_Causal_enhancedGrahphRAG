  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Isoniazid (INH) is known to induce peripheral neuropathy primarily due to its interference with vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) metabolism. Pyridoxine is essential for the synthesis of neurotransmitters and the maintenance of nerve function. When INH is administered, it can lead to a deficiency in vitamin B6, which in turn can cause neuropathy symptoms. Therefore, the treatment for INH-induced neuropathy is to supplement with pyridoxine to correct this deficiency and alleviate the symptoms. The other options (thiamine, niacin, riboflavin) are not directly indicated for treating INH-induced neuropathy. Based on this understanding, the most appropriate treatment is pyridoxine (option opb).\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
