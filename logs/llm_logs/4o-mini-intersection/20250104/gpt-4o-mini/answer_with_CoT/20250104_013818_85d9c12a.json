Increases liver glycogenolysis\nopb. Causes broachiolar constriction\nopc. Evokes extrasystoles in the heart\nopd. Produces restlessness and anxiety\n\n### Reasoning Chains for Validation:\n- CHAIN: \"Epinephrine administered intravenously\" -> \"stimulates beta-adrenergic receptors\" -> \"increases heart rate and contractility\" -> \"evokes extrasystoles in the heart\" -> 90%\n- CHAIN: \"Epinephrine administered intravenously\" -> \"stimulates alpha-adrenergic receptors\" -> \"increases liver glycogenolysis\" -> 90%\n- CHAIN: \"Epinephrine administered intravenously\" -> \"stimulates beta-2 adrenergic receptors\" -> \"causes bronchodilation\" -> \"possible confusion with bronchiolar constriction\" -> 70%\n- CHAIN: \"Epinephrine administered intravenously\" -> \"activates the central nervous system\" -> \"produces restlessness and anxiety\" -> 90%\n- CHAIN: \"Epinephrine administered intravenously\" -> \"causes vasoconstriction\" -> \"increases blood pressure\" -> \"not related to bronchiolar constriction\" -> 85%\n\n### Retrieved Validation Paths:\n- (Epinephrine)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cells)-INTERACTS_WITH->(beta-adrenergic receptor)\n- (Epinephrine)-CAUSES->(Tachycardia)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(beta-adrenergic receptor)\n- (Epinephrine)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cells)-INTERACTS_WITH->(alpha-adrenergic receptor)\n\n            ### Task:\n                1.

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Epinephrine, when administered intravenously, primarily stimulates both alpha and beta-adrenergic receptors. It increases liver glycogenolysis (option opa) through beta-adrenergic stimulation, and it can evoke extrasystoles in the heart (option opc) due to its effects on heart rate and contractility. It also produces restlessness and anxiety (option opd) as a result of its central nervous system stimulation. However, option opb states that it causes bronchiolar constriction, which is incorrect; epinephrine actually causes bronchodilation through beta-2 adrenergic receptor activation. Therefore, the action that is not associated with high-dose epinephrine is bronchiolar constriction.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
