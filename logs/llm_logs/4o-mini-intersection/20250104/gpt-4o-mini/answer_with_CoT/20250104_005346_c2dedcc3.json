This hormone is:\n\n            ### Options\n            opa. Endothelial growth factor (EGF)\nopb. Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG)\nopc. Human chorionic somatotropin (HCS)\nopd. Relaxin\n\n### Reasoning Chains for Validation:\n- CHAIN: \"Placenta secretes hormones\" -> \"hCG is one of the hormones secreted\" -> \"hCG is detected in urine tests\" -> \"hCG indicates early pregnancy\" -> 95%\n- CHAIN: \"Placenta produces various hormones\" -> \"hCG is specifically produced during pregnancy\" -> \"hCG levels rise in early pregnancy\" -> \"hCG is used for pregnancy tests\" -> 90%\n- CHAIN: \"Hormones secreted by the placenta\" -> \"hCG is a key hormone for pregnancy detection\" -> \"hCG is detected by pregnancy tests\" -> \"positive test indicates pregnancy\" -> 92%\n- CHAIN: \"Pregnancy involves hormonal changes\" -> \"hCG is secreted by the placenta\" -> \"hCG is used in early pregnancy detection\" -> \"hCG presence confirms pregnancy\" -> 93%\n\n### Retrieved Validation Paths:\n- (Hormones)-PART_OF->(Cells)-INTERACTS_WITH/LOCATION_OF->(Human Chorionic Gonadotropin)\n- (Human Chorionic Gonadotropin)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cells)-PART_OF->(Endometrium)-LOCATION_OF->(Pregnancy Tests)\n- (Human Chorionic Gonadotropin)-PART_OF->(Cells)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Melanophores)-LOCATION_OF->(Pregnancy Tests)\n- (Human Chorionic Gonadotropin)-CAUSES->(Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome)-COMPLICATES->(early pregnancy)\n- (Human Chorionic Gonadotropin)-TREATS->(Disease)-CAUSES->(early pregnancy)\n- (Human Chorionic Gonadotropin)-TREATS->(Pre-Eclampsia)-Eclampsia)->(early pregnancy)\n- (early pregnancy)-CAUSES/COMPLICATES->(Fetal Growth Retardation)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Human Chorionic Gonadotropin)\n- (Human Chorionic Gonadotropin)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cells)-PART_OF->(Renal Tissue)-LOCATION_OF->(Urinalysis)\n\n            ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2.

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The placenta is known to secrete several hormones during pregnancy, but the one specifically utilized for early detection of pregnancy is human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). This hormone is produced shortly after the embryo implants in the uterine lining and is detectable in urine and blood tests. The presence of hCG is the basis for most home pregnancy tests, which confirm pregnancy. Other hormones listed, such as endothelial growth factor (EGF), human chorionic somatotropin (HCS), and relaxin, do not serve this specific purpose in early pregnancy detection. Therefore, based on the consensus in medical literature, the most accurate answer is hCG.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
