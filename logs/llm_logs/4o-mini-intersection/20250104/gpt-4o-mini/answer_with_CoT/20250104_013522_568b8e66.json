Diclofenac\nopb. Acetaminophen\nopc. Ibuprofen\nopd. Naproxen\n\n### Reasoning Chains for Validation:\n- CHAIN: Acetaminophen -> \"not classified as an NSAID\" -> \"less gastric irritation\" -> 85%\n- CHAIN: Diclofenac -> \"known to cause gastric irritation\" -> \"higher risk of gastrointestinal side effects\" -> 70%\n- CHAIN: Ibuprofen -> \"can cause gastric irritation\" -> \"moderate risk of gastrointestinal side effects\" -> 75%\n- CHAIN: Naproxen -> \"associated with gastric irritation\" -> \"higher risk of gastrointestinal side effects\" -> 70%\n\n### Retrieved Validation Paths:\n- (Diclofenac)-TREATS->(Disease)-CAUSES->(Nonulcer dyspepsia)\n- (Diclofenac)-PREVENTS->(Symptoms)-CAUSES->(Nonulcer dyspepsia)\n- (Diclofenac)-PREVENTS->(Pain)-CAUSES->(Nonulcer dyspepsia)\n- (Ibuprofen)-TREATS->(Disease)-CAUSES->(Nonulcer dyspepsia)\n- (Ibuprofen)-PREVENTS->(Symptoms)-CAUSES->(Nonulcer dyspepsia)\n- (Ibuprofen)-PREVENTS->(Pain)-CAUSES->(Nonulcer dyspepsia)\n\n            ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3.

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The question asks which NSAID is least likely to cause gastric irritation. Acetaminophen is not classified as an NSAID, and it is known to have a much lower risk of causing gastric irritation compared to traditional NSAIDs. Diclofenac, ibuprofen, and naproxen are all NSAIDs that can cause gastric irritation, with diclofenac and naproxen generally associated with higher risks. Ibuprofen has a moderate risk of gastrointestinal side effects. Therefore, the best-supported option is acetaminophen, as it is not an NSAID and is less likely to cause gastric irritation.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}",
