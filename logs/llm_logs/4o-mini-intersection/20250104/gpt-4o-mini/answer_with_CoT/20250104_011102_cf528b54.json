  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Diabetes insipidus is characterized by a deficiency of antidiuretic hormone (ADH), leading to an inability to concentrate urine. This results in the production of large volumes of dilute urine. Typically, urine osmolality in patients with diabetes insipidus is significantly lower than normal, often falling below 300 mmol/L. The most common range for urine osmolality in diabetes insipidus is <150 mmol/L to <300 mmol/L, but the consensus indicates that it is generally below 300 mmol/L. Therefore, the best-supported option is <300 mmol/L, as it encompasses the majority of cases and aligns with the understanding of the condition. The other options, while they may be true in some cases, do not represent the typical findings in diabetes insipidus as accurately as <300 mmol/L does.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
