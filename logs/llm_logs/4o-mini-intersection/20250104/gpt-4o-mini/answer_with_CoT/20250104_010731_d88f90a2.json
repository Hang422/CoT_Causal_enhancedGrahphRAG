  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) is a common form of multiple sclerosis that requires effective disease-modifying therapies to reduce relapse rates and slow disease progression. The first-line treatments for RRMS include beta interferons (Beta IFN) and glatiramer acetate, which are well-supported by clinical guidelines and have a strong evidence base for their efficacy in reducing relapse rates. Beta IFN is particularly noted for its ability to improve long-term outcomes and is widely accepted as a standard of care. While Natalizumab is effective and used in more severe cases or when other treatments fail, it is not considered the first-line treatment for all patients with RRMS. Gamma IFN is not commonly used for this condition and lacks sufficient evidence to support its use. Therefore, the best-supported option based on current medical consensus is Beta IFN.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
