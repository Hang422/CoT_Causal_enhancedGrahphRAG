  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Nyctalopia, or night blindness, is primarily associated with a deficiency in Vitamin A. This vitamin is crucial for the synthesis of rhodopsin, a pigment found in the retina that is essential for low-light vision. The reasoning chains consistently point to Vitamin A as the key nutrient involved in the condition, with multiple sources confirming that its deficiency leads to impaired vision in dim light. Other vitamins listed (B, C, E) do not have a direct link to nyctalopia. Therefore, the most supported and consensus-based answer is Vitamin A deficiency.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
