Methotrexate\nopb. Doxorubicin\nopc. Cisplatin\nopd. Busulfan\n\n### Reasoning Chains for Validation:\n- CHAIN: \"Methotrexate\" -> \"known to cause pulmonary toxicity\" -> \"can lead to pulmonary fibrosis\" -> 85%\n- CHAIN: \"Doxorubicin\" -> \"associated with various pulmonary complications\" -> \"less commonly linked to pulmonary fibrosis\" -> 70%\n- CHAIN: \"Cisplatin\" -> \"can cause lung toxicity\" -> \"not typically associated with pulmonary fibrosis\" -> 60%\n- CHAIN: \"Busulfan\" -> \"known to cause pulmonary toxicity\" -> \"can lead to pulmonary fibrosis\" -> 80%\n\n### Retrieved Validation Paths:\n- (Complication)-CAUSES->(Pulmonary Fibrosis)\n- (Busulfan)-CAUSES->(Graft acceptance)-PROCESS_OF->(Lung)\n- (Methotrexate)-CAUSES->(Immunity)-PROCESS_OF->(Lung)\n\n            ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3.

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Pulmonary fibrosis is a known complication of certain chemotherapeutic agents. Among the options provided, Methotrexate and Busulfan are both recognized for their potential to cause pulmonary toxicity, which can lead to pulmonary fibrosis. Methotrexate is particularly noted for its association with pulmonary complications, including interstitial lung disease and fibrosis. Busulfan is also known to cause pulmonary toxicity, especially in the context of conditioning regimens for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Doxorubicin and Cisplatin have pulmonary side effects but are less commonly associated with pulmonary fibrosis specifically. Given the stronger association of Methotrexate with pulmonary fibrosis, it is the most likely correct answer. Therefore, the best-supported option is Methotrexate.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
