  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Tamoxifen is a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) commonly used in the treatment of estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer. It is associated with several adverse effects. The known adverse effects include an increased risk of thromboembolism (opa), endometrial carcinoma (opb), and carcinoma in the contralateral breast (opc). While cataracts (opd) can occur, they are not as strongly linked to tamoxifen use compared to the other options. Therefore, among the listed options, cataracts are the least likely to be considered a direct adverse effect of tamoxifen, making it the correct answer to the question.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
