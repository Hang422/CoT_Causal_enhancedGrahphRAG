  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"In cases of suspected congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) in a pregnant female, the primary concern is to prevent virilization of the female fetus. Dexamethasone is a glucocorticoid that effectively reduces androgen production from the adrenal glands, thereby minimizing the risk of virilization. While other corticosteroids like hydrocortisone, betamethasone, and prednisolone have their uses, they are not the first-line treatment for this specific indication. Betamethasone is primarily used for promoting fetal lung maturity and is not indicated for CAH. Hydrocortisone is used for adrenal insufficiency but does not effectively prevent virilization. Prednisolone is less effective than dexamethasone for this purpose. Therefore, based on the consensus in medical literature, dexamethasone is the drug of choice for managing suspected congenital adrenal hyperplasia in a pregnant female.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
