  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Opioids are known for several pharmacological actions. They are effective in cough suppression (opa), as they act on the cough center in the brain. They can also cause miosis (opc), which is the constriction of pupils, a well-documented effect of opioids. Truncal rigidity (opd) is a phenomenon that can occur with high doses of opioids, particularly in the context of anesthesia, but it is not a primary therapeutic action. On the other hand, while opioids can induce nausea, they are not primarily used for anti-emesis (opb); in fact, they are more commonly associated with causing nausea rather than preventing it. Therefore, the option that is NOT a pharmacological action of opioids is anti-emesis (opb).\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}",
