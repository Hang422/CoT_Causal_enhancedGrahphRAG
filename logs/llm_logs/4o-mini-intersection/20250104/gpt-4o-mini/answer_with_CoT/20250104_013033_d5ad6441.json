Methylphenidate is a well-established stimulant that has been shown to effectively improve attention and reduce hyperactivity in individuals with ADHD. Other options listed, such as Haloperidol (an antipsychotic), Imipramine (a tricyclic antidepressant), and Alprazolam (a benzodiazepine), are not first-line treatments for ADHD and are generally not recommended for this condition. Therefore, based on clinical guidelines and consensus in the medical community, Methylphenidate is the drug of choice for ADHD.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
