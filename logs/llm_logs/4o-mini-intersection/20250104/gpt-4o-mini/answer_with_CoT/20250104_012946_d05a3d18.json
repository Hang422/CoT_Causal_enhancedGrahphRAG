  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Testosterone is primarily produced in the Leydig cells, which are located in the interstitial space of the testes. Leydig cells are specifically responsible for synthesizing testosterone in response to luteinizing hormone (LH) stimulation. While Sertoli cells support spermatogenesis and are found in the seminiferous tubules, they do not produce testosterone. The epididymis is involved in sperm maturation but does not produce hormones. Therefore, the consensus in medical literature clearly identifies Leydig cells as the main contributors to testosterone production.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
