Penicillin G\nopb. Tetracycline\nopc. Azithromycin\nopd. Doxycycline\n\n### Reasoning Chains for Validation:\n- CHAIN: \"Treponema Pallidum identified\" -> \"Bacterial infection confirmed\" -> \"Penicillin G is the first-line treatment\" -> \"Effective against Treponema Pallidum\" -> 95%\n- CHAIN: \"Treponema Pallidum identified\" -> \"Bacterial infection confirmed\" -> \"Tetracycline is an alternative treatment\" -> \"Less effective than Penicillin G\" -> 70%\n- CHAIN: \"Treponema Pallidum identified\" -> \"Bacterial infection confirmed\" -> \"Azithromycin is not first-line\" -> \"Used in penicillin-allergic patients\" -> 60%\n- CHAIN: \"Treponema Pallidum identified\" -> \"Bacterial infection confirmed\" -> \"Doxycycline is an alternative treatment\" -> \"Effective but not first-line\" -> 75%\n\n### Retrieved Validation Paths:\n- (Treponema pallidum)-CAUSES->(Bacterial Infections)\n- (First line treatment)-TREATS->(Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome)-PROCESS_OF->(Treponema pallidum)\n- (First line treatment)-TREATS->(Syphilis)-PROCESS_OF->(Treponema pallidum)\n\n            ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2.

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Treponema pallidum is the causative agent of syphilis, and the standard treatment for this infection is Penicillin G. This antibiotic is highly effective against Treponema pallidum and is considered the first-line treatment. While alternatives like Tetracycline, Azithromycin, and Doxycycline can be used, they are not the preferred options. Tetracycline and Doxycycline are effective but are generally reserved for patients who are allergic to penicillin or in specific cases. Azithromycin is also used in penicillin-allergic patients but is not the first-line treatment. Therefore, based on established medical guidelines and consensus, Penicillin G is the drug of choice for treating Treponema pallidum infections.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
