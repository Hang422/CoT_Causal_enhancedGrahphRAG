  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Cholecystokinin (CCK) is a hormone that plays a crucial role in digestion. It is released from the intestinal mucosa in response to fatty acids and amino acids in the small intestine. The actions of CCK include stimulating the contraction of the gallbladder, which releases bile into the intestine to aid in fat digestion (option opa). Additionally, CCK stimulates the secretion of pancreatic juice that is rich in digestive enzymes, enhancing the digestion of nutrients (option opb). While CCK does not directly increase the secretion of enterokinase, it does play a role in the activation of pancreatic enzymes, which are crucial for protein digestion (option opc). Given that CCK has multiple actions, including those listed in options a, b, and c, the most comprehensive answer is 'All' (option opd). Therefore, the best-supported option is 'All' as it encompasses the various actions of CCK. The reasoning chains and validation paths support this conclusion, indicating that CCK has a multifaceted role in digestion.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
