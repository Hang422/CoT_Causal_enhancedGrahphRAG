  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"In evaluating the drugs listed for the treatment of bipolar disorder, we can analyze each option based on their established indications. Carbamazepine is known to be effective for mood stabilization and is indicated for bipolar disorder. Sodium valproate is also recognized for its efficacy in treating bipolar disorder, particularly in acute mania. Lamotrigine is used for maintenance treatment in bipolar disorder, especially for preventing depressive episodes. However, Vigabatrin is primarily used for the treatment of epilepsy and is not indicated for bipolar disorder. Therefore, the most likely correct answer is Vigabatrin, as it does not align with the treatment guidelines for bipolar disorder.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}",
