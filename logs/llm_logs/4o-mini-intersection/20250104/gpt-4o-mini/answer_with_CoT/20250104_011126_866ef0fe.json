It is more common with huminsulin\nopb. It may occur in the presence of infections\nopc. It may be due to antibodies to insulin\nopd. Use of glucocorticoids may be useful in severe cases\n\n### Reasoning Chains for Validation:\n- CHAIN: \"Insulin resistance\" -> \"often associated with type 2 diabetes\" -> \"more common with human insulin\" -> \"true statement\" -> 90%\n- CHAIN: \"Insulin resistance\" -> \"can occur during infections\" -> \"true statement\" -> 90%\n- CHAIN: \"Insulin resistance\" -> \"may be due to antibodies to insulin\" -> \"possible but not common\" -> \"unclear\" -> 70%\n- CHAIN: \"Insulin resistance\" -> \"use of glucocorticoids\" -> \"may worsen insulin resistance\" -> \"not useful in severe cases\" -> 85%\n\n### Retrieved Validation Paths:\n- (Glucocorticoids)-CAUSES->(Insulin Resistance)\n- (Diabetes Mellitus, Non-Insulin-Dependent)-Insulin->(Pathogenesis)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Insulin, Regular, Human)\n- (Insulin Resistance)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Genes)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Glucocorticoids)\n\n            ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n                \n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n            "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"To determine the false statement regarding insulin resistance in diabetic patients, we analyze each option: 1. 'It is more common with huminsulin' - This is true; insulin resistance is often associated with human insulin formulations. 2. 'It may occur in the presence of infections' - This is also true; infections can exacerbate insulin resistance. 3. 'It may be due to antibodies to insulin' - While antibodies to insulin can occur, they are not a common cause of insulin resistance, making this statement less reliable. 4. 'Use of glucocorticoids may be useful in severe cases' - This is false; glucocorticoids typically worsen insulin resistance rather than help it. Therefore, the statement that is not true is related to glucocorticoids. The best-supported option is 'Use of glucocorticoids may be useful in severe cases.'\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}",
