  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The plasma membrane of a cell is indeed anchored to the cytoskeleton through specific proteins. Spectrin is a cytoskeletal protein that forms a mesh-like structure beneath the plasma membrane, providing structural support. Ankyrin is an important anchoring protein that connects Spectrin to integral membrane proteins, facilitating the linkage between the plasma membrane and the cytoskeleton. While Tubulin is a component of microtubules and Laminin is part of the extracellular matrix, they do not directly mediate the connection between the plasma membrane and the cytoskeleton. Therefore, the most relevant proteins in this context are Spectrin and Ankyrin, with Ankyrin serving as the connector. Given the options, the best answer is Ankyrin, as it plays a crucial role in linking Spectrin to the plasma membrane. Thus, the most likely correct option is opb (Ankyrin).\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}",
