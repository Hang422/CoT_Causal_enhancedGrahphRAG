  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The question asks for a topical immunomodulator used for the treatment of genital warts. Among the options provided, Imiquimod is recognized as a topical immunomodulator that enhances the immune response against the human papillomavirus (HPV), which is responsible for genital warts. Podophylline, while a topical treatment for genital warts, is a cytotoxic agent and not an immunomodulator. Acyclovir is an antiviral medication used for herpes simplex virus infections, and interferon is not typically used topically for genital warts. Therefore, based on the definitions and uses of these medications, Imiquimod is the most appropriate choice. The reasoning chains consistently point to Imiquimod as the correct answer, reinforcing its role as a topical immunomodulator specifically indicated for genital warts. Thus, I am confident in selecting Imiquimod as the answer.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
