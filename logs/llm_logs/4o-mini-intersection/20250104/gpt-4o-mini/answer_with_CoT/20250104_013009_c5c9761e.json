Salbutamol\nopb. Ketotifen\nopc. Fluticasone\nopd. Monteleukast\n\n### Reasoning Chains for Validation:\n- CHAIN: \"Salbutamol\" -> \"beta adrenergic agonist\" -> \"bronchodilation\" -> \"used in aerosol form\" -> \"effective for bronchial asthma\" -> 95%\n- CHAIN: \"Ketotifen\" -> \"antihistamine\" -> \"not a beta adrenergic agonist\" -> \"not used for bronchial asthma\" -> 10%\n- CHAIN: \"Fluticasone\" -> \"corticosteroid\" -> \"anti-inflammatory\" -> \"not a beta adrenergic agonist\" -> \"not used as aerosol for bronchial asthma\" -> 15%\n- CHAIN: \"Montelukast\" -> \"leukotriene receptor antagonist\" -> \"not a beta adrenergic agonist\" -> \"not used as aerosol for bronchial asthma\" -> 10%\n\n### Retrieved Validation Paths:\n- (Adrenergic beta-Agonists)-Agonists)->(Asthma)\n- (Albuterol)-INTERACTS_WITH/ISA->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Adrenergic beta-Agonists)-Agonists)\n- (fluticasone)-ISA->(Adrenal Cortex Hormones)\n- (Histamine Antagonists)-ISA->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Adrenergic beta-Agonists)\n- (Histamine Antagonists)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Stimulant)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Adrenergic beta-Agonists)\n- (Leukotriene Antagonists)-ISA->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Adrenergic beta-Agonists)\n- (Leukotriene Antagonists)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Anti-Asthmatic Agents)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Adrenergic beta-Agonists)\n\n            ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3.

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Salbutamol is a well-known beta adrenergic agonist that is commonly used as a bronchodilator in the treatment of bronchial asthma. It is often administered via aerosol inhalation, making it effective for rapid relief of asthma symptoms. The other options provided do not fit the criteria: Ketotifen is an antihistamine, Fluticasone is a corticosteroid, and Montelukast is a leukotriene receptor antagonist. None of these are beta adrenergic agonists or used in aerosol form for asthma treatment. Therefore, Salbutamol is the only correct answer based on established medical knowledge and consensus.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
