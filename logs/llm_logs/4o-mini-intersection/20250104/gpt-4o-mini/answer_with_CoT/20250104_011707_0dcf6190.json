Clindamycin\nopb. Erythromycin\nopc. Ampicillin\nopd.

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Bacterial vaginosis is primarily caused by an imbalance in the normal bacterial flora of the vagina, often involving an overgrowth of anaerobic bacteria. The treatment of choice is aimed at restoring this balance. Metronidazole is well-established as the first-line treatment due to its effectiveness against anaerobic bacteria, which are commonly implicated in bacterial vaginosis. Clindamycin is also effective and can be used as an alternative, but it is not the first-line treatment. Erythromycin and ampicillin are not typically used for this condition and are less effective compared to metronidazole. Therefore, based on clinical guidelines and consensus, metronidazole is the most appropriate choice for treating bacterial vaginosis.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
