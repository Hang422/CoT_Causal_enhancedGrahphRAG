  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Ethambutol is primarily known for its use in treating tuberculosis and is associated with specific side effects. The most notable adverse effect is retrobulbar neuritis, which can lead to visual disturbances. This aligns with the chains of reasoning that highlight the connection between ethambutol and retrobulbar neuritis. While peripheral neuritis is a potential side effect, it is less commonly associated with ethambutol compared to retrobulbar neuritis. Deafness is not a recognized side effect of ethambutol, and while ethambutol can cause changes in urine color, red urine is not a common or well-documented effect. Therefore, the best-supported option based on medical consensus is retrobulbar neuritis.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
