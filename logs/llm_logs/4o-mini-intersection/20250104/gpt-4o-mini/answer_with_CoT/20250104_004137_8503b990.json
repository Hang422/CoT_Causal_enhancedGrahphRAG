  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Fosphenytoin is a prodrug of phenytoin, which means it is converted to phenytoin in the body. Both drugs are used to treat seizures, but they have different properties. Fosphenytoin is more soluble in saline, making it easier to administer intravenously compared to phenytoin, which can precipitate in saline. While both drugs can be used for various types of seizures, phenytoin is not typically the drug of choice for myoclonic seizures, and there is no strong evidence that fosphenytoin is preferred for this indication either. Fosphenytoin can be given orally, similar to phenytoin, but the key distinguishing feature is its solubility in saline. Therefore, the most accurate answer is that fosphenytoin can be mixed with saline, which is a significant difference from phenytoin. The other options either do not represent a difference or are not accurate regarding the use of these medications.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}",
