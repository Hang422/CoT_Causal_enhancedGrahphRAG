  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"To determine which drug is a uricosuric agent, we need to understand the mechanism of action of each option. Probenecid is known to inhibit the renal tubular reabsorption of uric acid, leading to increased excretion of uric acid in the urine, which is the definition of a uricosuric drug. Allopurinol, on the other hand, works by inhibiting xanthine oxidase, thereby reducing uric acid production, and is not classified as a uricosuric agent. Indomethacin is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that does not affect uric acid excretion. Aspirin, particularly at low doses, can actually inhibit uric acid excretion, making it counterproductive as a uricosuric agent. Therefore, the only drug among the options that fits the definition of a uricosuric drug is Probenecid. Based on this reasoning, the best-supported option is Probenecid.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
