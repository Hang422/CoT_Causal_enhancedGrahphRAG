Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3.

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is associated with a significant risk of cerebral vasospasm, which can lead to delayed ischemic neurological deficits. Nimodipine is a calcium channel blocker that has been specifically studied and shown to improve outcomes in patients with SAH by preventing or mitigating vasospasm. Other calcium channel blockers like Amlodipine, Diltiazem, and Verapamil are not indicated for this specific purpose and do not have the same evidence supporting their use in the context of SAH. Therefore, based on the consensus in medical literature, Nimodipine is the drug of choice for managing the complications associated with subarachnoid hemorrhage, particularly vasospasm. The reasoning is supported by multiple studies and clinical guidelines emphasizing the role of Nimodipine in improving cerebral blood flow and reducing the risk of complications following SAH.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
