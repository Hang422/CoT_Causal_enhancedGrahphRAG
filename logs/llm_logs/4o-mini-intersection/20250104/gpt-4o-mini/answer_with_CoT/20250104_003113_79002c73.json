  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The question asks for a drug that does not cause hyperprolactinemia. Bromocriptine is a dopamine agonist, which inhibits prolactin secretion, thus it does not cause hyperprolactinemia. In contrast, Haloperidol and Chlorpromazine are both dopamine antagonists, which increase prolactin levels and can lead to hyperprolactinemia. Reserpine depletes monoamines and may affect dopamine levels, but its exact effect on prolactin is less clear, making it a less certain option. Therefore, the most definitive answer is Bromocriptine, as it is well-established that it does not cause hyperprolactinemia.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
