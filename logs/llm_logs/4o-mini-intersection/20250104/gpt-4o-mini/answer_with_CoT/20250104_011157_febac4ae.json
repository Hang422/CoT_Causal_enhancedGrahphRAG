  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The conversion of androgens to estrogens in the ovarian follicle is primarily facilitated by the enzyme aromatase. Aromatase specifically catalyzes the aromatization of androgens, such as testosterone and androstenedione, into estrogens like estradiol. This process is crucial for the development and function of ovarian follicles. Other enzymes listed, such as 5 alpha reductase, desmolase, and isomerase, do not play a direct role in this conversion. 5 alpha reductase is involved in converting testosterone to dihydrotestosterone, desmolase is involved in the initial steps of steroidogenesis, and isomerase catalyzes structural rearrangements but is not specific to androgen to estrogen conversion. Therefore, the best-supported option is aromatase.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
