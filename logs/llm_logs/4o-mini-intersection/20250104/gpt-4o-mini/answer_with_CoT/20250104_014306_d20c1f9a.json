This hormone is produced in which one of the following anatomical locations?\n\n            ### Options\n            opa. Hypothalamus\nopb. Anterior pituitary\nopc. Posterior pituitary\nopd. Adrenal cortex\n\n### Reasoning Chains for Validation:\n- CHAIN: \"Oxytocin\" -> \"stimulates uterine contractions\" -> \"produced in the posterior pituitary\" -> 95%\n- CHAIN: \"Uterine contractions\" -> \"facilitated by hormones\" -> \"oxytocin is key hormone\" -> \"produced in the posterior pituitary\" -> 90%\n- CHAIN: \"Labor process\" -> \"requires hormonal regulation\" -> \"oxytocin is released\" -> \"from the posterior pituitary\" -> 85%\n- CHAIN: \"Hormones during labor\" -> \"oxytocin is crucial\" -> \"originates from the posterior pituitary\" -> 90%\n\n### Retrieved Validation Paths:\n- (Oxytocin)-CAUSES->(Vasodilation)-PROCESS_OF->(Pituitary Gland, Posterior)\n- (Hormones)-CAUSES->(Disease)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(biological adaptation to stress)-PROCESS_OF->(Pituitary Gland, Posterior)\n- (Oxytocin)-CAUSES->(Energy Metabolism)-PROCESS_OF->(Pituitary Gland, Posterior)\n- (Oxytocin)-CAUSES->(Excretory function)-PROCESS_OF->(Pituitary Gland, Posterior)\n- (Hormones)-CAUSES->(Disease)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(physiological aspects)-PROCESS_OF->(Pituitary Gland, Posterior)\n- (Hormones)-CAUSES->(Disease)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Excretory function)-PROCESS_OF->(Pituitary Gland, Posterior)\n\n            ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n                \n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n            "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The hormone responsible for stimulating uterine contractions during labor is oxytocin. Oxytocin is synthesized in the hypothalamus but is stored and released from the posterior pituitary gland. The consensus in medical literature supports that while the hypothalamus produces oxytocin, its primary action during labor is mediated through its release from the posterior pituitary. Therefore, the most accurate answer regarding the anatomical location of oxytocin's release during labor is the posterior pituitary.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opc\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
