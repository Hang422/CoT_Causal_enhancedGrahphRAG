  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The case presents a 6-month-old male baby with vomiting, lethargy, and severe jaundice after the introduction of fruit juice, which is high in fructose. These symptoms are indicative of a metabolic disorder, specifically related to fructose metabolism. The enzyme primarily responsible for the metabolism of fructose is Aldolase B. A deficiency in Aldolase B leads to hereditary fructose intolerance, which manifests with severe symptoms upon ingestion of fructose-containing foods, such as fruit juice. The other options (Fructokinase, Aldolase A, and Sucrase) are less likely to cause the severe symptoms observed in this case. Therefore, the most likely defective enzyme is Aldolase B, which aligns with the clinical presentation and dietary history. The reasoning is supported by the known pathophysiology of hereditary fructose intolerance, leading to a high confidence in this conclusion.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opc\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}",
