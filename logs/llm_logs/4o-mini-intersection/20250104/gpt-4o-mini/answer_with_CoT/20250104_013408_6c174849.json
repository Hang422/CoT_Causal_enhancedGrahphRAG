Protein linked with glycosidic bond\nopb. Core protein\nopc. Sugar residues are long in carbohydrate poion of glycoprotein\nopd. None\n\n### Reasoning Chains for Validation:\n- CHAIN: \"Glycoprotein\" -> \"contains protein and carbohydrate components\" -> \"protein linked with glycosidic bond\" -> 95%\n- CHAIN: \"Glycoprotein\" -> \"has a core protein\" -> \"sugar residues attached to the core\" -> 90%\n- CHAIN: \"Glycoprotein\" -> \"sugar residues are present\" -> \"carbohydrate portion varies in length\" -> \"some may be long\" -> 85%\n- CHAIN: \"Glycoprotein\" -> \"is a type of biomolecule\" -> \"not all characteristics are universally applicable\" -> \"some may not fit the definition\" -> 70%\n\n### Retrieved Validation Paths:\n- (Glycoproteins)-INTERACTS_WITH/PART_OF->(Cells)-LOCATION_OF->(Proteins)\n\n            ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n                \n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n            "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Glycoproteins are biomolecules that consist of a protein component covalently linked to carbohydrate moieties through glycosidic bonds. The core protein is essential as it serves as the backbone to which the sugar residues are attached. While the carbohydrate portion can vary in length, it is not universally characterized by long sugar residues; thus, this statement is less definitive. The most accurate and universally applicable characteristic of glycoproteins is that they are proteins linked with glycosidic bonds. Therefore, the best-supported option is 'opa', which states that glycoproteins are proteins linked with glycosidic bonds.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
