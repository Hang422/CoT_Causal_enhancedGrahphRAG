  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The cardiac muscle primarily utilizes fatty acids as its main source of energy under normal physiological conditions. Fatty acids are abundant in the bloodstream and are metabolized through beta-oxidation to produce ATP, which is crucial for the high energy demands of the heart. While the heart can also utilize ketone bodies and glucose, especially during periods of fasting or increased demand, fatty acids remain the predominant energy source. The adaptability of cardiac muscle to use different substrates is well-documented, but under normal conditions, fatty acids are favored. Therefore, the best-supported option is that fatty acids are the primary source of energy for cardiac muscle at normal conditions.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}",
