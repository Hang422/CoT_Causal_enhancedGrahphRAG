  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Wernicke's encephalopathy is primarily associated with thiamine deficiency, which is vitamin B1. The condition is characterized by symptoms such as confusion, ataxia, and ophthalmoplegia, which are directly linked to a lack of thiamine. This deficiency is particularly common in individuals with chronic alcoholism due to poor nutritional intake and absorption issues. Other vitamin deficiencies, such as B2, B6, and B12, are not typically associated with Wernicke's encephalopathy. Therefore, the core medical principle here is that thiamine (vitamin B1) is the major vitamin deficiency in this condition. Based on the consensus in medical literature, the most likely correct answer is option 'opa' (B1).\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
