Xylose\nopb. Mannose\nopc. Glucose\nopd. Ribose\n\n### Reasoning Chains for Validation:\n- CHAIN: \"Glucose\" -> \"actively transported in the intestine\" -> \"against concentration gradient\" -> \"most common sugar absorbed\" -> 95%\n- CHAIN: \"Xylose\" -> \"absorbed passively\" -> \"not against concentration gradient\" -> \"less common in diet\" -> 80%\n- CHAIN: \"Mannose\" -> \"absorbed via specific transporters\" -> \"not primarily against concentration gradient\" -> \"less significant in human metabolism\" -> 75%\n- CHAIN: \"Ribose\" -> \"not primarily absorbed in the intestine\" -> \"limited dietary sources\" -> \"not a major sugar\" -> 70%\n\n### Retrieved Validation Paths:\n- (Glucose)-CAUSES->(Intestinal Metabolism)-PROCESS_OF->(Intestines)\n- (Glucose)-CAUSES->(paracrine)-PROCESS_OF->(Intestines)\n- (Glucose)-CAUSES->(Respiration)-PROCESS_OF->(Intestines)\n- (Mannose)-TREATS->(Fibrosis)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Membrane Transport Proteins)\n\n            ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3.

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"In the intestine, glucose is absorbed primarily through active transport mechanisms, specifically via the sodium-glucose co-transporter (SGLT1), which allows glucose to be absorbed against its concentration gradient. This is a well-established physiological process. Other sugars like xylose, mannose, and ribose are absorbed through different mechanisms, primarily passive transport or specific transporters that do not operate against a concentration gradient. Therefore, glucose is the only sugar that is normally absorbed against a concentration gradient in the intestine, making it the most likely correct answer.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opc\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
