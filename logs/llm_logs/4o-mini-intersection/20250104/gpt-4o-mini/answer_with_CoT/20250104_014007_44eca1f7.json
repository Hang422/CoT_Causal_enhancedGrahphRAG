  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Alpha-1 adrenergic blockers are commonly used to relieve symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) by relaxing smooth muscle in the prostate and bladder neck, which reduces urinary obstruction. Among the options provided, Tamsulosin is a selective alpha-1A adrenergic blocker that specifically targets receptors in the prostate, leading to improved urinary flow and significant symptomatic relief in BPH. Prazosin, while an alpha-1 blocker, is less selective and primarily used for hypertension, making it less effective for BPH symptoms. Oxazocin is also an alpha-1 blocker but is not commonly used for BPH, and Dolazoline is an alpha-2 agonist, which is not indicated for BPH. Therefore, Tamsulosin is the best-supported option for providing symptomatic relief in BPH.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}",
