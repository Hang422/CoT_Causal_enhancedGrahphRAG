  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Cardiac muscle is characterized by several distinct features. It is striated, which means it has a banded appearance due to the arrangement of sarcomeres, similar to skeletal muscle. Cardiac muscle also has large T tubules that facilitate the rapid transmission of action potentials and calcium influx necessary for contraction. The troponin system is present in cardiac muscle, playing a crucial role in the regulation of contraction by binding calcium ions. However, caldesmon is primarily associated with smooth muscle, where it acts as a regulatory protein. In cardiac muscle, the main regulatory proteins involved in contraction are troponin and tropomyosin, not caldesmon. Therefore, the statement regarding caldesmon being an important regulatory protein in cardiac muscle is incorrect, making it the exception among the listed features.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}",
