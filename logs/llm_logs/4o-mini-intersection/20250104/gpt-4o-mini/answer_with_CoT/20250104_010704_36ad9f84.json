  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Herpes simplex encephalitis is primarily treated with antiviral medications, with Acyclovir being the first-line treatment due to its effectiveness against the herpes simplex virus. Vidarabine is also an antiviral that can be used, although it is less commonly prescribed today. Ganciclovir is primarily used for cytomegalovirus infections and is not indicated for herpes simplex virus infections. Amantadine, on the other hand, is an antiviral medication that is primarily used for influenza and does not have a role in treating herpes simplex encephalitis. Therefore, the drug that is not used in the treatment of herpes simplex encephalitis is Amantadine.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
