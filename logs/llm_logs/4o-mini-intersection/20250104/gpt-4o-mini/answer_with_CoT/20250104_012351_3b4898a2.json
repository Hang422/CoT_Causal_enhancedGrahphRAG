  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"In the context of tuberculosis, steroids are used to manage inflammatory complications associated with the disease. In cases of meningitis and pericarditis, steroids are indicated to reduce inflammation and improve outcomes. For adrenal involvement, steroids are necessary to address adrenal insufficiency. However, in ileo-caecal tuberculosis, the use of steroids is generally contraindicated as they can exacerbate the infection and lead to complications. Therefore, the correct answer is that steroids are not indicated in ileo-caecal tuberculosis.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opc\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}",
