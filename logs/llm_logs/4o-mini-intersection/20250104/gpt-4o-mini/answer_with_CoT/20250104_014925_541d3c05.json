Chloroquine\nopb. Betamethasone\nopc. Chloramphenicol\nopd. Zidovudine\n\n### Reasoning Chains for Validation:\n- CHAIN: \"Chloroquine\" -> \"used for malaria treatment\" -> \"not commonly associated with myopathy\" -> 85%\n- CHAIN: \"Betamethasone\" -> \"a corticosteroid\" -> \"can cause muscle weakness\" -> \"associated with myopathy\" -> 70%\n- CHAIN: \"Chloramphenicol\" -> \"antibiotic used for bacterial infections\" -> \"rarely associated with myopathy\" -> \"possible but not common\" -> 60%\n- CHAIN: \"Zidovudine\" -> \"used for HIV treatment\" -> \"known to cause myopathy\" -> \"high association with muscle damage\" -> 90%\n\n### Retrieved Validation Paths:\n- (Chloroquine)-TREATS->(Malaria)\n- (Betamethasone)-INTERACTS_WITH/ISA->(Adrenal Cortex Hormones)\n- (Zidovudine)-PREVENTS->(HIV)\n- (Adrenal Cortex Hormones)-CAUSES->(Paresis)\n\n            ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3.

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"To determine which drug does not cause myopathy, we analyze each option based on known pharmacological effects. Chloroquine is primarily used for malaria treatment and is not commonly associated with myopathy, making it a strong candidate. Betamethasone, a corticosteroid, is known to potentially cause muscle weakness and myopathy, particularly with long-term use. Chloramphenicol, while primarily an antibiotic, has rare associations with myopathy, but it is not a common side effect. Zidovudine, used in HIV treatment, has a well-documented association with myopathy and muscle damage. Given this analysis, Chloroquine stands out as the drug least likely to cause myopathy. Therefore, the most likely correct answer is Chloroquine.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
