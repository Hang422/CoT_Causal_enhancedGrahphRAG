Methimazole\nopb. Propylthiouraril\nopc. Carbimazole\nopd.

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"In the management of hyperthyroidism during pregnancy, particularly in the first trimester, the safety of the drug for both the mother and the developing fetus is paramount. Methimazole is known to have potential teratogenic effects, especially in the first trimester, which raises concerns about its use. Carbimazole, being a pro-drug of Methimazole, shares similar risks. Perchlorate is not commonly used due to its potential side effects and limited evidence of safety in pregnancy. Propylthiouracil (PTU) is generally considered the drug of choice in the first trimester because it has a better safety profile and is less associated with teratogenic effects compared to Methimazole. Therefore, based on the consensus in medical literature, Propylthiouracil is the preferred treatment for hyperthyroidism in the first trimester of pregnancy.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
