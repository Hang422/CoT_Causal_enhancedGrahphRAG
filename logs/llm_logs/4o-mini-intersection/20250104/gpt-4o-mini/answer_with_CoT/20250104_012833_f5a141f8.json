  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Adrenal insufficiency is characterized by a deficiency in cortisol and aldosterone production. This leads to several physiological changes: 1) Hyponatremia occurs due to decreased aldosterone, which normally promotes sodium retention. 2) Hyperkalemia results from decreased aldosterone, which also regulates potassium excretion. 3) Hypoglycemia can occur due to insufficient cortisol, which is essential for gluconeogenesis and maintaining blood glucose levels. 4) Metabolic alkalosis is typically not associated with adrenal insufficiency; rather, it is more commonly linked to conditions that cause excessive loss of hydrogen ions or bicarbonate retention. Therefore, metabolic alkalosis is the least likely to be associated with adrenal insufficiency compared to the other options. Based on this reasoning, the correct answer is metabolic alkalosis.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}",
