  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Subacute combined degeneration of the cord (SACD) is primarily associated with vitamin B12 deficiency. This condition is characterized by degeneration of the dorsal columns and corticospinal tracts, which are crucial for proprioception and motor function. Vitamin B12 is essential for myelin synthesis, and its deficiency leads to neurological symptoms due to myelin degeneration. Other vitamin deficiencies listed (A, B6, B9) do not typically cause SACD. Therefore, the most supported option based on medical consensus is vitamin B12 deficiency.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
