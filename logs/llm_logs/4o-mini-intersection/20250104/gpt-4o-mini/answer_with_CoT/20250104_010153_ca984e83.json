Single dose in ascariasis\nopb. Immunostimulant\nopc. Paralysis of worms by depolarisation\nopd. Immunodepressant in high doses\n\n### Reasoning Chains for Validation:\n- CHAIN: \"Levamisole is an anthelmintic\" -> \"used for treating ascariasis\" -> \"single dose effective\" -> \"not used as immunodepressant\" -> 85%\n- CHAIN: \"Levamisole acts as an immunostimulant\" -> \"enhances immune response\" -> \"not typically used as immunodepressant\" -> \"high doses can have immunosuppressive effects\" -> 75%\n- CHAIN: \"Levamisole causes paralysis of worms\" -> \"through depolarization mechanism\" -> \"effective against certain helminths\" -> \"not primarily used as immunodepressant\" -> 80%\n- CHAIN: \"Levamisole is used in high doses\" -> \"can lead to immunosuppression\" -> \"not its primary indication\" -> \"conflicting uses in different contexts\" -> 70%\n\n### Retrieved Validation Paths:\n- (Levamisole)-TREATS->(Ascariasis)\n- (Levamisole)-TREATS->(Diabetes Mellitus, Insulin-Dependent)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Immunity)\n- (Levamisole)-TREATS->(Infection)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Immunity)\n- (Levamisole)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Prodigiozan)-PART_OF->(Cells)-PART_OF->(Myocardium)-LOCATION_OF->(Therapeutic immunosuppression)\n\n            ### Task:\n                1.

If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3.

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Levamisole is primarily known as an anthelmintic agent used to treat infections caused by certain helminths, such as ascariasis. It is effective in a single dose for this purpose. Additionally, Levamisole has immunomodulatory properties and is used as an immunostimulant, enhancing the immune response. It works by causing paralysis of worms through a depolarization mechanism, which is a key aspect of its anthelmintic action. However, while high doses of Levamisole can lead to immunosuppression, this is not its primary use and is considered a side effect rather than a therapeutic indication. Therefore, the option that does not align with the established uses of Levamisole is 'immunodepressant in high doses,' as this is not a recognized or intended use of the drug. Thus, the correct answer is option opd.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
