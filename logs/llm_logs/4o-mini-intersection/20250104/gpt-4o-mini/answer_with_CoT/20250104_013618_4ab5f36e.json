Flutamide\nopb. Finasteride\nopc. Prazosin\nopd. Minoxidil\n\n### Reasoning Chains for Validation:\n- CHAIN: \"5α reductase inhibitor\" -> \"reduces dihydrotestosterone levels\" -> \"effective in treating benign prostatic hypertrophy\" -> \"also effective in male pattern baldness\" -> \"Finasteride\" -> 95%\n- CHAIN: \"Finasteride\" -> \"inhibits 5α reductase\" -> \"lowers DHT\" -> \"improves urinary symptoms in BPH\" -> \"promotes hair regrowth in male pattern baldness\" -> 90%\n- CHAIN: \"5α reductase inhibitors\" -> \"commonly used for BPH\" -> \"Finasteride is one of them\" -> \"also indicated for male pattern baldness\" -> \"other options do not have this dual indication\" -> 85%\n\n### Retrieved Validation Paths:\n- (Finasteride)-TREATS->(Androgenetic Alopecia)\n- (Stanolone)-TREATS->(Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia)\n- (Androgenetic Alopecia)-PREDISPOSES->(Atherosclerosis)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Genes)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Finasteride)\n- (Androgenetic Alopecia)-PREDISPOSES->(Insulin Resistance)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Genes)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Finasteride)\n- (Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia)-PREDISPOSES->(Complication)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Genes)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Finasteride)\n- (Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia)-CAUSES->(Obstruction)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Genes)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Finasteride)\n- (Finasteride)-PREVENTS/TREATS->(Complication)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Oxidoreductase)\n\n            ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n                \n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n            "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The question asks for a 5α reductase inhibitor that is effective in both benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH) and male pattern baldness. Finasteride is a well-known 5α reductase inhibitor that reduces levels of dihydrotestosterone (DHT), which is implicated in both conditions. It is FDA-approved for the treatment of BPH and is also indicated for androgenetic alopecia (male pattern baldness). Other options listed, such as Flutamide, Prazosin, and Minoxidil, do not have this dual indication. Flutamide is an anti-androgen, Prazosin is an alpha-1 blocker used for hypertension and BPH, and Minoxidil is a vasodilator used for hair loss but not a 5α reductase inhibitor. Therefore, the most supported and correct answer is Finasteride.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
