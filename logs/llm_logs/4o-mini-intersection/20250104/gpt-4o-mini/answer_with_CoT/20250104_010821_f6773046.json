Ascaris\nopb. Filariasis\nopc. Malaria\nopd. Oncocerciasis\n\n### Reasoning Chains for Validation:\n- CHAIN: \"Ivermectin is an antiparasitic medication\" -> \"effective against certain parasitic infections\" -> \"indicated for Onchocerciasis\" -> \"indicated for Filariasis\" -> \"not indicated for Malaria\" -> 95%\n- CHAIN: \"Ivermectin treats various parasitic infections\" -> \"approved for use in Onchocerciasis\" -> \"approved for use in Filariasis\" -> \"not effective against Plasmodium species\" -> \"Malaria is caused by Plasmodium\" -> 90%\n- CHAIN: \"Ivermectin is used for specific parasitic diseases\" -> \"effective for Ascaris\" -> \"effective for Onchocerciasis\" -> \"effective for Filariasis\" -> \"ineffective for Malaria\" -> 85%\n- CHAIN: \"Ivermectin is indicated for certain infections\" -> \"indicated for Onchocerciasis\" -> \"indicated for Filariasis\" -> \"not indicated for Malaria\" -> \"Malaria requires different treatment\" -> 92%\n\n### Retrieved Validation Paths:\n- (Ivermectin)-TREATS->(Parasitic Diseases)\n- (Ivermectin)-TREATS->(Onchocerciasis)\n- (Filariasis)-CAUSES->(Disease)-CAUSES->(Malaria)\n- (Filariasis)-CAUSES->(Symptoms)-CAUSES->(Malaria)\n\n            ### Task:\n                1.

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Ivermectin is an antiparasitic medication that is effective against several parasitic infections. It is indicated for Onchocerciasis (river blindness) and Filariasis (caused by filarial worms). Ivermectin is also effective against certain nematodes, including those causing Ascaris infections. However, it is not indicated for Malaria, which is caused by Plasmodium species and requires different treatment, typically with antimalarial drugs. Therefore, the correct answer is that Ivermectin is not indicated for Malaria.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opc\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
