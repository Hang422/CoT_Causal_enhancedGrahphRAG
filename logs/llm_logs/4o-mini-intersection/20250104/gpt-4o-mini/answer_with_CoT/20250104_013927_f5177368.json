  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Vitamin A is a fat-soluble vitamin that exists in several forms, including retinol, retinal, and retinoic acids. Each of these forms plays a crucial role in various biological functions. Retinol is important for vision and acts as a precursor to retinal, which is essential for the formation of rhodopsin, a pigment in the retina that is vital for low-light vision. Retinal is directly involved in the visual cycle. Retinoic acids, on the other hand, are involved in gene expression and act as signaling molecules that regulate the transcription of target genes, impacting processes such as cell differentiation and immune function. Given that all these forms of vitamin A are functionally related and contribute to essential physiological processes, the most accurate answer is that the function of vitamin A is related to all of the above forms. Therefore, the best-supported option is 'All of the above'.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
