Stroma\nopb. Corpora albicans\nopc. Corpora lutea\nopd. Mature follicles\n\n### Reasoning Chains for Validation:\n- CHAIN: \"Progesterone is a hormone\" -> \"produced primarily in the ovaries\" -> \"mainly by the corpus luteum\" -> \"corpus luteum is formed after ovulation\" -> 95%\n- CHAIN: \"Ovarian follicles develop during the menstrual cycle\" -> \"mature follicles release an egg\" -> \"after ovulation, the follicle transforms into the corpus luteum\" -> \"corpus luteum produces progesterone\" -> 90%\n- CHAIN: \"Stroma is supportive tissue in the ovary\" -> \"does not primarily produce hormones\" -> \"progesterone is mainly produced by the corpus luteum\" -> 85%\n- CHAIN: \"Corpora albicans is a degenerated form of the corpus luteum\" -> \"does not produce significant amounts of progesterone\" -> \"progesterone is primarily produced by the corpus luteum\" -> 80%\n- CHAIN: \"Mature follicles are involved in ovulation\" -> \"they do not produce progesterone\" -> \"progesterone is produced by the corpus luteum\" -> 90%\n\n### Retrieved Validation Paths:\n- (Structure of corpus luteum of ovary)-LOCATION_OF->(Progesterone)\n- (Progesterone)-CAUSES->(uptake)-PROCESS_OF->(Structure of corpus luteum of ovary)\n- (Progesterone)-CAUSES->(Ovarian Cycle)-PROCESS_OF->(Ovary)\n- (Progesterone)-CAUSES->(paracrine)-PROCESS_OF->(Ovary)\n- (Progesterone)-CAUSES->(Physiologic Function)-PROCESS_OF->(Ovary)\n- (Ovarian Follicle)-LOCATION_OF->(Progesterone)\n- (Hormones)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Progesterone)\n- (Ovarian Follicle)-LOCATION_OF->(Estradiol)-PART_OF->(Hair follicle structure)\n- (Ovary)-PART_OF->(Structure of corpus luteum of ovary)\n\n            ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3.

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Progesterone is primarily produced in the ovaries, specifically by the corpus luteum, which forms after ovulation from the remnants of the mature follicle. The stroma of the ovary does not produce hormones, and the corpora albicans is a degenerated form of the corpus luteum that does not produce significant amounts of progesterone. Mature follicles are involved in the ovulation process but do not produce progesterone themselves. Therefore, the best-supported option is that progesterone production is primarily by the corpus lutea.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opc\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
