He has a history of being treated for duodenal ulcer 4 years back. Investigation reveals elevation of gastrin levels. Which of the following statement is true regarding gastrin?\n\n            ### Options\n            opa. Secreted by parietal cells of stomach\nopb. Secreted by alpha ceils of pancreas\nopc. Decreases bicarbonate content in pancreatic secretion\nopd. It gets stimulated by endoluminal peptides in stomach\n\n### Reasoning Chains for Validation:\n- CHAIN: \"Gastrin is a hormone\" -> \"Secreted by G cells in the gastric mucosa\" -> \"Stimulates gastric acid secretion\" -> \"Increases gastric motility\" -> \"Elevated levels indicate possible gastrinoma or Zollinger-Ellison syndrome\" -> 85%\n- CHAIN: \"Gastrin stimulates acid secretion\" -> \"Increases gastric acidity\" -> \"Inhibits gastric emptying\" -> \"May lead to indigestion symptoms\" -> \"Elevated gastrin levels correlate with gastric pathology\" -> 90%\n- CHAIN: \"Gastrin is released in response to food intake\" -> \"Stimulated by peptides and amino acids\" -> \"Increases gastric acid production\" -> \"Facilitates digestion\" -> \"Elevated levels can indicate underlying conditions\" -> 80%\n- CHAIN: \"Gastrin is not secreted by parietal cells\" -> \"Parietal cells secrete hydrochloric acid\" -> \"G cells secrete gastrin\" -> \"Confusion may arise regarding source of secretion\" -> \"Correct statement is that gastrin is secreted by G cells\" -> 95%\n\n### Retrieved Validation Paths:\n- (Gastrins)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cells)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Parietal Cells, Gastric)\n- (Parietal Cells, Gastric)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Chief Cell)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Gastrins)\n- (Gastrins)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cells)-INTERACTS_WITH/LOCATION_OF->(Amino Acids)\n- (Gastrins)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cells)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Gastrin-Secreting Cells)\n- (Gastrins)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Melanoma Cell)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Gastrin-Secreting Cells)\n- (Hormones)-PART_OF->(Gastrin-Secreting Cells)\n- (Gastrins)-TREATS->(Disease)-COMPLICATES->(Confusion)\n\n            ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3.

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Gastrin is a hormone primarily secreted by G cells located in the gastric mucosa, not by parietal cells. Parietal cells are responsible for secreting hydrochloric acid, which is stimulated by gastrin. The statement that gastrin is secreted by alpha cells of the pancreas is incorrect, as alpha cells secrete glucagon. Gastrin does not decrease bicarbonate content in pancreatic secretion; rather, it stimulates gastric acid secretion. Gastrin is indeed stimulated by endoluminal peptides in the stomach, which is a correct statement. Therefore, the most accurate statement regarding gastrin is that it gets stimulated by endoluminal peptides in the stomach, making option opd the correct choice.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
