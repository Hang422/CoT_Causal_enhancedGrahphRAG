Morphine\nopb. Dextromethorphan\nopc. Diphenhydramine\nopd.

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Dextromethorphan is known to act as an NMDA receptor antagonist, which can lead to dissociative effects and hallucinations, especially at high doses. Diphenhydramine, an antihistamine with anticholinergic properties, can also cause CNS effects, including confusion and hallucinations, particularly in the elderly or at high doses. Morphine, while it can alter mental status, is more associated with sedation rather than hallucinations. Aprepitant is not commonly associated with hallucinations. Given the evidence, Dextromethorphan is the most likely antitussive to lead to hallucinations, supported by its pharmacological profile. Therefore, the best-supported option is Dextromethorphan.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
