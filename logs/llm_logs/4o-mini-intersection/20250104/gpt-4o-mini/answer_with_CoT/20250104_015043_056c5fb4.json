  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Gonococcal urethritis is primarily treated with ceftriaxone, which is a first-line cephalosporin antibiotic. For non-gonococcal urethritis, azithromycin is often used due to its effectiveness against Chlamydia, a common causative agent. While cefepime is also a cephalosporin, it is not typically used as a first-line treatment for urethritis. Clindamycin and metronidazole are not standard treatments for either type of urethritis. Azithromycin is effective for both gonococcal and non-gonococcal urethritis, making it the most appropriate choice in this context. Therefore, the drug of choice for both types of urethritis is azithromycin.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}",
