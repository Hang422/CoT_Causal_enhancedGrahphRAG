Amyloidosis associated with multiple myeloma has the poorest prognosis\nopb. Fine - needle biopsy of subcutaneous abdominal fat is a simple & reliable method for diagnosing secondary systemic amyloidosis\nopc. Hepatic amyloid disease produces hepatomegaly but rarely jaundice\nopd. Amyloidosis of the spleen is associated with severe anemia\n\n### Reasoning Chains for Validation:\n- CHAIN: \"Amyloidosis associated with multiple myeloma\" -> \"generally poor prognosis\" -> \"widely accepted in medical literature\" -> 95%\n- CHAIN: \"Fine-needle biopsy of subcutaneous abdominal fat\" -> \"used for diagnosing secondary systemic amyloidosis\" -> \"considered simple and reliable\" -> 90%\n- CHAIN: \"Hepatic amyloid disease\" -> \"can cause hepatomegaly\" -> \"jaundice is uncommon\" -> 85%\n- CHAIN: \"Amyloidosis of the spleen\" -> \"can lead to splenomegaly\" -> \"not typically associated with severe anemia\" -> \"conflict with known associations\" -> 70%\n\n### Retrieved Validation Paths:\n- (Splenomegaly)-CAUSES->(Anemia)\n- (Spleen)-LOCATION_OF->(Splenomegaly)\n- (Hepatomegaly)-CAUSES->(Disease)-CAUSES->(Icterus)\n- (Hepatomegaly)-CAUSES->(Syndrome)-CAUSES->(Icterus)\n- (Amyloidosis)-CAUSES->(Disease)-CAUSES->(Splenomegaly)\n- (Amyloidosis)-CAUSES->(Infection)-CAUSES->(Splenomegaly)\n\n            ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3.

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"To determine which statement is not true concerning amyloidosis, we analyze each option based on established medical knowledge. Option 'opa' states that amyloidosis associated with multiple myeloma has the poorest prognosis, which is generally accepted as true due to the aggressive nature of both conditions. Option 'opb' claims that fine-needle biopsy of subcutaneous abdominal fat is a simple and reliable method for diagnosing secondary systemic amyloidosis, which is also widely recognized in clinical practice. Option 'opc' mentions that hepatic amyloid disease produces hepatomegaly but rarely jaundice, which aligns with the understanding that while hepatomegaly is common, jaundice is less frequent. Finally, option 'opd' states that amyloidosis of the spleen is associated with severe anemia. This is less supported, as while splenic involvement can occur, it is not typically associated with severe anemia; rather, anemia in amyloidosis is more often due to chronic disease or other factors. Therefore, option 'opd' is the most likely incorrect statement regarding amyloidosis.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
