  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Atropine is a muscarinic receptor antagonist that primarily blocks the effects of acetylcholine at muscarinic receptors. This means it can effectively prevent bradycardia caused by acetylcholine infusion, as it inhibits the parasympathetic effects that would normally slow the heart rate. However, atropine does not affect nicotinic receptors, which means it cannot block the increased blood pressure caused by nicotine, as nicotine acts on nicotinic receptors. Additionally, neostigmine, an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, increases acetylcholine levels, enhancing muscle strength through nicotinic receptors at the neuromuscular junction, which is also unaffected by atropine. Therefore, the only effect that can be blocked by atropine is the bradycardia caused by acetylcholine. Thus, the correct answer is that only bradycardia is blocked, not all effects. The best-supported option is 'opc' for bradycardia caused by acetylcholine infusion. The reasoning leads to a confidence score of 95% due to the clear pharmacological actions of atropine.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opc\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
