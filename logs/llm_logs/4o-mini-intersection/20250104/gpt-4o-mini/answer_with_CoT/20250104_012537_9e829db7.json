Streptomycin\nopb. Ethambutol\nopc. Capreomycin\nopd. Rifampicin\n\n### Reasoning Chains for Validation:\n- CHAIN: \"Streptomycin\" -> \"primarily excreted by kidneys\" -> \"accumulation in severe renal failure\" -> \"risk of toxicity\" -> 70%\n- CHAIN: \"Ethambutol\" -> \"partially renally excreted\" -> \"dose adjustment required in renal failure\" -> \"can be used with caution\" -> 85%\n- CHAIN: \"Capreomycin\" -> \"excreted by kidneys\" -> \"risk of nephrotoxicity in renal failure\" -> \"not recommended\" -> 60%\n- CHAIN: \"Rifampicin\" -> \"primarily metabolized by liver\" -> \"minimal renal excretion\" -> \"generally safe in renal failure\" -> 90%\n\n### Retrieved Validation Paths:\n- (Streptomycin)-TREATS->(Infection)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(biological adaptation to stress)-PROCESS_OF->(Kidney)\n- (Streptomycin)-TREATS->(Tuberculosis)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(biological adaptation to stress)-PROCESS_OF->(Kidney)\n- (Streptomycin)-TREATS->(Infection)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(tissue tropism)-PROCESS_OF->(Kidney)\n\n            ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2.

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"In evaluating the antitubercular drugs for use in severe renal failure, we consider their pharmacokinetics and safety profiles. Streptomycin is primarily excreted by the kidneys, leading to a risk of accumulation and toxicity in patients with renal failure. Ethambutol is partially renally excreted, and while it can be used with caution, dose adjustments are necessary. Capreomycin is also excreted by the kidneys and poses a risk of nephrotoxicity, making it unsuitable for use in severe renal failure. Rifampicin, on the other hand, is primarily metabolized by the liver with minimal renal excretion, making it generally safe for use in patients with renal impairment. Therefore, the best option for use in severe renal failure is Rifampicin.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}",
