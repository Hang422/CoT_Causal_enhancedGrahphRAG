Proprioception\nopb. Vibratory sense\nopc. Heat sensation\nopd. Touch\n\n### Reasoning Chains for Validation:\n- CHAIN: \"Dorsal column function\" -> \"Carries proprioception\" -> \"Carries vibratory sense\" -> \"Does not carry heat sensation\" -> 95%\n- CHAIN: \"Dorsal column pathway\" -> \"Transmits touch sensation\" -> \"Transmits proprioception\" -> \"Does not transmit heat sensation\" -> 90%\n- CHAIN: \"Dorsal column\" -> \"Involved in fine touch\" -> \"Involved in proprioception\" -> \"Not involved in heat sensation\" -> 85%\n- CHAIN: \"Dorsal column\" -> \"Carries sensory modalities\" -> \"Includes touch and proprioception\" -> \"Excludes heat sensation\" -> 80%\n\n### Retrieved Validation Paths:\n- (Dorsal funiculus)-LOCATION_OF->(SLIT2 gene|SLIT3|SLIT2)-PART_OF->(Endothelium)-LOCATION_OF->(Therapeutic tactile stimulation)\n\n            ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3.

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The dorsal column of the spinal cord is primarily responsible for transmitting fine touch, proprioception, and vibratory sense. It does not carry heat sensation, which is transmitted through the spinothalamic tract. The reasoning is supported by the established understanding of sensory pathways in the nervous system. Therefore, the correct answer is that heat sensation is not carried in the dorsal column.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opc\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
