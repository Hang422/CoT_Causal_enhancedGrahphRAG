  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"In the context of chemotherapy-induced vomiting, all three drugs listed have established roles. Aprepitant is a substance P antagonist that effectively reduces nausea and vomiting associated with chemotherapy. Dexamethasone, a corticosteroid, has anti-inflammatory properties that can also help alleviate nausea. Ondansetron, a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist, is widely used to prevent nausea and vomiting in patients undergoing chemotherapy. Given that all three options are effective in managing chemotherapy-induced vomiting, the best answer is 'All of the above'. This reflects the consensus in clinical practice where a combination of these agents may be used for optimal control of nausea and vomiting in cancer patients. Therefore, the most supported option is 'All of the above'.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
