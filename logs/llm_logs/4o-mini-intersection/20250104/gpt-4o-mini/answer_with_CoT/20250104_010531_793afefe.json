  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Schizophrenia is primarily characterized by psychotic symptoms such as hallucinations and delusions. The standard treatment for managing these symptoms is the use of anti-psychotic medications, which have been shown to be effective in reducing these symptoms and improving overall functioning. While mood stabilizers and anti-depressants may be used in some cases, they are not considered first-line treatments for schizophrenia. Anti-epileptics are also not standard treatments for schizophrenia. Therefore, the most appropriate and consensus-supported treatment option for schizophrenia is anti-psychotics.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
