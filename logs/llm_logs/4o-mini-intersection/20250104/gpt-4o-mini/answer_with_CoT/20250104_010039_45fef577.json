Propanolol\nopb. Aiprazolam\nopc. Buspirone\nopd. Haloperidol\n\n### Reasoning Chains for Validation:\n- CHAIN: \"Propranolol\" -> \"used for performance anxiety\" -> \"reduces physical symptoms of anxiety\" -> 85%\n- CHAIN: \"Alprazolam\" -> \"benzodiazepine medication\" -> \"commonly prescribed for anxiety disorders\" -> 95%\n- CHAIN: \"Buspirone\" -> \"anxiolytic medication\" -> \"used for generalized anxiety disorder\" -> 90%\n- CHAIN: \"Haloperidol\" -> \"antipsychotic medication\" -> \"not primarily used for anxiety\" -> \"used for schizophrenia and acute psychosis\" -> 80%\n- CHAIN: \"Haloperidol\" -> \"not indicated for anxiety treatment\" -> \"conflicts with common anxiety treatment guidelines\" -> 75%\n\n### Retrieved Validation Paths:\n- (Propranolol)-TREATS->(Anxiety)\n- (Haloperidol)-TREATS->(Irritable Bowel Syndrome)-COMPLICATES->(Anxiety)\n- (Haloperidol)-TREATS->(Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease)-COMPLICATES->(Anxiety)\n- (Haloperidol)-TREATS->(Hypertensive disease)-PREDISPOSES->(Anxiety)\n- (Antipsychotic Agents)-TREATS->(Anxiety)\n- (Haloperidol)-INTERACTS_WITH/ISA->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Antipsychotic Agents)\n\n            ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3.

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"To determine which drug is not used for anxiety, we analyze each option: Propranolol is often used for performance anxiety as it helps reduce physical symptoms. Alprazolam is a benzodiazepine that is commonly prescribed for anxiety disorders. Buspirone is an anxiolytic specifically indicated for generalized anxiety disorder. Haloperidol, however, is an antipsychotic medication primarily used for treating schizophrenia and acute psychosis, and it is not indicated for anxiety treatment. Therefore, Haloperidol is the drug that is not used for anxiety.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
