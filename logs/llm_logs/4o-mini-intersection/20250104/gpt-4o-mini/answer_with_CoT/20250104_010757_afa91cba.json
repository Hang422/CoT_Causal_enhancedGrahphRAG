  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Aldosterone is a steroid hormone produced by the adrenal cortex that plays a crucial role in regulating sodium and potassium levels in the body. It primarily acts on the kidneys, specifically targeting the renal tubules. The most significant site of action for aldosterone is the collecting duct, where it promotes sodium reabsorption and potassium excretion. While aldosterone does have some effects on other parts of the nephron, such as the distal convoluted tubule, its primary and most impactful action occurs in the collecting duct. This is supported by multiple chains of reasoning that consistently point to the collecting duct as the main site of aldosterone action. Therefore, the best-supported option is the collecting duct.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
