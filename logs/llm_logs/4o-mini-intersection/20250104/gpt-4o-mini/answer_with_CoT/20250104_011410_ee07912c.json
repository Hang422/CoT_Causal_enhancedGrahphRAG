Cinchonism\nopb. Hyperglycemia\nopc. Hypoglycemia\nopd. Hypokalemia\n\n### Reasoning Chains for Validation:\n- CHAIN: \"Quinine administration\" -> \"increased levels of quinine in the bloodstream\" -> \"stimulation of the central nervous system\" -> \"sweating and palpitation\" -> \"likely due to cinchonism\" -> 85%\n- CHAIN: \"Quinine given to treat malaria\" -> \"possible side effects include cinchonism\" -> \"cinchonism characterized by sweating and palpitation\" -> \"sweating and palpitation observed\" -> \"likely cause is cinchonism\" -> 90%\n- CHAIN: \"Quinine can cause adverse effects\" -> \"sweating and palpitation noted in the patient\" -> \"cinchonism is a known effect of quinine\" -> \"sweating and palpitation likely due to cinchonism\" -> 80%\n- CHAIN: \"Quinine affects the cardiovascular system\" -> \"can lead to symptoms like palpitation\" -> \"sweating may also occur\" -> \"cinchonism is a possible explanation\" -> 75%\n\n### Retrieved Validation Paths:\n- (Quinine)-TREATS->(Disease)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Blood Circulation)\n- (Quinine)-TREATS->(Infection)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Blood Circulation)\n- (Quinine)-ISA->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-PART_OF->(Cells)-PART_OF->(Extracellular Matrix)-LOCATION_OF->(Stimulation procedure)\n\n            ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n                \n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n            "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Quinine is known to cause a range of side effects, one of which is cinchonism. Cinchonism is characterized by symptoms such as tinnitus, headache, nausea, and cardiovascular effects including sweating and palpitations. Given that the patient experienced sweating and palpitation after quinine administration, it is most likely that these symptoms are due to cinchonism rather than other options like hyperglycemia, hypoglycemia, or hypokalemia, which do not typically present with these specific symptoms in the context of quinine use. Therefore, the most likely cause of the symptoms observed in this patient is cinchonism.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}",
