INH\nopb. Erythromycin estolate\nopc. Pyrazinamide\nopd. Ethionamide\n\n### Reasoning Chains for Validation:\n- CHAIN: \"Erythromycin estolate\" -> \"known to cause cholestatic jaundice\" -> \"inhibits bile flow\" -> \"increased bilirubin levels\" -> 85%\n- CHAIN: \"INH\" -> \"associated with hepatotoxicity\" -> \"can cause jaundice\" -> \"not primarily cholestatic\" -> 70%\n- CHAIN: \"Pyrazinamide\" -> \"can cause liver dysfunction\" -> \"may lead to jaundice\" -> \"not specifically cholestatic\" -> 65%\n- CHAIN: \"Ethionamide\" -> \"can cause liver toxicity\" -> \"may result in jaundice\" -> \"not commonly cholestatic\" -> 60%\n\n### Retrieved Validation Paths:\n- (Pyrazinamide)-TREATS->(Disease)-CAUSES->(Liver Dysfunction)\n- (Pyrazinamide)-TREATS->(Obesity)-CAUSES->(Liver Dysfunction)\n- (Pyrazinamide)-TREATS->(Infection)-CAUSES->(Liver Dysfunction)\n- (Ethionamide)-TREATS->(Infection)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(tissue tropism)-PROCESS_OF->(Liver)\n\n            ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3.

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Cholestatic jaundice is characterized by impaired bile flow, leading to increased levels of conjugated bilirubin. Among the options provided, Erythromycin estolate is well-documented to cause cholestatic jaundice due to its effects on bile flow. INH (Isoniazid) and Pyrazinamide are known to cause hepatotoxicity and can lead to jaundice, but they are not primarily associated with cholestatic jaundice. Ethionamide can also cause liver toxicity but is not commonly linked to cholestatic jaundice. Therefore, based on the evidence and consensus in the literature, Erythromycin estolate is the most likely cause of cholestatic jaundice among the options listed.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
