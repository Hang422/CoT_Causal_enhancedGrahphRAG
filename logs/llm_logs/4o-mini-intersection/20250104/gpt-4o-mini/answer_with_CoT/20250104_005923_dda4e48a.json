Produced by alpha cells of pancreas\nopb. Two polypeptide chains are bound by disulfide linkages\nopc. Shifts potassium outside the cell\nopd. S.c insulin tl/2 is 60 mins\n\n### Reasoning Chains for Validation:\n- CHAIN: \"Insulin is a hormone\" -> \"produced by beta cells of the pancreas\" -> \"not produced by alpha cells\" -> \"option a is incorrect\" -> 95%\n- CHAIN: s\" -> \"connected by disulfide linkages\" -> \"this is a true statement\" -> \"option b is correct\" -> 90%\n- CHAIN: \"Insulin facilitates cellular uptake of glucose\" -> \"also affects potassium levels\" -> \"shifts potassium into the cell\" -> \"option c is incorrect\" -> 90%\n- CHAIN: \"Subcutaneous insulin has a half-life\" -> \"approximately 60 minutes\" -> \"this is a true statement\" -> \"option d is correct\" -> 85%\n\n### Retrieved Validation Paths:\n- (Insulin)-CAUSES->(Energy Metabolism)-PROCESS_OF->(Pancreas)\n- (Insulin)-CAUSES->(physiological aspects)-PROCESS_OF->(Pancreas)\n- (Insulin)-CAUSES->(Excretory function)-PROCESS_OF->(Pancreas)\n- (Serum potassium assay)-DIAGNOSES->(Accelerated atrioventricular conduction)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cells)\n\n            ### Task:\n                1.

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Insulin is a hormone produced by the beta cells of the pancreas, not the alpha cells, making option a incorrect. Insulin consists of two polypeptide chains (A and B) that are linked by disulfide bonds, which is a true statement, thus option b is correct. Insulin facilitates the uptake of glucose into cells and also shifts potassium into the cells, not outside, making option c incorrect. The half-life of subcutaneous insulin is approximately 60 minutes, which aligns with option d being correct. However, since option b is the only one that is definitively true without any ambiguity, it is the best-supported option. Therefore, the most likely correct answer is option b.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}",
