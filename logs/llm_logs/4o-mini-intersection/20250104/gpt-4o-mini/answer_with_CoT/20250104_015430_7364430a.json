Leucine\nopb. Lysine\nopc. Methionine\nopd. Proline\n\n### Reasoning Chains for Validation:\n- CHAIN: \"Essential amino acids are required for human health\" -> \"Leucine is classified as an essential amino acid\" -> \"Lysine is classified as an essential amino acid\" -> \"Methionine is classified as an essential amino acid\" -> \"Proline is classified as a non-essential amino acid\" -> \"Proline is the exception\" -> 95%\n- CHAIN: \"Essential amino acids must be obtained from diet\" -> \"Leucine is necessary for protein synthesis\" -> \"Lysine is necessary for growth and tissue repair\" -> \"Methionine is necessary for metabolism\" -> \"Proline can be synthesized by the body\" -> \"Proline is not essential\" -> 90%\n- CHAIN: \"Amino acids are categorized as essential or non-essential\" -> \"Leucine is essential\" -> \"Lysine is essential\" -> \"Methionine is essential\" -> \"Proline is non-essential\" -> \"Proline is the only non-essential in the list\" -> 85%\n\n### Retrieved Validation Paths:\n- (Amino Acids)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cells)-INTERACTS_WITH/LOCATION_OF->(Leucine)\n- (Leucine)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cells)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Lysine)\n- (Leucine)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Muscle Fibers)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Lysine)\n- (Amino Acids)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cells)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Lysine)\n- (Amino Acids)-TREATS->(Herpesvirus 4, Human)-LOCATION_OF->(Lysine)\n- (Lysine)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cells)-INTERACTS_WITH/LOCATION_OF->(Amino Acids)\n- (Amino Acids)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cells)-INTERACTS_WITH/LOCATION_OF->(Methionine)\n- (Amino Acids)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cells)-LOCATION_OF->(Proline)\n\n            ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n                \n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n            "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Essential amino acids are those that cannot be synthesized by the body and must be obtained through diet. The amino acids listed in the options are: Leucine, Lysine, Methionine, and Proline. Leucine, Lysine, and Methionine are all classified as essential amino acids, meaning they are required for various bodily functions and must be ingested through food. In contrast, Proline is classified as a non-essential amino acid because the body can synthesize it from other compounds. Therefore, Proline is the only amino acid in the list that is not essential. This reasoning aligns with established biochemical knowledge regarding amino acid classification.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
