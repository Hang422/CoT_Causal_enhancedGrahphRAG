Anti depressants\nopb. Anti psychotics\nopc. Anti epileptics\nopd. Mood stabilizers\n\n### Reasoning Chains for Validation:\n- CHAIN: \"Schizophrenia\" -> \"characterized by psychotic symptoms\" -> \"requires management of psychosis\" -> \"anti-psychotics are effective\" -> 95%\n- CHAIN: \"Schizophrenia\" -> \"often involves mood disturbances\" -> \"mood stabilizers may help\" -> \"not first-line treatment\" -> \"anti-psychotics are preferred\" -> 80%\n- CHAIN: \"Schizophrenia\" -> \"can have comorbid conditions\" -> \"anti-depressants may be used\" -> \"not primary treatment for schizophrenia\" -> \"anti-psychotics are standard\" -> 75%\n- CHAIN: \"Schizophrenia\" -> \"may involve seizures in some cases\" -> \"anti-epileptics could be considered\" -> \"not standard treatment\" -> \"anti-psychotics are primary\" -> 70%\n\n### Retrieved Validation Paths:\n- (Schizophrenia)-CAUSES->(Symptoms)-CAUSES->(Psychotic symptom)\n- (Schizophrenia)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(physiological aspects)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Oxygen)-TREATS->(Disturbance in mood)\n- (Schizophrenia)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(physiological aspects)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Hydrocortisone)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Disturbance in mood)\n- (Schizophrenia)-CAUSES->(Disease)-CAUSES->(Psychotic symptom)\n- (Schizophrenia)-CAUSES->(Infection)-CAUSES->(Psychotic symptom)\n- (Schizophrenia)-CAUSES->(Disease)-CAUSES->(Seizures)\n\n            ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3.

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Schizophrenia is primarily characterized by psychotic symptoms such as hallucinations and delusions. The standard treatment for managing these symptoms is the use of antipsychotic medications, which are specifically designed to target the underlying neurochemical imbalances associated with psychosis. While mood stabilizers, antidepressants, and antiepileptics may have roles in managing comorbid conditions or specific symptoms, they are not considered first-line treatments for schizophrenia itself. Therefore, the most appropriate and consensus-supported treatment for schizophrenia is antipsychotics.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
