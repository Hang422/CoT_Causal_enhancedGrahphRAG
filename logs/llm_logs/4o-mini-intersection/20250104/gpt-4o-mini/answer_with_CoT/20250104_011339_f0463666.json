Increase in glucagon/insulin ratio, increased CAMP and increased blood glucose\nopb. Decreased insulin, increased free fatty acid which is equivalent to blood glucose\nopc. Decreased insulin, increased free fatty acid which is not equivalent to blood glucose\nopd. Elevated insulin and free fatty acid, equivalent to blood glucose\n\n### Reasoning Chains for Validation:\n- CHAIN: \"Diabetes mellitus\" -> \"decreased insulin secretion\" -> \"increased glucagon/insulin ratio\" -> \"increased cAMP levels\" -> \"increased blood glucose\" -> 95%\n- CHAIN: \"Diabetes mellitus\" -> \"decreased insulin\" -> \"increased free fatty acids\" -> \"not equivalent to blood glucose\" -> 85%\n- CHAIN: \"Diabetes mellitus\" -> \"decreased insulin\" -> \"increased free fatty acids\" -> \"not equivalent to blood glucose\" -> \"possible confusion with metabolic state\" -> 70%\n- CHAIN: \"Diabetes mellitus\" -> \"elevated insulin levels\" -> \"increased free fatty acids\" -> \"equivalent to blood glucose\" -> \"conflicts with typical ketoacidosis presentation\" -> 60%\n\n### Retrieved Validation Paths:\n- (Diabetes Mellitus)-CAUSES/PREDISPOSES->(Pathogenesis)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Insulin)\n- (Insulin)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Fatty Acids, Nonesterified)\n- (Blood Glucose)-CAUSES->(Diabetes Mellitus, Insulin-Dependent)-COMPLICATES->(Ketosis)\n\n            ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n                \n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n            "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"In diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), there is a significant decrease in insulin levels due to the underlying diabetes mellitus, which leads to an increase in glucagon levels. This results in increased lipolysis, releasing free fatty acids into the bloodstream. The elevated free fatty acids are converted to ketone bodies, leading to ketoacidosis. The glucagon/insulin ratio is increased, and blood glucose levels are also elevated due to insulin deficiency. Therefore, the most accurate option reflecting the biochemical changes in DKA due to diabetes mellitus is 'increased glucagon/insulin ratio, increased cAMP, and increased blood glucose.' The other options either misrepresent the relationship between free fatty acids and blood glucose or incorrectly state the insulin levels. Thus, the best-supported option is 'opa.'\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
