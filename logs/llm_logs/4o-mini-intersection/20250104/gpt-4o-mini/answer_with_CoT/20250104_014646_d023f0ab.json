  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Cholesterol is synthesized in the liver and needs to be transported to peripheral tissues. The primary lipoprotein responsible for this transport is Low-Density Lipoprotein (LDL). While High-Density Lipoprotein (HDL) is involved in reverse cholesterol transport (removing excess cholesterol from tissues), it does not primarily transport cholesterol from the liver to peripheral tissues. Very Low-Density Lipoprotein (VLDL) primarily carries triglycerides and is converted to LDL after triglyceride removal. Chylomicrons are involved in transporting dietary lipids from the intestines, not liver-derived cholesterol. Therefore, the most accurate answer is that LDL is the main transporter of cholesterol from the liver to peripheral tissues.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
