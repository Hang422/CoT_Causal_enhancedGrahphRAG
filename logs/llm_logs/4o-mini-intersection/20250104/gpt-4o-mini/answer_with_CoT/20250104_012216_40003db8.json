Heparin sulfate\nopb. Protamine sulfate\nopc. Low molecular weight heparin\nopd. Warfarin\n\n### Reasoning Chains for Validation:\n- CHAIN: \"Cancer surgery increases risk of venous thromboembolism\" -> \"Prophylaxis is recommended to prevent thromboembolic events\" -> \"Low molecular weight heparin is commonly used for prophylaxis\" -> \"Guidelines support low molecular weight heparin in cancer patients\" -> 95%\n- CHAIN: \"Heparin sulfate is an anticoagulant\" -> \"It is used for immediate anticoagulation\" -> \"Low molecular weight heparin is preferred for prophylaxis\" -> \"Heparin sulfate is not the first choice for prophylaxis\" -> 85%\n- CHAIN: \"Warfarin is an anticoagulant\" -> \"It requires monitoring and has delayed onset\" -> \"Not ideal for immediate prophylaxis post-surgery\" -> \"Low molecular weight heparin is preferred\" -> 90%\n- CHAIN: \"Protamine sulfate is an antidote for heparin\" -> \"It does not have anticoagulant properties\" -> \"Not applicable for prophylaxis\" -> \"Low molecular weight heparin is the choice\" -> 80%\n\n### Retrieved Validation Paths:\n- (Protamine Sulfate)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cells)-INTERACTS_WITH/LOCATION_OF->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Anticoagulants)\n- (Heparin)-INTERACTS_WITH/ISA->(Anticoagulants)\n- (Antidotes)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Anticoagulants)\n- (anticoagulation)-PREVENTS->(Adverse event)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Heparin)\n\n            ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3.

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Cancer surgery significantly increases the risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE), necessitating effective prophylaxis. Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) is the preferred choice for VTE prophylaxis in patients undergoing cancer surgery due to its ease of use, predictable pharmacokinetics, and lower risk of complications compared to unfractionated heparin. Warfarin, while an anticoagulant, is not suitable for immediate postoperative prophylaxis due to its delayed onset and requirement for monitoring. Heparin sulfate is not the first choice for prophylaxis, and protamine sulfate is an antidote for heparin, not an anticoagulant. Therefore, the consensus strongly supports the use of LMWH for this indication.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opc\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
