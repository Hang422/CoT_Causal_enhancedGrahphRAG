  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Secretin is a hormone produced by the S cells in the duodenum in response to acidic chyme entering from the stomach. Its primary physiological role is to stimulate the pancreas to secrete bicarbonate, which neutralizes gastric acid in the small intestine. This action is crucial for creating an optimal pH for digestive enzymes to function effectively. While secretin also has some inhibitory effects on gastric acid secretion and can influence other digestive processes, its most significant and direct action is the stimulation of bicarbonate secretion from the pancreas. Therefore, the most important action of secretin is to increase the secretion of bicarbonates by the pancreas, which aligns with the consensus in physiological literature.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
