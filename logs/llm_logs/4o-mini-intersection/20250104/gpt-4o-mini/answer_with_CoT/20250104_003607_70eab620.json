Acute renal failure\nopb. Development of antiplatelet antibodies\nopc. Encephalitis secondary to liver dysfunction\nopd. Hemorrhagic stroke\n\n### Reasoning Chains for Validation:\n- CHAIN: \"Fibrinolytic drug administration\" -> \"dissolution of thrombus\" -> \"restoration of blood flow\" -> \"risk of bleeding increases\" -> \"hemorrhagic stroke\" -> 85%\n- CHAIN: \"Fibrinolytic therapy\" -> \"increased fibrinogen breakdown\" -> \"potential for systemic bleeding\" -> \"risk of intracranial hemorrhage\" -> \"hemorrhagic stroke\" -> 80%\n- CHAIN: \"Use of fibrinolytics\" -> \"increased risk of bleeding complications\" -> \"possible hemorrhagic events\" -> \"hemorrhagic stroke\" -> 90%\n- CHAIN: \"Fibrinolytic agents\" -> \"altered hemostasis\" -> \"increased bleeding tendency\" -> \"hemorrhagic stroke\" -> 75%\n\n### Retrieved Validation Paths:\n- (Intracranial Hemorrhages)-PREDISPOSES->(Hemorrhagic Stroke)\n- (Hemorrhage)-CAUSES->(Subarachnoid Hemorrhage)-CAUSES->(Hemorrhagic Stroke)\n- (Hemorrhage)-CAUSES->(Disease)-PREDISPOSES->(Hemorrhagic Stroke)\n- (Hemorrhage)-CAUSES->(Cerebral Infarction)-PREDISPOSES->(Hemorrhagic Stroke)\n- (Thrombus)-CAUSES->(Disease)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Blood Circulation)\n- (Thrombus)-CAUSES->(Infection)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Blood Circulation)\n\n            ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3.

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Fibrinolytic drugs, such as tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), are used in the treatment of acute myocardial infarction to dissolve blood clots. While they are effective in restoring blood flow, they significantly increase the risk of bleeding complications due to their mechanism of action, which involves the breakdown of fibrin and other components of the clotting cascade. Among the potential adverse effects, hemorrhagic stroke is a well-documented risk associated with fibrinolytic therapy. This is due to the increased likelihood of intracranial hemorrhage, which can lead to a hemorrhagic stroke. Other options, such as acute renal failure, development of antiplatelet antibodies, and encephalitis secondary to liver dysfunction, are not commonly associated with fibrinolytic therapy. Therefore, the most likely adverse effect to occur when using a fibrinolytic drug for acute myocardial infarction is a hemorrhagic stroke.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
