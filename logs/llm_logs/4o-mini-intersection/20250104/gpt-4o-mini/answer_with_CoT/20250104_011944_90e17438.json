Fever\nopb. Peptic ulcer\nopc. Unstable angina\nopd. Myalgia\n\n### Reasoning Chains for Validation:\n- CHAIN: \"Aspirin\" -> \"inhibits platelet aggregation\" -> \"increased risk of bleeding\" -> \"contraindicated in peptic ulcer\" -> 95%\n- CHAIN: \"Aspirin\" -> \"reduces inflammation\" -> \"may be used in myalgia\" -> \"not contraindicated\" -> 90%\n- CHAIN: \"Aspirin\" -> \"can cause gastrointestinal irritation\" -> \"may worsen peptic ulcer\" -> \"contraindicated in peptic ulcer\" -> 90%\n- CHAIN: \"Aspirin\" -> \"used for cardiovascular protection\" -> \"beneficial in unstable angina\" -> \"not contraindicated\" -> 85%\n- CHAIN: \"Aspirin\" -> \"can cause Reye's syndrome in children\" -> \"contraindicated in fever in children\" -> \"possible contraindication\" -> 70%\n\n### Retrieved Validation Paths:\n- (Aspirin)-TREATS->(Reye Syndrome)\n- (Aspirin)-PREVENTS->(Disease)-CAUSES->(Chloasma)-CAUSES->(Gastrointestinal irritation)\n- (Aspirin)-PREVENTS->(Adverse effects)-CAUSES->(Chloasma)-CAUSES->(Gastrointestinal irritation)\n- (Aspirin)-TREATS->(Dermo-)-CAUSES->(Chloasma)-CAUSES->(Gastrointestinal irritation)\n- (Aspirin)-PREDISPOSES->(Inflammation)\n- (Reye Syndrome)-CAUSES->(hypoglycemia)-CAUSES->(Fever)\n- (Reye Syndrome)-COMPLICATES->(Virus Diseases)-CAUSES->(Fever)\n\n            ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3.

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Aspirin is known to cause gastrointestinal irritation and can exacerbate peptic ulcers, making it contraindicated in patients with active peptic ulcer disease. While aspirin is beneficial in conditions like unstable angina and myalgia, it is not contraindicated in these cases. Additionally, while aspirin can cause Reye's syndrome in children, which is associated with fever, this is a specific concern for pediatric patients rather than a general contraindication for fever in adults. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is that aspirin is contraindicated in peptic ulcer disease due to the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding and irritation.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
