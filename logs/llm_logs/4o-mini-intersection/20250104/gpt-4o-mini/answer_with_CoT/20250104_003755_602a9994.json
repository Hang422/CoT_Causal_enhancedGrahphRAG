  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Propranolol is a non-selective beta-blocker that is commonly used for various conditions, including atrial flutter, thyrotoxicosis, and hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM). In atrial flutter, propranolol helps control heart rate and rhythm. In thyrotoxicosis, it alleviates symptoms such as tachycardia and tremors. HOCM can also benefit from propranolol as it reduces left ventricular outflow obstruction. However, while propranolol can be used for essential tremors, it is not effective for Parkinsonian tremor, which is primarily treated with dopaminergic medications. Therefore, the option that propranolol is not useful for is Parkinsonian tremor.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}",
