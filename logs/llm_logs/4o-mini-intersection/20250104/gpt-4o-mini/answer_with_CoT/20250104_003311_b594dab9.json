  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The management of bleeding esophageal varices is critical in patients with portal hypertension. The primary goal is to control the bleeding and reduce portal pressure. Octreotide, a somatostatin analogue, is well-established in clinical practice for this purpose as it reduces splanchnic blood flow and portal pressure, thereby decreasing the risk of variceal hemorrhage. Ethanolamine oleate is primarily used for sclerotherapy and is not the first-line treatment for acute bleeding. Propranolol is effective for the prevention of variceal bleeding but is not suitable for acute management. Phytonadione (Vitamin K) is used for coagulopathy but does not directly address the bleeding from varices. Therefore, based on the consensus in medical literature, octreotide is the drug of choice for managing bleeding esophageal varices.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
