Imipramine\nopb. Fluvoxamine\nopc. Phenelzine\nopd.

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Imipramine is a tricyclic antidepressant that possesses anticholinergic properties, which can help reduce bladder contractions. This mechanism makes it effective in treating nocturnal enuresis, particularly in children. The other options, including fluvoxamine (an SSRI), phenelzine (an MAOI), and bupropion (an atypical antidepressant), are not typically indicated for nocturnal enuresis and lack the specific properties that would make them effective for this condition. Therefore, based on established pharmacological principles and clinical use, imipramine is the most appropriate choice for treating nocturnal enuresis.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}",
