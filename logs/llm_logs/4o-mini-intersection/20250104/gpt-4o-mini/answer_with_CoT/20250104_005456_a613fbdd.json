  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"To determine which of the listed enzymes is not a marker of the plasma membrane, we analyze each option based on their known locations and functions. 5'-nucleotidase is indeed a plasma membrane enzyme involved in nucleotide metabolism. Adenylyl cyclase is also associated with the plasma membrane, playing a crucial role in the conversion of ATP to cyclic AMP. Na+-K+-ATPase is an integral membrane protein essential for maintaining the electrochemical gradient across the plasma membrane. In contrast, Galactosyl transferase is primarily located in the Golgi apparatus and is involved in glycosylation processes, not directly associated with the plasma membrane. Therefore, Galactosyl transferase is the exception among the listed enzymes. The reasoning chains support this conclusion, indicating that the other three enzymes are indeed markers of the plasma membrane. Thus, the most likely correct answer is Galactosyl transferase as the exception.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}",
