Drug implicated is?\n\n            ### Options\n            opa. Streptomycin\nopb. Isoniazid\nopc. Ethambutol\nopd. Rifampicin\n\n### Reasoning Chains for Validation:\n- CHAIN: \"Anti-tubercular drugs\" -> \"possible side effects\" -> \"ototoxicity\" -> \"deafness and tinnitus\" -> \"Streptomycin\" -> 85%\n- CHAIN: \"Anti-tubercular drugs\" -> \"Isoniazid\" -> \"neuropathy\" -> \"not typically associated with deafness\" -> \"unlikely\" -> 70%\n- CHAIN: \"Anti-tubercular drugs\" -> \"Ethambutol\" -> \"visual disturbances\" -> \"not associated with hearing loss\" -> \"unlikely\" -> 75%\n- CHAIN: \"Anti-tubercular drugs\" -> \"Rifampicin\" -> \"hepatotoxicity\" -> \"not associated with deafness\" -> \"unlikely\" -> 70%\n\n### Retrieved Validation Paths:\n- (Deafness)-COMPLICATES/PREDISPOSES->(Disease)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Virus)-LOCATION_OF->(Streptomycin)\n- (Ethambutol)-CAUSES->(Disorder of the optic nerve)-CAUSES->(Visual alteration)\n- (Tinnitus)-MANIFESTATION_OF/PREDISPOSES->(Disease)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Virus)-LOCATION_OF->(Streptomycin)\n- (isoniazid)-TREATS->(Neuropathy)\n- (Ethambutol)-TREATS->(Disease)-CAUSES->(Visual alteration)\n- (Ethambutol)-TREATS->(Infection)-CAUSES->(Visual alteration)\n\n            ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3.

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The patient is experiencing deafness and tinnitus, which are symptoms indicative of ototoxicity. Among the anti-tubercular drugs listed, Streptomycin is well-known for its potential to cause ototoxicity, leading to hearing loss and tinnitus. Isoniazid is primarily associated with peripheral neuropathy and is not typically linked to hearing issues. Ethambutol is known for causing visual disturbances rather than auditory problems. Rifampicin is associated with hepatotoxicity and does not have a known link to hearing loss. Therefore, the most likely drug implicated in the patient's symptoms is Streptomycin, which aligns with the known side effects of this medication. The reasoning is supported by established pharmacological knowledge regarding the side effects of these drugs.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}",
