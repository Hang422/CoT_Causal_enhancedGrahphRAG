Patient gives history of recurrent bacterial infections. Ophthalmic examination reveals white triangular plaques on conjunctiva. This patient is suffering from deficiency of:\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Vitamin D\nopb. Vitamin B\nopc. Vitamin A\nopd. Vitamin C\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Diminished vision during night\" -> \"possible night blindness\" -> \"associated with Vitamin A deficiency\" -> \"dryness of eyes indicates possible xerophthalmia\" -> \"white triangular plaques on conjunctiva suggest Bitot's spots\" -> \"consistent with Vitamin A deficiency\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Recurrent bacterial infections\" -> \"possible immune dysfunction\" -> \"Vitamin A is important for immune function\" -> \"deficiency may lead to increased infections\" -> \"supports diagnosis of Vitamin A deficiency\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Dryness of eyes\" -> \"xerophthalmia\" -> \"often caused by Vitamin A deficiency\" -> \"white triangular plaques on conjunctiva\" -> \"Bitot's spots indicate Vitamin A deficiency\" -> 92%\nCHAIN: \"40 year old male patient\" -> \"complains of diminished vision\" -> \"suggests possible deficiency\" -> \"dryness of eyes and recurrent infections\" -> \"Vitamin A is crucial for eye health\" -> \"strongly indicates Vitamin A deficiency\" -> 93%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Low Vision)-CAUSES->(Blind Vision)-CAUSES->(Night Blindness)\n(Low Vision)-PREDISPOSES->(Disease)-CAUSES->(Night Blindness)\n(Low Vision)-PREDISPOSES->(Choroidal Neovascularization)-CAUSES->(Night Blindness)\n(Night Blindness)-CAUSES->(Blind Vision)-CAUSES->(Vitamin A Deficiency)\n(Night Blindness)-PREDISPOSES->(Deficiency, Vitamin)-CAUSES->(Vitamin A Deficiency)\n(Night Blindness)-CAUSES->(Anemia)-PREDISPOSES->(Vitamin A Deficiency)\n(Vitamin A Deficiency)-CAUSES->(Disease)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(paracrine)-PROCESS_OF->(Eye)\n(Vitamin A Deficiency)-CAUSES->(Disease)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Hearing)-PROCESS_OF->(Eye)\n(Vitamin A Deficiency)-CAUSES->(Disease)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Neutrophil Infiltration)-PROCESS_OF->(Eye)\n(Xerophthalmia)-CAUSES->(Infection)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Biological Transport, Active)-PROCESS_OF->(conjunctiva)\n(Xerophthalmia)-CAUSES->(Infection)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Blood Circulation)-PROCESS_OF->(conjunctiva)\n(Xerophthalmia)-CAUSES->(Infection)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Immunity)-PROCESS_OF->(conjunctiva)\n(Bacterial Infections)-CAUSES->(Disease)-CAUSES->(Immune System Diseases)\n(Xerophthalmia)-CAUSES->(Vitamin A Deficiency)\n(Vitamin A Deficiency)-CAUSES->(Disease)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(drug clearance)-PROCESS_OF->(conjunctiva)\n(Vitamin A Deficiency)-CAUSES->(Disease)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Immunity)-PROCESS_OF->(conjunctiva)\n(Vitamin A Deficiency)-CAUSES->(Disease)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(physiological aspects)-PROCESS_OF->(conjunctiva)\n(Vitamin A)-TREATS->(Vitamin A Deficiency)\n(Eye health)-CAUSES->(Blind Vision)-CAUSES->(Vitamin A Deficiency)\n(Eye health)-PREDISPOSES->(Diabetes)-CAUSES->(Vitamin A Deficiency)\n(Eye)-PART_OF->(conjunctiva)\n(conjunctiva)-LOCATION_OF->(Vitamin A Deficiency)\n(Immune System Diseases)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Virus)-LOCATION_OF->(CD4 gene|CD4)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Vitamin A)\n(Immune System Diseases)-COMPLICATES->(Disease)-PREDISPOSES->(Liver Dysfunction)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Vitamin A)\n(Eye)-LOCATION_OF->(Xerophthalmia)\n(conjunctiva)-LOCATION_OF->(Vitamin A Deficiency)\n(Eye)-LOCATION_OF->(Vitamin A)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"The patient's symptoms of diminished vision during night (night blindness), dryness of eyes (xerophthalmia), and recurrent bacterial infections strongly indicate a deficiency of Vitamin A. Night blindness is a classic sign of Vitamin A deficiency, as this vitamin is crucial for the synthesis of rhodopsin, a pigment in the retina that is essential for low-light vision. Xerophthalmia, characterized by dryness of the conjunctiva and cornea, is also associated with Vitamin A deficiency and can lead to the formation of Bitot's spots, which are white triangular plaques on the conjunctiva. Furthermore, Vitamin A plays a vital role in maintaining immune function, and its deficiency can lead to increased susceptibility to infections. Therefore, the evidence supports that the patient is suffering from Vitamin A deficiency.\"\n}",
