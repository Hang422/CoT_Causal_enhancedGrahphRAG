      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Biochemistry.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Hypermagnesemia may be observed in:\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Hyperparathyroidism\nopb. Diabetes mellitus\nopc. Kwashiorkor\nopd. Primary aldosteronism\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Hyperparathyroidism\" -> \"increased bone resorption\" -> \"release of magnesium from bones\" -> \"elevated serum magnesium levels\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Diabetes mellitus\" -> \"possible renal impairment\" -> \"decreased magnesium excretion\" -> \"potential for hypermagnesemia\" -> 70%\nCHAIN: \"Kwashiorkor\" -> \"malnutrition\" -> \"possible electrolyte imbalances\" -> \"unclear relationship with magnesium levels\" -> 50%\nCHAIN: \"Primary aldosteronism\" -> \"increased aldosterone secretion\" -> \"increased renal excretion of magnesium\" -> \"decreased serum magnesium levels\" -> 90%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Diabetes Mellitus)-CAUSES->(Renal Insufficiency)\n(Kwashiorkor)-CAUSES->(Malnutrition)\n(Malnutrition)-COMPLICATES->(Disease)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Hopping)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Electrolytes)\n(Malnutrition)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Disease)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Hopping)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Electrolytes)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Hypermagnesemia is characterized by elevated serum magnesium levels, which can occur in specific conditions. In hyperparathyroidism, increased bone resorption leads to the release of magnesium from bones, potentially causing hypermagnesemia. In diabetes mellitus, renal impairment can decrease magnesium excretion, which may contribute to hypermagnesemia, although this is less common. Kwashiorkor, a form of malnutrition, can lead to electrolyte imbalances, but its direct relationship with magnesium levels is unclear and not typically associated with hypermagnesemia. In contrast, primary aldosteronism is associated with increased aldosterone secretion, which promotes renal excretion of magnesium, leading to decreased serum magnesium levels, thus contradicting hypermagnesemia. Therefore, the most relevant conditions for hypermagnesemia are hyperparathyroidism and potentially diabetes mellitus, while kwashiorkor's relationship is uncertain and primary aldosteronism is not associated with hypermagnesemia.\"\n}",
