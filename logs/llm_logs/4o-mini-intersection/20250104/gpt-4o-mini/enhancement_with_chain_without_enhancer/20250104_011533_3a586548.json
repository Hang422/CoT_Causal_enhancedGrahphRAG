digested in the mouth\" -> \"Disaccharides reach the small intestine\" -> \"Enzymes like maltase, sucrase, and lactase act on disaccharides\" -> \"Disaccharides are broken down into monosaccharides\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Disaccharides are consumed\" -> \"They pass through the stomach\" -> \"Stomach acid does not digest disaccharides\" -> \"Disaccharides enter the small intestine\" -> \"Pancreatic enzymes further assist in digestion\" -> \"Final digestion occurs in the small intestine\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Disaccharides are ingested\" -> \"They travel through the esophagus\" -> \"They reach the stomach\" -> \"Stomach does not digest disaccharides\" -> \"Disaccharides move to the small intestine\" -> \"Specific enzymes in the small intestine digest disaccharides\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Disaccharides are consumed\" -> \"They enter the digestive tract\" -> \"They reach the stomach\" -> \"No significant digestion occurs in the stomach\" -> \"Disaccharides arrive in the small intestine\" -> \"Digestion of disaccharides occurs primarily in the small intestine\" -> 90%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but

Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Digestion of disaccharides primarily occurs in the small intestine. While salivary amylase in the mouth begins the breakdown of carbohydrates, it does not fully digest disaccharides. In the stomach, no significant digestion of disaccharides occurs due to the acidic environment. The majority of disaccharide digestion is completed in the small intestine, where specific enzymes such as maltase, sucrase, and lactase act to break them down into monosaccharides. This aligns with the consensus that the small intestine is the main site for disaccharide digestion.\"\n}",
