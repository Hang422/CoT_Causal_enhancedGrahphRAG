      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Pulmonary fibrosis is a complication of: March 2011, March 2012, September 2012, March 2013\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Methotrexate\nopb. Doxorubicin\nopc. Cisplatin\nopd. Busulfan\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Methotrexate\" -> \"known to cause pulmonary toxicity\" -> \"can lead to pulmonary fibrosis\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Doxorubicin\" -> \"associated with various pulmonary complications\" -> \"less commonly linked to pulmonary fibrosis\" -> 70%\nCHAIN: \"Cisplatin\" -> \"can cause lung toxicity\" -> \"not typically associated with pulmonary fibrosis\" -> 60%\nCHAIN: \"Busulfan\" -> \"known to cause pulmonary toxicity\" -> \"can lead to pulmonary fibrosis\" -> 80%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Methotrexate)-CAUSES->(Immunity)-PROCESS_OF->(Lung)\n(Complication)-CAUSES->(Pulmonary Fibrosis)\n(Cisplatin)-CAUSES->(Biological Transport, Active)-PROCESS_OF->(Lung)\n(Busulfan)-CAUSES->(Graft acceptance)-PROCESS_OF->(Lung)\n(Lung)-LOCATION_OF->(Pulmonary Fibrosis)\n(Lung)-LOCATION_OF->(Pulmonary Fibrosis)\n(Lung)-LOCATION_OF->(Pulmonary Fibrosis)\n(Lung)-LOCATION_OF->(Pulmonary Fibrosis)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Methotrexate is known to cause pulmonary toxicity and can lead to pulmonary fibrosis, making it a significant concern in patients receiving this medication. Doxorubicin is associated with various pulmonary complications but is less commonly linked to pulmonary fibrosis, indicating a lower risk. Cisplatin can cause lung toxicity but is not typically associated with pulmonary fibrosis, suggesting minimal relevance. Busulfan is also known to cause pulmonary toxicity and can lead to pulmonary fibrosis, similar to methotrexate. Therefore, the options most strongly associated with pulmonary fibrosis are Methotrexate and Busulfan.\"\n}",
