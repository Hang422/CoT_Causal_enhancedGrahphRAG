Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        All are TRUE about protease activated receptors, EXCEPT:\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Family of three seven transmembrane protein\nopb. Activated by thrombin\nopc. Releases PGE2\nopd. Protects epithelial cells\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Protease activated receptors (PARs) are a family of G protein-coupled receptors\" -> \"They consist of three main types: PAR1, PAR2, and PAR3\" -> \"Each type has seven transmembrane domains\" -> \"Therefore, the statement about being a family of three seven transmembrane proteins is TRUE\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Protease activated receptors are activated by proteolytic cleavage\" -> \"Thrombin is a well-known activator of PAR1\" -> \"This activation leads to various cellular responses\" -> \"Thus, the statement about being activated by thrombin is TRUE\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Protease activated receptors can influence the release of various mediators\" -> \"PGE2 is a prostaglandin involved in inflammation\" -> \"However, PARs primarily activate pathways leading to thromboxane and other mediators\" -> \"The direct release of PGE2 is not a primary function of PARs\" -> \"Therefore, the statement about releasing PGE2 is likely FALSE\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Protease activated receptors play a role in cell signaling\" -> \"They can influence protective mechanisms in epithelial cells\" -> \"However, their primary role is not solely protective\" -> \"The statement about protecting epithelial cells is somewhat ambiguous\" -> \"Thus, it may not be entirely accurate\" -> 80%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Receptors, Proteinase-Activated)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cells)-LOCATION_OF->(Thrombin)\n(Receptors, Proteinase-Activated)-INTERACTS_WITH->(mast cell)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Thrombin)\n(Receptors, Proteinase-Activated)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cells)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Prostaglandins)\n(Receptors, Proteinase-Activated)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cells)-LOCATION_OF->(Prostaglandins)\n(Prostaglandins)-TREATS->(Pathogenesis)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)\n(Prostaglandins)-PREVENTS->(Ulcer)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)\n(Inflammation)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Pathogenesis)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)\n(Inflammation)-COMPLICATES->(Ulcer)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)\n(Dinoprostone)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cells)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)\n(Dinoprostone)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Pathogenesis)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)\n(Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cells)-LOCATION_OF->(Dinoprostone)\n(Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cells)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Dinoprostone)\n(Dinoprostone)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cells)-PART_OF->(Smooth muscle (tissue))-LOCATION_OF->(Release - action)\n(Dinoprostone)-PART_OF->(Cells)-PART_OF->(Tissue fiber)-LOCATION_OF->(Release - action)\n(Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cells)-PART_OF->(Smooth muscle (tissue))-LOCATION_OF->(Release - action)\n(Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cells)-PART_OF->(Tissue fiber)-LOCATION_OF->(Release - action)\n(Receptors, Proteinase-Activated)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Epithelial Cells)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Protease activated receptors (PARs) are indeed a family of G protein-coupled receptors, specifically consisting of three main types: PAR1, PAR2, and PAR3, each with seven transmembrane domains, confirming that the statement about being a family of three seven transmembrane proteins is TRUE. PARs are activated by proteolytic cleavage, with thrombin being a well-known activator of PAR1, thus the statement about being activated by thrombin is also TRUE. While PARs can influence the release of various mediators, they primarily activate pathways leading to thromboxane and other mediators rather than directly releasing PGE2, making the statement about releasing PGE2 likely FALSE. Lastly, while PARs can influence protective mechanisms in epithelial cells, their primary role is not solely protective, making the statement about protecting epithelial cells somewhat ambiguous and not entirely accurate. Therefore, the option that is NOT TRUE is the one regarding the release of PGE2.\"\n}",
