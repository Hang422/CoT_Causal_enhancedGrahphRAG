      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Asprin is not given in a patient who is already on heparin because aspirin causes :\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Platelet dysfunction\nopb. Aspirin inhibits the action of heparin\nopc. Enhanced hypersensitivity of heparin\nopd. Therapy of heparin cannot be monitored\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Aspirin is an antiplatelet agent\" -> \"inhibits platelet aggregation\" -> \"increased risk of bleeding\" -> \"complicates heparin therapy\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Aspirin affects platelet function\" -> \"causes platelet dysfunction\" -> \"increased bleeding risk\" -> \"not advisable with heparin\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Heparin is an anticoagulant\" -> \"works by inhibiting clotting factors\" -> \"aspirin also affects clotting\" -> \"potential for increased bleeding\" -> 80%\nCHAIN: \"Aspirin and heparin both affect hemostasis\" -> \"aspirin can lead to platelet dysfunction\" -> \"may interfere with heparin's efficacy\" -> \"increased risk of adverse effects\" -> 75%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Aspirin)-CAUSES->(Thrombocytopenia)-PREDISPOSES->(platelet dysfunction)\n(Aspirin)-TREATS->(Virus Diseases)-CAUSES->(platelet dysfunction)\n(Aspirin)-TREATS->(COVID-19)-CAUSES->(platelet dysfunction)\n(Aspirin)-PREDISPOSES->(Hemorrhage)\n(Heparin)-CAUSES->(Thrombocytopenia)-PREDISPOSES->(platelet dysfunction)\n(Heparin)-PREVENTS->(Virus)-CAUSES->(platelet dysfunction)\n(Heparin)-PREVENTS->(Virus Diseases)-CAUSES->(platelet dysfunction)\n(Aspirin)-CAUSES->(Thrombocytopenia)-PREDISPOSES->(platelet dysfunction)\n(Aspirin)-TREATS->(Virus Diseases)-CAUSES->(platelet dysfunction)\n(Aspirin)-TREATS->(COVID-19)-CAUSES->(platelet dysfunction)\n(Hemorrhage)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Genes)-PART_OF->(Blood)-LOCATION_OF->(Heparin therapy)\n(Hemorrhage)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(TNFRSF10B gene|TNFRSF10B)-PART_OF->(Blood)-LOCATION_OF->(Heparin therapy)\n(Anticoagulants)-PREDISPOSES->(Pathogenesis)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Blood Coagulation Factor)\n(Anticoagulants)-TREATS->(Pathogenesis)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Blood Coagulation Factor)\n(Heparin)-TREATS->(Pathogenesis)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Blood Coagulation Factor)\n(Heparin)-PREVENTS->(Inflammation)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Blood Coagulation Factor)\n(Blood Coagulation Factor)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cells)-LOCATION_OF->(Aspirin)\n(Blood Coagulation Factor)-INTERACTS_WITH->([M]Unspecified tumor cell NOS)-LOCATION_OF->(Aspirin)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Aspirin is an antiplatelet agent that inhibits platelet aggregation, leading to increased risk of bleeding. This effect complicates the management of patients on heparin, which is an anticoagulant that also affects hemostasis. The combination of aspirin and heparin can lead to enhanced bleeding risks due to their overlapping effects on platelet function and coagulation pathways. Therefore, aspirin is not advisable in patients already receiving heparin therapy. The reasoning aligns with the consensus that both medications can predispose patients to hemorrhage, making their concurrent use potentially dangerous.\"\n}",
