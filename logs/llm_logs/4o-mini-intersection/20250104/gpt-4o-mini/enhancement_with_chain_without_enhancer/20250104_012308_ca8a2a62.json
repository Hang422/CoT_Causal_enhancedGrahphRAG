      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Biochemistry.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4.

Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"1. HDL increases oxidation of LDL: This statement is false. HDL is known to promote reverse cholesterol transport and does not directly increase the oxidation of LDL. 2. HDL reduces foam cell production by LDL: This statement is true. HDL helps to remove excess cholesterol from macrophages, thereby reducing foam cell formation. 3. HDL is the best predictor of CAD: This statement is false. CAD risk is influenced by multiple factors, including LDL levels and triglycerides; HDL alone is not the best predictor. 4. HDL helps to clear lipids from atheromas: This statement is true. HDL facilitates the removal of cholesterol from arterial walls, which can reduce atheroma size. Therefore, the false statements are 'HDL increases oxidation of LDL' and 'HDL is the best predictor of CAD.'\"\n}",
