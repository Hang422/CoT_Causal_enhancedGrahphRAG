      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Which of the following is not an action of epinephrine when administered intravenously in a high dose?\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Increases liver glycogenolysis\nopb. Causes broachiolar constriction\nopc. Evokes extrasystoles in the heart\nopd. Produces restlessness and anxiety\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Epinephrine administered intravenously\" -> \"stimulates beta-adrenergic receptors\" -> \"increases heart rate and contractility\" -> \"evokes extrasystoles in the heart\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Epinephrine administered intravenously\" -> \"stimulates alpha-adrenergic receptors\" -> \"increases liver glycogenolysis\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Epinephrine administered intravenously\" -> \"stimulates beta-2 adrenergic receptors\" -> \"causes bronchodilation\" -> \"possible confusion with bronchiolar constriction\" -> 70%\nCHAIN: \"Epinephrine administered intravenously\" -> \"activates the central nervous system\" -> \"produces restlessness and anxiety\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Epinephrine administered intravenously\" -> \"causes vasoconstriction\" -> \"increases blood pressure\" -> \"not related to bronchiolar constriction\" -> 85%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Epinephrine)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cells)-INTERACTS_WITH->(beta-adrenergic receptor)\n(Epinephrine)-CAUSES->(Tachycardia)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(beta-adrenergic receptor)\n(Epinephrine)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cells)-INTERACTS_WITH->(alpha-adrenergic receptor)\n(Epinephrine)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Pathogenesis)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(alpha-adrenergic receptor)\n(Epinephrine)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cells)-INTERACTS_WITH->(beta-2 Adrenergic Receptors)\n(Epinephrine)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Pathogenesis)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(beta-2 Adrenergic Receptors)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Epinephrine, when administered intravenously in high doses, primarily stimulates beta-adrenergic receptors, leading to increased heart rate and contractility, which can evoke extrasystoles in the heart. It also stimulates alpha-adrenergic receptors, resulting in increased liver glycogenolysis. Importantly, epinephrine stimulates beta-2 adrenergic receptors, causing bronchodilation, not bronchiolar constriction. Additionally, it activates the central nervous system, which can produce restlessness and anxiety. Therefore, the action that is not associated with high-dose epinephrine is 'causes bronchiolar constriction,' as it actually causes bronchodilation. Thus, the correct answer is option 'opb.'\"\n}",
