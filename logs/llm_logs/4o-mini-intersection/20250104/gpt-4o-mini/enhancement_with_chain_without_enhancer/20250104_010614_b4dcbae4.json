      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Physiology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        The only Sugar normaly absorbed in the intestine against a concentration gradient is :\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Xylose\nopb. Mannose\nopc. Glucose\nopd. Ribose\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Glucose\" -> \"actively transported in the intestine\" -> \"against concentration gradient\" -> \"most common sugar absorbed\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Xylose\" -> \"absorbed passively\" -> \"not against concentration gradient\" -> \"less common in diet\" -> 80%\nCHAIN: \"Mannose\" -> \"absorbed via specific transporters\" -> \"not primarily against concentration gradient\" -> \"less significant in human metabolism\" -> 75%\nCHAIN: \"Ribose\" -> \"not primarily absorbed in the intestine\" -> \"limited dietary sources\" -> \"not a major sugar\" -> 70%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Glucose)-CAUSES->(Intestinal Metabolism)-PROCESS_OF->(Intestines)\n(Glucose)-CAUSES->(paracrine)-PROCESS_OF->(Intestines)\n(Glucose)-CAUSES->(Respiration)-PROCESS_OF->(Intestines)\n(Ribose)-TREATS->(Staphylococcus epidermidis)-CAUSES->(Disease)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Biological feedback)-PROCESS_OF->(Intestines)\n(Ribose)-TREATS->(Staphylococcus epidermidis)-CAUSES->(Disease)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(metabolic effects)-PROCESS_OF->(Intestines)\n(Ribose)-TREATS->(Staphylococcus epidermidis)-CAUSES->(Disease)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Neutrophil Infiltration)-PROCESS_OF->(Intestines)\n(Mannose)-TREATS->(Fibrosis)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Membrane Transport Proteins)\n(Mannose)-PART_OF->(Renal Cell)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Membrane Transport Proteins)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Glucose is the only sugar normally absorbed in the intestine against a concentration gradient through active transport mechanisms, primarily via the sodium-glucose co-transporter (SGLT1). This process allows for efficient absorption even when luminal glucose concentrations are low. In contrast, xylose is absorbed passively and does not require energy, thus not against a concentration gradient. Mannose is also absorbed via specific transporters but primarily does not operate against a concentration gradient. Ribose is not significantly absorbed in the intestine and has limited dietary sources. Therefore, the correct answer is glucose, supported by its established role in intestinal absorption mechanisms.\"\n}",
