      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Which of the following drugs is useful in prophylaxis of motion sickness?\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Hyoscine\nopb. Metoclopramide\nopc. Prochlorperazine\nopd. Ondansetron\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Hyoscine\" -> \"anticholinergic properties\" -> \"prevention of nausea and vomiting\" -> \"useful in motion sickness prophylaxis\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Metoclopramide\" -> \"dopamine antagonist\" -> \"increases gastric motility\" -> \"not primarily used for motion sickness\" -> 70%\nCHAIN: \"Prochlorperazine\" -> \"antipsychotic with antiemetic effects\" -> \"used for nausea and vomiting\" -> \"not first-line for motion sickness\" -> 75%\nCHAIN: \"Ondansetron\" -> \"serotonin receptor antagonist\" -> \"effective for chemotherapy-induced nausea\" -> \"not typically used for motion sickness\" -> 65%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Anticholinergic Agents)-CAUSES->(Symptoms)-CAUSES->([D]Nausea and vomiting NOS)\n(Anticholinergic Agents)-TREATS->(Motion Sickness)-CAUSES->([D]Nausea and vomiting NOS)\n(Anticholinergic Agents)-PREVENTS->(Vomiting)-CAUSES->([D]Nausea and vomiting NOS)\n([D]Nausea and vomiting NOS)-CAUSES->(Gastrointestinal symptoms NOS)-CAUSES->(Motion Sickness)\n([D]Nausea and vomiting NOS)-CAUSES->(Vomiting)-CAUSES->(Motion Sickness)\n(Prophylactic treatment)-CAUSES->(Adverse effects)-CAUSES->(Motion Sickness)\n(Prophylactic treatment)-PREDISPOSES->(Symptoms)-CAUSES->(Motion Sickness)\n(Prophylactic treatment)-PREDISPOSES->(Teratogenesis)-CAUSES->(Motion Sickness)\n(Prochlorperazine)-TREATS->(Adverse effects)-CAUSES->(Malnutrition)-PREDISPOSES->(Pica Disease)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Antiemetic Effect)\n(Prochlorperazine)-TREATS->(Adverse effects)-CAUSES->(Iron deficiency anemia)-PREDISPOSES->(Pica Disease)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Antiemetic Effect)\n(Prochlorperazine)-TREATS->(Symptoms)-CAUSES->(Malnutrition)-PREDISPOSES->(Pica Disease)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Antiemetic Effect)\n(Antipsychotic Agents)-PREVENTS->([D]Nausea and vomiting NOS)\n([D]Nausea and vomiting NOS)-CAUSES->(Gastrointestinal symptoms NOS)-CAUSES->(Motion Sickness)\n([D]Nausea and vomiting NOS)-CAUSES->(Vomiting)-CAUSES->(Motion Sickness)\n(Scopolamine)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Anticholinergic Agents)\n(Metoclopramide)-TREATS->(Functional disorder)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(physiological aspects)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Dopamine Antagonists)\n(Metoclopramide)-TREATS->(Epilepsy)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(physiological aspects)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Dopamine Antagonists)\n(Antiemetic Effect)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-CAUSES->([D]Nausea and vomiting NOS)\n(Antiemetic Effect)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-TREATS->([D]Nausea and vomiting NOS)\n(Ondansetron)-TREATS->(Disease)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Sleep, Slow-Wave)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Serotonin Antagonists)\n(Ondansetron)-ISA->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Serotonin Uptake Inhibitors)-ISA->(Serotonin Antagonists)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Hyoscine (scopolamine) is an anticholinergic agent that is well-established for the prophylaxis of motion sickness due to its ability to prevent nausea and vomiting associated with vestibular disturbances. Metoclopramide, while a dopamine antagonist that increases gastric motility, is not primarily indicated for motion sickness and is more commonly used for gastrointestinal disorders. Prochlorperazine is an antipsychotic with antiemetic properties but is not considered a first-line treatment for motion sickness. Ondansetron, a serotonin receptor antagonist, is effective for chemotherapy-induced nausea but is not typically used for motion sickness. Therefore, the most appropriate drug for motion sickness prophylaxis is hyoscine.\"\n}",
