      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Which among the following drug is contra-indicated in renal failure?\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Pethidine\nopb. Morphine\nopc. Fentanyl\nopd. Atracurium\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Pethidine\" -> \"metabolized to normeperidine\" -> \"normeperidine accumulation in renal failure\" -> \"increased risk of seizures\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Morphine\" -> \"metabolized to active metabolites\" -> \"accumulation of metabolites in renal failure\" -> \"increased risk of respiratory depression\" -> 80%\nCHAIN: \"Fentanyl\" -> \"primarily metabolized by the liver\" -> \"minimal renal excretion\" -> \"generally safe in renal failure\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Atracurium\" -> \"metabolized by non-specific plasma esterases\" -> \"also undergoes spontaneous degradation\" -> \"not contraindicated in renal failure\" -> 95%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(normeperidine)-TREATS->(Kidney Failure)\n(normeperidine)-TREATS->(Renal Insufficiency)-CAUSES->(Seizures)\n(Kidney Failure)-CAUSES->(Disease)-CAUSES->(Seizures)\n(Kidney Failure)-CAUSES->(Infection)-CAUSES->(Seizures)\n(Kidney Failure)-CAUSES->(Hypertensive disease)-CAUSES->(Seizures)\n(Kidney Failure)-CAUSES->(Infection)-CAUSES->(Respiratory Depression)\n(Kidney Failure)-CAUSES->(hypoglycemia)-CAUSES->(Respiratory Depression)\n(Kidney Failure)-CAUSES->(Pulmonary Edema)-CAUSES->(Respiratory Depression)\n(Fentanyl)-TREATS->(Disease)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(drug clearance)-PROCESS_OF->(Liver)\n(Fentanyl)-TREATS->(Disease)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Thermotolerance)-PROCESS_OF->(Liver)\n(Fentanyl)-TREATS->(Disease)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(biological adaptation to stress)-PROCESS_OF->(Liver)\n(Meperidine)-ISA->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(CYP2C19 gene|CYP2C19)-INTERACTS_WITH->(normeperidine)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Pethidine is contraindicated in renal failure due to its metabolism to normeperidine, which can accumulate and increase the risk of seizures. Morphine is also problematic in renal failure as its active metabolites can accumulate, leading to respiratory depression. Fentanyl, primarily metabolized by the liver with minimal renal excretion, is generally considered safe in renal failure. Atracurium is not contraindicated as it is metabolized by non-specific plasma esterases and undergoes spontaneous degradation, making it safe for use in patients with renal impairment.\"\n}",
