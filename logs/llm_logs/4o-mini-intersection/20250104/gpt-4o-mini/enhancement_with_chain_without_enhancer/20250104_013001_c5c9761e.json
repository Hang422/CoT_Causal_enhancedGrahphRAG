      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Which of the following beta adrenergic agonist is used as an aerosol for treatment of bronchial asthma?\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Salbutamol\nopb. Ketotifen\nopc. Fluticasone\nopd. Monteleukast\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Salbutamol\" -> \"beta adrenergic agonist\" -> \"bronchodilation\" -> \"used in aerosol form\" -> \"effective for bronchial asthma\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Ketotifen\" -> \"antihistamine\" -> \"not a beta adrenergic agonist\" -> \"not used for bronchial asthma\" -> 10%\nCHAIN: \"Fluticasone\" -> \"corticosteroid\" -> \"anti-inflammatory\" -> \"not a beta adrenergic agonist\" -> \"not used as aerosol for bronchial asthma\" -> 15%\nCHAIN: \"Montelukast\" -> \"leukotriene receptor antagonist\" -> \"not a beta adrenergic agonist\" -> \"not used as aerosol for bronchial asthma\" -> 10%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Adrenergic beta-Agonists)-TREATS->(Asthma)\n(Adrenergic beta-Agonists)-TREATS->(Asthma)\n(Adrenergic beta-Agonists)-TREATS->(Asthma)\n(Albuterol)-ISA->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Adrenergic beta-Agonists)\n(Albuterol)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Adrenergic beta-Agonists)\n(Ketotifen)-ISA->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Preservative free ingredient)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Histamine Antagonists)\n(Ketotifen)-ISA->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Sedatives)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Histamine Antagonists)\n(Histamine Antagonists)-ISA->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Adrenergic beta-Agonists)\n(Histamine Antagonists)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Stimulant)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Adrenergic beta-Agonists)\n(fluticasone)-ISA->(Adrenal Cortex Hormones)\n(Adrenal Cortex Hormones)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Anti-Inflammatory Agents)\n(Anti-Inflammatory Agents)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Adrenergic beta-Agonists)\n(Anti-Inflammatory Agents)-INTERACTS_WITH->(agonists)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Adrenergic beta-Agonists)\n(Leukotriene Antagonists)-ISA->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Adrenergic beta-Agonists)\n(Leukotriene Antagonists)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Anti-Asthmatic Agents)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Adrenergic beta-Agonists)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Salbutamol is a beta adrenergic agonist that is commonly used as an aerosol for the treatment of bronchial asthma due to its bronchodilatory effects. The reasoning chain for Salbutamol is correct and aligns with consensus, confirming its effectiveness in asthma management. Ketotifen is an antihistamine and not a beta adrenergic agonist, thus it is not used for asthma treatment. Fluticasone is a corticosteroid with anti-inflammatory properties but is not a beta adrenergic agonist and is not used as an aerosol for asthma. Montelukast is a leukotriene receptor antagonist and also not a beta adrenergic agonist, making it unsuitable for aerosol use in asthma. Therefore, the only correct option for aerosol treatment of bronchial asthma is Salbutamol.\"\n}",
