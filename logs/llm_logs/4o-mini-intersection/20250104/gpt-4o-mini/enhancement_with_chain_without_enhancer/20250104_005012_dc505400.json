      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Antidepressant drug that can be used in nocturnal enuresis is?\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Imipramine\nopb. Fluvoxamine\nopc. Phenelzine\nopd. Bupropion\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Imipramine\" -> \"tricyclic antidepressant\" -> \"anticholinergic properties\" -> \"reduces bladder contractions\" -> \"used for nocturnal enuresis\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Fluvoxamine\" -> \"SSRI\" -> \"not typically used for nocturnal enuresis\" -> \"less effective for this condition\" -> 60%\nCHAIN: \"Phenelzine\" -> \"MAOI\" -> \"not indicated for nocturnal enuresis\" -> \"less relevant for this condition\" -> 50%\nCHAIN: \"Bupropion\" -> \"atypical antidepressant\" -> \"not indicated for nocturnal enuresis\" -> \"less effective for this condition\" -> 50%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Anticholinergic Agents)-COMPLICATES->(Disease)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(paracrine)-PROCESS_OF->(Bladder)\n(Anticholinergic Agents)-COMPLICATES->(Disease)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Respiration)-PROCESS_OF->(Bladder)\n(Anticholinergic Agents)-COMPLICATES->(Disease)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Physiologic Function)-PROCESS_OF->(Bladder)\n(Contraction)-PREDISPOSES->(Bedwetting)\n(Antidepressive Agents)-CAUSES->(Disease)-CAUSES->(Bedwetting)\n(Antidepressive Agents)-CAUSES->(Incontinence)-PREDISPOSES->(Bedwetting)\n(Antidepressive Agents)-TREATS->(imbalance)-CAUSES->(Bedwetting)\n(Imipramine)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Antidepressive Agents)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Antidepressive Agents, Tricyclic)\n(Imipramine)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Antipsychotic Agents)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Antidepressive Agents, Tricyclic)\n(Antidepressive Agents, Tricyclic)-ISA->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Anticholinergic Agents)\n(Antidepressive Agents, Tricyclic)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Anticholinergic Agents)\n(Bladder)-LOCATION_OF->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-CAUSES->(Bedwetting)\n(Bladder)-LOCATION_OF->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-TREATS->(Bedwetting)\n(Bupropion)-ISA->(Antidepressive Agents)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Imipramine is a tricyclic antidepressant known for its anticholinergic properties, which can reduce bladder contractions, making it effective for treating nocturnal enuresis. This aligns with consensus that supports its use in this condition. In contrast, fluvoxamine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), is not typically used for nocturnal enuresis and is less effective for this condition. Phenelzine, a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI), is also not indicated for nocturnal enuresis, and bupropion, an atypical antidepressant, is similarly not indicated for this condition. Therefore, the best-supported option for treating nocturnal enuresis is imipramine.\"\n}",
