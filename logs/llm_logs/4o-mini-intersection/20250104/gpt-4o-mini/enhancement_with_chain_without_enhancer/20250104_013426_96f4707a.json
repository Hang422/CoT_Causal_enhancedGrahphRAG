      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Use of tamoxifen for breast cancer can cause all ofthe following adverse effects, exceptaEUR'\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. >Thromboembolism\nopb. Endometrial carcinoma\nopc. >Carcinoma in contralateral breast\nopd. >Cataract\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Tamoxifen use\" -> \"increased risk of thromboembolism\" -> \"known adverse effect\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Tamoxifen use\" -> \"increased risk of endometrial carcinoma\" -> \"documented adverse effect\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Tamoxifen use\" -> \"increased risk of carcinoma in contralateral breast\" -> \"possible adverse effect\" -> 80%\nCHAIN: \"Tamoxifen use\" -> \"risk of cataract development\" -> \"less commonly associated adverse effect\" -> 70%\nCHAIN: \"Tamoxifen use\" -> \"adverse effects include thromboembolism, endometrial carcinoma, and carcinoma in contralateral breast\" -> \"cataract is less commonly linked\" -> 85%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Tamoxifen)-PREDISPOSES->(Thromboembolism)\n(Thromboembolism)-CAUSES->(Disease)-CAUSES->(Adverse reactions)\n(Thromboembolism)-COMPLICATES->(COVID-19)-CAUSES->(Adverse reactions)\n(Thromboembolism)-CAUSES->(Obesity)-PREDISPOSES->(Adverse reactions)\n(Tamoxifen)-PREDISPOSES->(Thromboembolism)\n(Thromboembolism)-CAUSES->(Disease)-CAUSES->(Cataract)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Tamoxifen is associated with several adverse effects. It is well-documented that tamoxifen increases the risk of thromboembolism, which is a known adverse effect (CHAIN: 95%). Additionally, there is a recognized increased risk of endometrial carcinoma in women taking tamoxifen (CHAIN: 90%). The risk of carcinoma in the contralateral breast is less clear; while some studies suggest a possible association, it is not as strongly established as the other effects (CHAIN: 80%). Cataract development is also noted as a less commonly associated adverse effect (CHAIN: 70%). Therefore, the most accurate conclusion is that while thromboembolism, endometrial carcinoma, and cataracts are recognized adverse effects, carcinoma in the contralateral breast is less definitively linked to tamoxifen use, making it the exception among the listed options.\"\n}",
