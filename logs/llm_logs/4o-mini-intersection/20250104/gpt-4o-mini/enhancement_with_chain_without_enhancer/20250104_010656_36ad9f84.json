      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4.

Vidarabine\nopc. Ganciclovir\nopd. Amantadine\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Herpes simplex encephalitis\" -> \"commonly treated with antiviral medications\" -> \"Acyclovir is a first-line treatment\" -> \"Vidarabine is also used but less commonly\" -> \"Ganciclovir is primarily for cytomegalovirus\" -> \"Amantadine is not indicated for herpes simplex\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Herpes simplex virus\" -> \"causes encephalitis\" -> \"Acyclovir is effective against it\" -> \"Vidarabine is an alternative option\" -> \"Ganciclovir is not typically used for herpes simplex\" -> \"Amantadine is an antiviral for influenza\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Herpes simplex encephalitis\" -> \"requires antiviral therapy\" -> \"Acyclovir is standard treatment\" -> \"Vidarabine is an option but less preferred\" -> \"Ganciclovir is not effective for herpes simplex\" -> \"Amantadine is unrelated to herpes treatment\" -> 80%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Simplexvirus)-CAUSES->(Encephalitis)\n(Vidarabine)-TREATS->(Herpes Simplex Infections)\n(Vidarabine)-TREATS->(Herpes Simplex Infections)\n(Treated with)-TREATS->(Atherosclerosis)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Genes)-PART_OF->(Mucous Membrane)-LOCATION_OF->(First line treatment)\n(Treated with)-TREATS->(Atherosclerosis)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Genes)-PART_OF->(Skeletal muscle structure)-LOCATION_OF->(First line treatment)\n(First line treatment)-TREATS->(Herpesvirus 2, Human)-LOCATION_OF->(Vidarabine)\n(First line treatment)-TREATS->(Simplexvirus)-LOCATION_OF->(Vidarabine)\n(Acyclovir)-ISA->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Vidarabine)\n(Acyclovir)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Vidarabine)\n(Vidarabine)-TREATS->(Disease)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cytomegalovirus)\n(Vidarabine)-TREATS->(Infection)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cytomegalovirus)\n(Cytomegalovirus)-LOCATION_OF->(Glucocorticoids)-PART_OF->(Muscle)-LOCATION_OF->(Amantadine)\n(Cytomegalovirus)-CAUSES->(Functional disorder)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(MSMB gene|MSMB)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Amantadine)\n(Ganciclovir)-ISA->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(MSMB gene|MSMB)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Amantadine)\n(Ganciclovir)-TREATS->(Abnormal renal function)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(MSMB gene|MSMB)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Amantadine)\n(Encephalitis)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Simplexvirus)-LOCATION_OF->(Acyclovir)\n(Encephalitis)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Herpesvirus 1, Human)-LOCATION_OF->(Acyclovir)\n(Acyclovir)-ISA->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Vidarabine)\n(Acyclovir)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Vidarabine)\n(Herpes Simplex Infections)-PREDISPOSES->(Premature Birth)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(MSMB gene|MSMB)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Amantadine)\n(Ganciclovir)-ISA->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(MSMB gene|MSMB)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Amantadine)\n(Ganciclovir)-TREATS->(Abnormal renal function)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(MSMB gene|MSMB)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Amantadine)\n(Herpes encephalitis)-CAUSES->(Pathogenesis)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Genes)-PART_OF->(Epithelium)-LOCATION_OF->(Antiviral Therapy)\n(Herpes encephalitis)-ISA->(Inflammation)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Genes)-PART_OF->(Epithelium)-LOCATION_OF->(Antiviral Therapy)\n(Antiviral Therapy)-PREVENTS->(Simplexvirus)-LOCATION_OF->(Acyclovir)\n(Antiviral Therapy)-TREATS->(Simplexvirus)-LOCATION_OF->(Acyclovir)\n(Acyclovir)-ISA->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Vidarabine)\n(Acyclovir)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Vidarabine)\n(Herpes Simplex Infections)-PREDISPOSES->(Premature Birth)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(MSMB gene|MSMB)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Amantadine)\n(Ganciclovir)-ISA->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(MSMB gene|MSMB)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Amantadine)\n(Ganciclovir)-TREATS->(Abnormal renal function)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(MSMB gene|MSMB)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Amantadine)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"In herpes simplex encephalitis, the first-line treatment is Acyclovir, which is well-established as effective against the herpes simplex virus. Vidarabine is an alternative treatment but is less commonly used due to its side effects and lower efficacy compared to Acyclovir. Ganciclovir is primarily indicated for cytomegalovirus infections and is not effective for herpes simplex virus, thus it is not used in this context. Amantadine is an antiviral primarily used for influenza and does not have a role in treating herpes simplex encephalitis. Therefore, the correct answer to the question is Amantadine, as it is not indicated for herpes simplex encephalitis.\"\n}",
