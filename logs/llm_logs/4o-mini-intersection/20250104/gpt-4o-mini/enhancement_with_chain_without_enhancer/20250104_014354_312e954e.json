      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Drug of choice in pneumonia caused by P. carinii is :\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Penicillin\nopb. Cotrimoxazole\nopc. Kanamycin\nopd. Levofloxacin\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Pneumonia caused by P. carinii\" -> \"commonly associated with immunocompromised patients\" -> \"treatment typically involves specific antibiotics\" -> \"Cotrimoxazole is effective against P. carinii\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Pneumonia caused by P. carinii\" -> \"often seen in patients with HIV/AIDS\" -> \"standard treatment guidelines recommend Cotrimoxazole\" -> \"other options are less effective\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Pneumonia caused by P. carinii\" -> \"requires targeted antibiotic therapy\" -> \"Cotrimoxazole is the first-line treatment\" -> \"other antibiotics like Penicillin are not effective\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Pneumonia caused by P. carinii\" -> \"not typically treated with Levofloxacin\" -> \"Cotrimoxazole is the preferred choice\" -> \"Kanamycin is not indicated\" -> 80%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Pneumonia)-CAUSES->(Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome)\n(Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome)-CAUSES->(Pathogenesis)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Genes)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole Combination)\n(Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome)-PREDISPOSES->(Pathogenesis)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Genes)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole Combination)\n(Pneumonia)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Acquired immunity)-PROCESS_OF->(Organ)-LOCATION_OF->(Antibiotic therapy)\n(Pneumonia)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Immunity)-PROCESS_OF->(Organ)-LOCATION_OF->(Antibiotic therapy)\n(Antibiotic therapy)-CAUSES->(Shock)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Genes)-PART_OF->(Bone Marrow)-LOCATION_OF->(First line treatment)\n(Antibiotic therapy)-PREVENTS->(Shock)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Genes)-PART_OF->(Bone Marrow)-LOCATION_OF->(First line treatment)\n(Pneumonia)-ISA->(Infection)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Bactericidal activity)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Levofloxacin)\n(Pneumonia)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Infection)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Bactericidal activity)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Levofloxacin)\n(Treated with)-TREATS->(Atherosclerosis)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Genes)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole Combination)\n(Levofloxacin)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(BMP1|PRCP|PGPEP1)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole Combination)\n(Levofloxacin)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole Combination)\n(Trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole Combination)-TREATS->(Staphylococcus aureus)-LOCATION_OF->(Kanamycin)\n(Trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole Combination)-TREATS->(Campylobacter)-LOCATION_OF->(Kanamycin)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Pneumonia caused by Pneumocystis carinii (now known as Pneumocystis jirovecii) is primarily seen in immunocompromised patients, particularly those with HIV/AIDS. The standard treatment for this type of pneumonia is Cotrimoxazole (a combination of trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole), which is effective against P. jirovecii. Other antibiotics, such as Penicillin, Kanamycin, and Levofloxacin, are not effective for this specific infection. The reasoning chains correctly highlight that Cotrimoxazole is the first-line treatment, while the evidence paths confirm its association with immunocompromised states and its effectiveness against P. jirovecii. Therefore, the drug of choice for pneumonia caused by P. carinii is Cotrimoxazole.\"\n}",
