      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Physiology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Shock causes:\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Stagnant hypoxia\nopb. Anemic hypoxia\nopc. Hypoxic hypoxia\nopd. Histotoxic hypoxia\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Shock\" -> \"decreased perfusion to tissues\" -> \"reduced oxygen delivery\" -> \"stagnant hypoxia\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Shock\" -> \"decreased blood volume\" -> \"reduced oxygen-carrying capacity\" -> \"anemic hypoxia\" -> 70%\nCHAIN: \"Shock\" -> \"impaired oxygen utilization\" -> \"inadequate oxygen at cellular level\" -> \"hypoxic hypoxia\" -> 75%\nCHAIN: \"Shock\" -> \"toxic substances in the blood\" -> \"impaired cellular respiration\" -> \"histotoxic hypoxia\" -> 80%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Oxygen)-COMPLICATES->(Hypoxia)\n(Shock)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Genes)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Adrenal Cortex Hormones)-ISA->(Perfusion (procedure))\n(Shock)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Genes)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Ouabain)-ISA->(Perfusion (procedure))\n(Shock)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Corticotropin|POMC)-PART_OF->(Blood)\n(Shock)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(ARSE)-PART_OF->(Blood)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Shock can lead to various types of hypoxia due to decreased perfusion and oxygen delivery to tissues. 1. Stagnant hypoxia occurs when blood flow is inadequate, leading to reduced oxygen transport to tissues, which aligns with the chain's reasoning. 2. Anemic hypoxia is characterized by a reduced oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood, which can occur in shock due to decreased blood volume or hemoglobin levels. 3. Hypoxic hypoxia results from inadequate oxygen availability at the cellular level, which can be a consequence of shock. 4. Histotoxic hypoxia arises when cells cannot utilize oxygen effectively, often due to toxic substances affecting cellular respiration, which can also be a result of shock. Each type of hypoxia is relevant in the context of shock, confirming that all options are valid consequences of shock, supported by the consensus on the physiological effects of shock on oxygen delivery and utilization.\"\n}",
