      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Biochemistry.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Urine osmolality in Diabetes insipidus is\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. <150 mmol/L\nopb. <300 mmol/L\nopc. <600 mmol/L\nopd. <900 mmol/L\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Diabetes insipidus\" -> \"impaired water reabsorption\" -> \"dilute urine\" -> \"urine osmolality <300 mmol/L\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Diabetes insipidus\" -> \"deficiency of antidiuretic hormone (ADH)\" -> \"inability to concentrate urine\" -> \"urine osmolality <600 mmol/L\" -> 80%\nCHAIN: \"Diabetes insipidus\" -> \"excessive urination\" -> \"low urine concentration\" -> \"urine osmolality <150 mmol/L\" -> 70%\nCHAIN: \"Diabetes insipidus\" -> \"increased thirst and urination\" -> \"urine remains dilute\" -> \"urine osmolality <900 mmol/L\" -> 75%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Diabetes Insipidus)-CAUSES->(Disease)-COMPLICATES->(Inflammatory Response)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(human AVP protein)\n(Diabetes Insipidus)-COMPLICATES->(Disease)-COMPLICATES->(Inflammatory Response)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(human AVP protein)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"In Diabetes Insipidus (DI), there is a deficiency of antidiuretic hormone (ADH), leading to impaired water reabsorption in the kidneys. This results in the production of dilute urine, characterized by low urine osmolality. The standard consensus indicates that urine osmolality in DI is typically less than 300 mmol/L, often around 100-200 mmol/L, reflecting the inability to concentrate urine. Therefore, the most accurate option is <300 mmol/L. The evidence paths regarding the association of DI with the human AVP protein (arginine vasopressin) support the understanding of the hormonal deficiency involved in DI, but they do not directly alter the consensus on urine osmolality.\"\n}",
