Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4.

Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2.

Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Testosterone production is primarily attributed to Leydig cells, which are located in the interstitial space of the testes. Leydig cells synthesize testosterone in response to luteinizing hormone (LH) stimulation, making them the main contributors to testosterone production in males. Sertoli cells, found in the seminiferous tubules, support spermatogenesis but do not produce testosterone. The epididymis is involved in sperm maturation and does not produce hormones. Therefore, the correct answer is Leydig cells, as they are the primary source of testosterone in males.\"\n}",
