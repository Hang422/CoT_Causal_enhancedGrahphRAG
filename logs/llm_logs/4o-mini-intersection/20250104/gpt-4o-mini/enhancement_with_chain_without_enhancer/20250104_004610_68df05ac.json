      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Aminoglycoside affects ?\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Outer hair cells in basal area\nopb. Inner hair cells in basal area\nopc. Outer hair cells in apical area\nopd. Inner hair cells in apical area\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Aminoglycosides are ototoxic\" -> \"affect hair cells in the cochlea\" -> \"primarily damage outer hair cells\" -> \"most affected in the basal area\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Aminoglycosides disrupt protein synthesis\" -> \"lead to cell death in sensory cells\" -> \"outer hair cells are more vulnerable\" -> \"damage occurs in the basal area\" -> 80%\nCHAIN: \"Aminoglycosides are known to cause hearing loss\" -> \"associated with damage to hair cells\" -> \"outer hair cells in the cochlea are primarily affected\" -> \"most damage occurs in the basal area\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Aminoglycosides can lead to apoptosis in hair cells\" -> \"inner and outer hair cells are affected\" -> \"outer hair cells are more susceptible\" -> \"damage is more pronounced in the basal area\" -> 75%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Aminoglycosides)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Genes)-PART_OF->(Hair Cells)\n(Aminoglycosides)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Genes)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Hair Cells)\n(Hair Cells)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Hair Cells, Outer)\n(Cochlear structure)-LOCATION_OF->(ATOH1)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Hair Cells, Outer)\n(Cochlear structure)-LOCATION_OF->(SLC26A5)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Hair Cells, Outer)\n(Aminoglycosides)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Genes)-PART_OF->(Hair Cells)\n(Aminoglycosides)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Genes)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Hair Cells)\n(Deafness)-CAUSES->(Leak NOS)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Genes)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Hair Cells)\n(Deafness)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Autoimmune)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Genes)-PART_OF->(Hair Cells)\n(Hair Cells)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Hair Cells, Outer)\n(Aminoglycosides)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Genes)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Hair Cells, Outer)\n(Aminoglycosides)-INTERACTS_WITH->(CA2)-PART_OF->(Hair Cells, Outer)\n(Hair Cells)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Hair Cells, Outer)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Aminoglycosides are known to be ototoxic and primarily affect the outer hair cells in the cochlea, particularly in the basal area. This is supported by evidence that aminoglycosides disrupt protein synthesis, leading to cell death, with outer hair cells being more vulnerable to damage. The consensus indicates that the most significant damage occurs in the basal region of the cochlea, where outer hair cells are predominantly located. Therefore, the correct answer is that aminoglycosides affect the outer hair cells in the basal area.\"\n}",
