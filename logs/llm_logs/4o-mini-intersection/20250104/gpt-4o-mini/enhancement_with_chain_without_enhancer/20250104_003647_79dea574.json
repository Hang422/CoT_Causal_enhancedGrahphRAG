Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"The 6-month-old male baby presents with vomiting, lethargy, and severe jaundice after the introduction of fruit juice, indicating a possible metabolic disorder related to fructose metabolism. The symptoms are consistent with hereditary fructose intolerance, which is caused by a deficiency in Aldolase B. This enzyme is crucial for the metabolism of fructose, and its deficiency leads to the accumulation of fructose-1-phosphate, resulting in severe symptoms upon fructose ingestion, including vomiting and jaundice. Other options, such as Fructokinase and Aldolase A, are less likely to cause such severe symptoms in this context. The evidence supports that Aldolase B is the defective enzyme in this case.\"\n}",
