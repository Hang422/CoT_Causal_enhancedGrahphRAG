      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Drug of choice for neurogenic diabetes insipidus\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Vasopressin\nopb. Terlipressin\nopc. Desmopressin\nopd. Pralipressin\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Neurogenic diabetes insipidus\" -> \"characterized by insufficient vasopressin\" -> \"requires replacement therapy\" -> \"Desmopressin is a synthetic vasopressin analog\" -> \"commonly used for treatment\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Neurogenic diabetes insipidus\" -> \"caused by lack of ADH production\" -> \"Desmopressin mimics ADH\" -> \"reduces urine output\" -> \"improves symptoms\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Neurogenic diabetes insipidus\" -> \"treatment options include vasopressin analogs\" -> \"Desmopressin is preferred\" -> \"due to its efficacy and safety profile\" -> 92%\nCHAIN: \"Neurogenic diabetes insipidus\" -> \"can be treated with vasopressin\" -> \"but Desmopressin is more effective\" -> \"in managing symptoms\" -> 88%\nCHAIN: \"Neurogenic diabetes insipidus\" -> \"requires management of excessive urination\" -> \"Desmopressin effectively reduces urine volume\" -> \"making it the drug of choice\" -> 93%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Replacement therapy)-CAUSES->(Complication)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Deamino Arginine Vasopressin)\n(Replacement therapy)-PREVENTS->(Complication)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Deamino Arginine Vasopressin)\n(Central Diabetes Insipidus)-PREDISPOSES->(Pathogenesis)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Alcohol dehydrogenase)\n(Alcohol dehydrogenase)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cells)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Deamino Arginine Vasopressin)\n(Treated with)-TREATS->(Atherosclerosis)-CAUSES->(Complication)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Deamino Arginine Vasopressin)\n(Treated with)-TREATS->(Atherosclerosis)-PREDISPOSES->(Complication)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Deamino Arginine Vasopressin)\n(excessive urination)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Diabetes Insipidus, Nephrogenic)-CAUSES->(Complication)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Deamino Arginine Vasopressin)\n(excessive urination)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Rare Diseases)-PREDISPOSES->(Complication)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Deamino Arginine Vasopressin)\n(Deamino Arginine Vasopressin)-ISA->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Neurogenic diabetes insipidus is characterized by insufficient production of antidiuretic hormone (ADH), leading to excessive urination. The drug of choice for this condition is Desmopressin, a synthetic analog of vasopressin (ADH), which effectively mimics its action and reduces urine output. Desmopressin is preferred due to its efficacy and safety profile compared to other options like vasopressin, terlipressin, and pralipressin. Evidence supports that Desmopressin is effective in managing symptoms of neurogenic diabetes insipidus, making it the standard treatment. The retrieved evidence regarding Deamino Arginine Vasopressin (another name for Desmopressin) confirms its role in replacement therapy for this condition.\"\n}",
