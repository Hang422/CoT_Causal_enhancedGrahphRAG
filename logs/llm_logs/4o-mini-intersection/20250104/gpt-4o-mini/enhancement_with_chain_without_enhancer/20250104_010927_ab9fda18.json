      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        A Patient who is on antihypertensive drug develops a dry cough. Which of the following drug might be responsible for the condition:\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Diuretics\nopb. ACE inhibitors\nopc. Calcium channel blockers\nopd. Beta blockers\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Antihypertensive drug\" -> \"possible side effects\" -> \"dry cough\" -> \"ACE inhibitors commonly cause cough\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Antihypertensive drug\" -> \"dry cough developed\" -> \"consider drug classes\" -> \"ACE inhibitors linked to cough\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Patient on antihypertensive\" -> \"experiences dry cough\" -> \"evaluate drug options\" -> \"ACE inhibitors known for cough\" -> 80%\nCHAIN: \"Antihypertensive medication\" -> \"side effect of dry cough\" -> \"most likely due to ACE inhibitors\" -> 75%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Antihypertensive Agents)-CAUSES->(Disease)-CAUSES->(Non-productive cough)\n(Antihypertensive Agents)-CAUSES->(Symptoms)-CAUSES->(Non-productive cough)\n(Antihypertensive Agents)-TREATS->(COVID-19)-CAUSES->(Non-productive cough)\n(Antihypertensive Agents)-CAUSES->(Disease)-CAUSES->(Non-productive cough)\n(Antihypertensive Agents)-CAUSES->(Symptoms)-CAUSES->(Non-productive cough)\n(Antihypertensive Agents)-TREATS->(COVID-19)-CAUSES->(Non-productive cough)\n(Non-productive cough)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Disease)-CAUSES->(Complication)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors)\n(Non-productive cough)-ISA->(Disease)-COMPLICATES->(Complication)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors)\n(Adverse effects)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Complication)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors)\n(Adverse effects)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Abnormal renal function)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors)\n(Non-productive cough)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Disease)-CAUSES->(Complication)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors)\n(Non-productive cough)-ISA->(Disease)-COMPLICATES->(Complication)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"The development of a dry cough in a patient on antihypertensive medication is most commonly associated with ACE inhibitors. This class of drugs is known to cause a non-productive cough due to the accumulation of bradykinin, a peptide that can lead to irritation of the respiratory tract. The reasoning chains consistently point to ACE inhibitors as the likely cause of the cough, with confidence levels ranging from 75% to 90%. Evidence paths confirm that non-productive cough is a recognized adverse effect associated with ACE inhibitors, further supporting the consensus that they are the primary culprits in this scenario. Other antihypertensive classes, such as diuretics, calcium channel blockers, and beta blockers, are not typically linked to cough as a side effect.\"\n}",
