      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Biochemistry.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4.

Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Wernicke's encephalopathy is primarily associated with thiamine (vitamin B1) deficiency. This condition is characterized by symptoms such as confusion and ataxia, which are directly linked to thiamine deficiency. Chronic alcoholism is a significant risk factor, as it often leads to poor nutritional intake and malabsorption syndromes, further contributing to thiamine deficiency. The reasoning chains consistently point to thiamine as the critical vitamin involved, and the evidence paths confirm the relationship between Wernicke's encephalopathy and thiamine deficiency, particularly in the context of malnutrition and chronic alcoholism. Therefore, the major vitamin deficiency in Wernicke's encephalopathy is vitamin B1.\"\n}",
