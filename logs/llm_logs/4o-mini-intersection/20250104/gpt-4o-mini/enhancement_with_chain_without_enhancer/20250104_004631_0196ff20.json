      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        All of the following side effects are produced by Cisplatin except\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Ototoxicity\nopb. Nephrotoxicity\nopc. Coasting effect\nopd. Pulmonary fibrosis\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Cisplatin\" -> \"known to cause ototoxicity\" -> \"associated with hearing loss\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Cisplatin\" -> \"known to cause nephrotoxicity\" -> \"can lead to renal impairment\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Cisplatin\" -> \"not associated with coasting effect\" -> \"coasting effect is related to other drugs\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Cisplatin\" -> \"not typically linked to pulmonary fibrosis\" -> \"pulmonary fibrosis is more common with other agents\" -> 80%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Cisplatin)-CAUSES->(Ototoxicity)\n(Ototoxicity)-CAUSES->(Deafness)\n(Cisplatin)-CAUSES->(Toxic nephropathy)\n(Toxic nephropathy)-CAUSES->(Diabetes Mellitus, Insulin-Dependent)-CAUSES->(Renal Insufficiency)\n(Toxic nephropathy)-CAUSES->(Kidney Diseases)-CAUSES->(Renal Insufficiency)\n(Toxic nephropathy)-CAUSES->(Complication)-CAUSES->(Renal Insufficiency)\n(Cisplatin)-CAUSES->(Disease)-CAUSES->(Pulmonary Fibrosis)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Cisplatin is known to cause ototoxicity, which can lead to hearing loss, and nephrotoxicity, resulting in renal impairment. The coasting effect is not associated with Cisplatin but rather with other chemotherapeutic agents, confirming that this is not a side effect of Cisplatin. Additionally, while there is some evidence suggesting a potential link between Cisplatin and pulmonary fibrosis, it is not a typical or well-established side effect compared to other agents. Therefore, the correct answer is that Cisplatin does not produce the coasting effect.\"\n}",
