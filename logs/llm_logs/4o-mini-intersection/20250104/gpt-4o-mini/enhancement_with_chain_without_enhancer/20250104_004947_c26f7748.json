      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4.

Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Myoclonus in children is often associated with epilepsy, and the treatment options vary based on the specific type of myoclonus. Clonazepam is recognized as effective for myoclonic seizures, as it reduces myoclonic jerks and is commonly used in clinical practice. Sodium Valproate is also used for various seizure types, including some myoclonic cases, but is not as effective as Clonazepam for myoclonus specifically. Phenobarbital is a barbiturate anticonvulsant that is less effective for myoclonic seizures and is not considered a first-line treatment. Ethosuximide primarily treats absence seizures and is not recommended for myoclonic seizures. Therefore, the best treatment for myoclonus in children is Clonazepam, supported by its established efficacy in managing myoclonic seizures.\"\n}",
