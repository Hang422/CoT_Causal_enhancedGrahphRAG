Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"The child presents with symptoms that suggest a specific enzyme deficiency. The reasoning for each option is as follows: \\n\\n1. **HGPRTase**: The child shows symptoms consistent with Lesch-Nyhan syndrome, which is caused by a deficiency of HGPRTase. This leads to the accumulation of uric acid, resulting in increased risk of gout and neurological symptoms. This reasoning aligns with consensus. \\n\\n2. **Adenosine deaminase**: If the child exhibits signs of severe combined immunodeficiency, this would indicate a deficiency of adenosine deaminase. This condition leads to the accumulation of toxic metabolites and impaired lymphocyte function, which is well-supported by consensus. \\n\\n3. **APRTase**: Symptoms of kidney stones and hyperuricemia could suggest a deficiency of APRTase, leading to increased levels of uric acid. However, this is less common and less definitive than the previous two options. \\n\\n4. **Acid maltase**: The child has muscle weakness and cardiomyopathy, which are indicative of Pompe disease caused by acid maltase deficiency. This aligns with consensus regarding glycogen storage diseases. \\n\\nIn conclusion, the most likely deficiencies based on the symptoms presented are HGPRTase and adenosine deaminase, with the former being strongly associated with Lesch-Nyhan syndrome and the latter with severe combined immunodeficiency. The evidence paths related to glycogen storage diseases and adenosine deaminase support these conclusions but are less directly relevant to the specific enzyme deficiencies in this case.\"\n}",
