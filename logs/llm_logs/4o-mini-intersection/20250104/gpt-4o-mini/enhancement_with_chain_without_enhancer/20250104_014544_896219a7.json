      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Praziquantel is used for the treatment of\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Strongyloidiasis\nopb. Trichomoniasis\nopc. Schistosomiasis\nopd. Rhinosporidiosis\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Praziquantel\" -> \"antiparasitic medication\" -> \"effective against trematodes\" -> \"commonly used for schistosomiasis\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Praziquantel\" -> \"antiparasitic medication\" -> \"not effective against nematodes\" -> \"strongyloidiasis is caused by nematodes\" -> 80%\nCHAIN: \"Praziquantel\" -> \"antiparasitic medication\" -> \"not indicated for trichomoniasis\" -> \"trichomoniasis is a protozoan infection\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Praziquantel\" -> \"antiparasitic medication\" -> \"not used for rhinosporidiosis\" -> \"rhinosporidiosis is caused by a fungus\" -> 90%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Trichomonas Infections)-PREDISPOSES->(Infection)-CAUSES->(Protozoan Infections)\n(Trichomonas Infections)-PREDISPOSES->(Virus Diseases)-PREDISPOSES->(Protozoan Infections)\n(Rhinosporidiosis)-ISA->(Disease)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(fungus)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Praziquantel is an antiparasitic medication primarily effective against trematodes, particularly used for the treatment of schistosomiasis. It is not effective against nematodes, which are responsible for strongyloidiasis, nor is it indicated for trichomoniasis, a protozoan infection, or rhinosporidiosis, which is caused by a fungus. Therefore, the correct use of praziquantel is for schistosomiasis.\"\n}",
