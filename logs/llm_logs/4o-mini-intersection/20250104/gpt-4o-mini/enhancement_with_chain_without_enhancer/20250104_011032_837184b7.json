      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Thaliomide is used in all except ?\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. ENL\nopb. HIV neuropathy\nopc. HIV associated ulcer\nopd. Behcet's syndrome\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Thalidomide\" -> \"used for ENL\" -> \"effective in treating leprosy\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Thalidomide\" -> \"not indicated for HIV neuropathy\" -> \"limited evidence of efficacy\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Thalidomide\" -> \"not used for HIV associated ulcer\" -> \"no established benefit\" -> 80%\nCHAIN: \"Thalidomide\" -> \"used for Behcet's syndrome\" -> \"reduces inflammatory symptoms\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Thalidomide\" -> \"used in multiple conditions\" -> \"not for HIV neuropathy or ulcer\" -> 75%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Thalidomide)-PREVENTS->(Symptoms)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Neuropathy due to human immunodeficiency virus)\n(Thalidomide)-TREATS->(HIV)\n(Thalidomide)-TREATS->(Behcet Syndrome)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

It is not indicated for HIV neuropathy or HIV-associated ulcers, as there is limited evidence supporting its efficacy in these conditions.
