      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Schizophrenia is treated by:\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Anti depressants\nopb. Anti psychotics\nopc. Anti epileptics\nopd. Mood stabilizers\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Schizophrenia\" -> \"characterized by psychotic symptoms\" -> \"requires management of psychosis\" -> \"anti-psychotics are effective\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Schizophrenia\" -> \"often involves mood disturbances\" -> \"mood stabilizers may help\" -> \"not first-line treatment\" -> \"anti-psychotics are preferred\" -> 80%\nCHAIN: \"Schizophrenia\" -> \"can have comorbid conditions\" -> \"anti-depressants may be used\" -> \"not primary treatment for schizophrenia\" -> \"anti-psychotics are standard\" -> 75%\nCHAIN: \"Schizophrenia\" -> \"may involve seizures in some cases\" -> \"anti-epileptics could be considered\" -> \"not standard treatment\" -> \"anti-psychotics are primary\" -> 70%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Schizophrenia)-CAUSES->(Disease)-CAUSES->(Psychotic symptom)\n(Schizophrenia)-CAUSES->(Infection)-CAUSES->(Psychotic symptom)\n(Schizophrenia)-CAUSES->(Symptoms)-CAUSES->(Psychotic symptom)\n(Psychotic symptom)-PREDISPOSES->(Psychotic Disorders)\n(Schizophrenia)-CAUSES->(Disease)-CAUSES->(Seizures)\n(Schizophrenia)-CAUSES->(Obesity)-CAUSES->(Seizures)\n(Schizophrenia)-CAUSES->(Infection)-CAUSES->(Seizures)\n(Schizophrenia)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(physiological aspects)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Oxygen)-TREATS->(Disturbance in mood)\n(Schizophrenia)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(physiological aspects)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Hydrocortisone)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Disturbance in mood)\n(Mood Stabilizers)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Antipsychotic Agents)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Genes)-PART_OF->(Bone Marrow)-LOCATION_OF->(First line treatment)\n(Mood Stabilizers)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Antidepressive Agents)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Genes)-PART_OF->(Mucous Membrane)-LOCATION_OF->(First line treatment)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Schizophrenia is primarily treated with antipsychotics, which are effective in managing psychotic symptoms. While mood stabilizers and antidepressants may be used in certain cases, they are not considered first-line treatments for schizophrenia. Antiepileptics are also not standard treatments, although they may be considered in specific cases of comorbidity. The consensus supports that antipsychotics are the mainstay of treatment, with other medications being adjunctive rather than primary therapies.\"\n}",
