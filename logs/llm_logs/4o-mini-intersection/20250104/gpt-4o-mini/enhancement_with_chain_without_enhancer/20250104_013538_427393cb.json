      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Which of the following drug is contraindicated in a patient of myasthenia gravis: September 2008\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Succinylcholine\nopb. Tubocurare\nopc. Pyridostigmine\nopd. Halothane\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Myasthenia gravis\" -> \"autoimmune neuromuscular disorder\" -> \"characterized by weakness and fatigue\" -> \"increased risk of respiratory failure with certain drugs\" -> \"Succinylcholine causes muscle paralysis\" -> \"may exacerbate weakness in myasthenia gravis\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Myasthenia gravis\" -> \"requires careful management of neuromuscular function\" -> \"Tubocurare is a neuromuscular blocker\" -> \"can lead to respiratory muscle weakness\" -> \"not ideal for myasthenia gravis patients\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Myasthenia gravis\" -> \"treatment often includes cholinesterase inhibitors\" -> \"Pyridostigmine is a cholinesterase inhibitor\" -> \"improves neuromuscular transmission\" -> \"generally safe for myasthenia gravis\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Myasthenia gravis\" -> \"anesthetic considerations are critical\" -> \"Halothane is a volatile anesthetic\" -> \"may cause muscle relaxation\" -> \"not specifically contraindicated but requires caution\" -> 80%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Asthenia)-CAUSES->(Respiratory Failure)\n(Fatigue)-CAUSES->(Respiratory Failure)\n(Induction of neuromuscular blockade)-CAUSES->(Disease)-CAUSES->(Asthenia)\n(Induction of neuromuscular blockade)-CAUSES->(Obesity)-CAUSES->(Asthenia)\n(Induction of neuromuscular blockade)-CAUSES->(Adverse effects)-PREDISPOSES->(Asthenia)\n(Succinylcholine)-CAUSES->(Disease)-CAUSES->(Asthenia)\n(Succinylcholine)-CAUSES->(Hereditary Diseases)-CAUSES->(Asthenia)\n(Succinylcholine)-TREATS->(Obesity)-CAUSES->(Asthenia)\n(Halothane)-CAUSES->(Lack of sensation)-CAUSES->(Muscle hypotonia)\n(Halothane)-PREVENTS->(Pain)-CAUSES->(Muscle hypotonia)\n(Halothane)-PREVENTS->(Muscle Rigidity)-CAUSES->(Muscle hypotonia)\n(Respiratory Failure)-CAUSES->(Inflammation)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Genes)-PART_OF->(Tissue fiber)-LOCATION_OF->(Induction of neuromuscular blockade)\n(Respiratory Failure)-PREDISPOSES->(Inflammation)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Genes)-PART_OF->(Tissue fiber)-LOCATION_OF->(Induction of neuromuscular blockade)\n(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-PART_OF->(Cells)-PART_OF->(Muscle)-LOCATION_OF->(Induction of neuromuscular blockade)\n(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-PART_OF->(Cells)-PART_OF->(Fascicle)-LOCATION_OF->(Induction of neuromuscular blockade)\n(Myasthenia Gravis)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Adverse event)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cholinesterase Inhibitors)\n(Cholinesterase Inhibitors)-ISA->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(SOST gene|SOST)-INTERACTS_WITH->(LRP4 gene|LRP4|CORIN)-INTERACTS_WITH->(COLQ gene|COLQ)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Pyridostigmine)\n(Cholinesterase Inhibitors)-TREATS->(Inflammation)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(SOST gene|SOST)-INTERACTS_WITH->(LRP4 gene|LRP4|CORIN)-INTERACTS_WITH->(COLQ gene|COLQ)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Pyridostigmine)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"In myasthenia gravis, an autoimmune neuromuscular disorder characterized by muscle weakness, certain drugs can exacerbate symptoms and increase the risk of respiratory failure. Succinylcholine, a neuromuscular blocker, can lead to significant muscle paralysis and is contraindicated due to its potential to worsen weakness in these patients. Tubocurare, another neuromuscular blocker, is also not ideal as it can induce respiratory muscle weakness, making it unsuitable for myasthenia gravis patients. Pyridostigmine, a cholinesterase inhibitor, is commonly used to improve neuromuscular transmission and is generally safe for these patients. Halothane, while a volatile anesthetic that may cause muscle relaxation, is not specifically contraindicated but requires caution due to its potential effects on neuromuscular function. Therefore, the drugs contraindicated in myasthenia gravis are Succinylcholine and Tubocurare.\"\n}",
