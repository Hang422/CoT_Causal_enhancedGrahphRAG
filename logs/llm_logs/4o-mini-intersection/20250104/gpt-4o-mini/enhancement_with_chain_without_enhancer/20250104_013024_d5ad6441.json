Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4.

Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Methylphenidate is the drug of choice for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), as it is a central nervous system stimulant that effectively increases attention span and reduces impulsivity, aligning with clinical guidelines that recommend stimulant medications as first-line treatments. Haloperidol, an antipsychotic, is not typically used for ADHD and may complicate its management. Imipramine, a tricyclic antidepressant, is not considered a first-line treatment for ADHD. Alprazolam, a benzodiazepine, is also not indicated for ADHD and may complicate its symptoms. Therefore, the consensus supports methylphenidate as the preferred choice for ADHD management.\"\n}",
