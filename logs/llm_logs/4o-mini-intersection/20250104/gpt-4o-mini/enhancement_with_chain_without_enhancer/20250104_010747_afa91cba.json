      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Physiology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Aldosterone acts at:\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Collecting duct\nopb. Glomerulus\nopc. Proximal convoluted tubule\nopd. Loop of Henle\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Aldosterone is a hormone\" -> \"regulates sodium and potassium levels\" -> \"acts primarily on the kidneys\" -> \"specifically at the collecting duct\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Aldosterone influences electrolyte balance\" -> \"promotes sodium reabsorption\" -> \"increases water retention\" -> \"acts at the collecting duct\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Aldosterone is secreted by the adrenal glands\" -> \"targets renal tubules\" -> \"mainly affects the collecting duct\" -> \"increases sodium reabsorption\" -> 92%\nCHAIN: \"Aldosterone's primary action site is in the nephron\" -> \"it acts on specific segments\" -> \"the collecting duct is one of them\" -> \"influences fluid balance\" -> 88%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Body fluid retention)-CAUSES->(Hypertensive disease)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(uptake)-PROCESS_OF->(Duct (organ) structure)\n(Aldosterone)-CAUSES->(Cytoprotection)-PROCESS_OF->(Renal tubule structure)\n(Aldosterone)-CAUSES->(Excretory function)-PROCESS_OF->(Renal tubule structure)\n(Aldosterone)-CAUSES->(uptake)-PROCESS_OF->(Renal tubule structure)\n(Serum potassium assay)-DIAGNOSES->(Disease)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(physiological aspects)-PROCESS_OF->(Kidney)\n(Serum potassium assay)-DIAGNOSES->(Heart Arrest)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Hemoglobin)-PART_OF->(Kidney)\n(Kidney)-PART_OF->(Duct (organ) structure)\n(Adrenal Glands)-LOCATION_OF->(CA2)-PART_OF->(Renal tubule structure)\n(Adrenal Glands)-PART_OF->(Lung)-PART_OF->(Renal tubule structure)\n(Renal tubule structure)-PART_OF->(Breast collecting duct)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Aldosterone is a hormone secreted by the adrenal glands that plays a crucial role in regulating sodium and potassium levels in the body. Its primary action occurs in the kidneys, specifically at the collecting duct of the nephron, where it promotes sodium reabsorption and increases water retention. This mechanism is essential for maintaining fluid balance and blood pressure. The reasoning chains consistently point to the collecting duct as the main site of aldosterone action, supported by the consensus that aldosterone primarily influences renal tubules, particularly the collecting duct, to regulate electrolyte balance.\"\n}",
