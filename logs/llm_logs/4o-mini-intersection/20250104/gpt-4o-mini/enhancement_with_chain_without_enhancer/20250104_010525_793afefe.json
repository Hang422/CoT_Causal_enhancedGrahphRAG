      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Schizophrenia is treated by\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Anti depressants\nopb. Anti psychotics\nopc. Anti epileptics\nopd. Mood stabilizers\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Schizophrenia\" -> \"requires management of psychotic symptoms\" -> \"anti-psychotic medications are effective\" -> \"reduces hallucinations and delusions\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Schizophrenia\" -> \"characterized by psychosis\" -> \"anti-psychotics are the primary treatment\" -> \"improves overall functioning\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Schizophrenia\" -> \"often involves mood disturbances\" -> \"mood stabilizers may help\" -> \"not first-line treatment\" -> \"less effective than anti-psychotics\" -> 70%\nCHAIN: \"Schizophrenia\" -> \"can have comorbid conditions\" -> \"anti-depressants may be used\" -> \"not primary treatment for schizophrenia\" -> \"unclear efficacy\" -> 60%\nCHAIN: \"Schizophrenia\" -> \"may involve seizures in some cases\" -> \"anti-epileptics could be considered\" -> \"not standard treatment\" -> \"unclear role in management\" -> 50%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Schizophrenia)-CAUSES->(Disease)-CAUSES->(Psychotic symptom)\n(Schizophrenia)-CAUSES->(Infection)-CAUSES->(Psychotic symptom)\n(Schizophrenia)-CAUSES->(Symptoms)-CAUSES->(Psychotic symptom)\n(Schizophrenia)-CAUSES->(Psychotic Disorders)\n(Schizophrenia)-CAUSES->(Disease)-CAUSES->(Seizures)\n(Schizophrenia)-CAUSES->(Obesity)-CAUSES->(Seizures)\n(Schizophrenia)-CAUSES->(Infection)-CAUSES->(Seizures)\n(Schizophrenia)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(physiological aspects)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Oxygen)-TREATS->(Disturbance in mood)\n(Schizophrenia)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(physiological aspects)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Hydrocortisone)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Disturbance in mood)\n(Mood Stabilizers)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Antipsychotic Agents)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Genes)-PART_OF->(Bone Marrow)-LOCATION_OF->(First line treatment)\n(Mood Stabilizers)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Antidepressive Agents)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Genes)-PART_OF->(Mucous Membrane)-LOCATION_OF->(First line treatment)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Schizophrenia is primarily treated with anti-psychotic medications, which are effective in managing psychotic symptoms such as hallucinations and delusions. This aligns with the consensus that anti-psychotics are the first-line treatment for schizophrenia, improving overall functioning. While mood stabilizers may be used in some cases, they are not considered first-line treatments and are generally less effective than anti-psychotics. Anti-depressants may be prescribed for comorbid conditions but are not the primary treatment for schizophrenia, and their efficacy in this context is unclear. Anti-epileptics are not standard treatment for schizophrenia and have an uncertain role in management. Therefore, the most appropriate treatment option for schizophrenia is anti-psychotics.\"\n}",
