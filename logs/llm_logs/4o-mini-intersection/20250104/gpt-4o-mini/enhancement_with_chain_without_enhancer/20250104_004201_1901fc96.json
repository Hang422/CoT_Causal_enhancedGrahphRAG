Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Atropine is a muscarinic receptor antagonist that blocks the effects of acetylcholine at muscarinic receptors. It effectively prevents bradycardia caused by acetylcholine infusion, as it inhibits the parasympathetic effects that lead to decreased heart rate. However, atropine does not affect nicotinic receptors, meaning it cannot block the increased blood pressure caused by nicotine, which acts primarily through nicotinic receptors. Additionally, neostigmine, an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, increases acetylcholine levels, enhancing skeletal muscle strength via nicotinic receptors, which are unaffected by atropine. Therefore, the only effect that can be blocked by atropine is bradycardia caused by acetylcholine. The correct answer is that not all effects are blocked by atropine, specifically only bradycardia is blocked, while the effects of nicotine and neostigmine remain unaffected.\"\n}",
