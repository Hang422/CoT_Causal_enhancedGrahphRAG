Insulin also causes hypokalemia by driving potassium into cells, a confirmed effect. Carbenoxolone inhibits mineralocorticoid activity, leading to increased potassium excretion and hypokalemia. Cyclosporine's effect on potassium is less clear, with some evidence suggesting possible hypokalemia but not a confirmed effect. NSAIDs typically do not cause hypokalemia; instead, they can lead to hyperkalemia due to decreased renal blood flow. Therefore, the correct drugs causing hypokalemia are Amphotericin B, Insulin, and Carbenoxolone.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"To determine which drugs cause hypokalemia, we analyze each option based on established pharmacological knowledge. Amphotericin B is known to cause hypokalemia due to renal potassium loss. Insulin drives potassium into cells, leading to decreased serum potassium levels, which is a well-documented effect. Carbenoxolone can inhibit mineralocorticoid activity, resulting in increased potassium excretion and hypokalemia. Cyclosporine's effect on potassium is less definitive, with some studies suggesting it may cause hypokalemia, but this is not universally accepted. NSAIDs are generally associated with hyperkalemia due to their effects on renal blood flow and do not typically cause hypokalemia. Therefore, the drugs that are confirmed to cause hypokalemia are Amphotericin B, Insulin, and Carbenoxolone. The best-supported option that includes these drugs is 'opc. abd'.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opc\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
