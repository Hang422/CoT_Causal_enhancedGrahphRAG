      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Biochemistry.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        The function of vitamin A is/are related to which of the following?\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Retinol\nopb. Retinal\nopc. Retinoic acids\nopd. All of the above\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Vitamin A\" -> \"exists in several forms\" -> \"includes retinol\" -> \"includes retinal\" -> \"includes retinoic acids\" -> \"all forms are functionally related\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Vitamin A\" -> \"essential for vision\" -> \"retinal is a key component of rhodopsin\" -> \"rhodopsin is crucial for phototransduction\" -> \"retinol and retinoic acids also play roles\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Vitamin A\" -> \"involved in gene expression\" -> \"retinoic acids act as hormones\" -> \"regulate transcription of target genes\" -> \"includes retinol and retinal in metabolic processes\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Vitamin A\" -> \"supports immune function\" -> \"retinol is important for immune cell function\" -> \"retinal and retinoic acids also contribute\" -> \"all forms support immune health\" -> 88%\nCHAIN: \"Vitamin A\" -> \"important for skin health\" -> \"retinoic acids promote skin cell turnover\" -> \"retinol is used in dermatology\" -> \"retinal also has skin benefits\" -> \"all forms contribute to skin health\" -> 90%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Vitamin A)-PART_OF->(Cells)-PART_OF->(Retina)\n(Vitamin A)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cultured Cells)-PART_OF->(Retina)\n(Retina)-PART_OF->(Liver)-LOCATION_OF->(Retinoids)\n(Retina)-PART_OF->(Tract)-LOCATION_OF->(Retinoids)\n(Vitamin A)-PART_OF->(Cells)-LOCATION_OF->(Retinoids)\n(Vitamin A)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cultured Cells)-LOCATION_OF->(Retinoids)\n(Retinoids)-CAUSES/TREATS->(Disease)-CAUSES/PREDISPOSES->(Liver Dysfunction)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Vitamin A)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Vitamin A exists in several forms, including retinol, retinal, and retinoic acids, all of which are functionally related. Retinol is essential for vision as it is converted to retinal, a key component of rhodopsin, which is crucial for phototransduction. Retinoic acids play significant roles in gene expression by acting as hormones that regulate transcription of target genes. Additionally, all forms of vitamin A support immune function and contribute to skin health, with retinoic acids promoting skin cell turnover. Therefore, the correct answer is 'All of the above' as all forms of vitamin A are involved in these essential biological functions.\"\n}",
