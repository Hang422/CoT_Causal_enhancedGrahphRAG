      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Biochemistry.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        HMP shunt occurs in all organs except ?\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Liver\nopb. Adipose tissue\nopc. RBC\nopd. Brain\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"HMP shunt primarily occurs in the liver\" -> \"Liver is a key site for glucose metabolism\" -> \"Adipose tissue also utilizes HMP shunt\" -> \"RBCs rely on HMP shunt for NADPH production\" -> \"Brain does not primarily utilize HMP shunt\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"HMP shunt is active in the liver\" -> \"Adipose tissue participates in lipid synthesis\" -> \"RBCs require NADPH from HMP shunt\" -> \"Brain primarily uses aerobic metabolism\" -> \"Brain has limited HMP shunt activity\" -> 80%\nCHAIN: \"HMP shunt is crucial for anabolic processes\" -> \"Liver and adipose tissue are involved in fat metabolism\" -> \"RBCs depend on HMP shunt for maintaining redox state\" -> \"Brain has different metabolic pathways\" -> \"Brain does not rely on HMP shunt\" -> 75%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Adipose tissue)-PART_OF->(Brain)-LOCATION_OF->(Cardiac shunt)\n(Liver)-LOCATION_OF->(TNF gene|TNF)-PART_OF->(Adipose tissue)\n(Adipose tissue)-LOCATION_OF->(Genes)-INTERACTS_WITH/PART_OF->(Erythrocytes)\n(Liver)-LOCATION_OF->(Genes)-INTERACTS_WITH/PART_OF->(Erythrocytes)\n(Cardiac shunt)-CAUSES->(Syndrome)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Virus)-LOCATION_OF->(Homologous Gene)-PART_OF->(Adipose tissue)\n(Erythrocytes)-PART_OF->(Brain)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"The HMP shunt (Hexose Monophosphate shunt) is primarily active in the liver, adipose tissue, and red blood cells (RBCs), where it plays a crucial role in generating NADPH for anabolic processes and maintaining redox balance. While the brain does have some metabolic pathways that can utilize components of the HMP shunt, it does not primarily rely on it for its energy needs, focusing instead on aerobic metabolism. Therefore, the correct answer to the question of which organ does not primarily utilize the HMP shunt is the brain.\"\n}",
