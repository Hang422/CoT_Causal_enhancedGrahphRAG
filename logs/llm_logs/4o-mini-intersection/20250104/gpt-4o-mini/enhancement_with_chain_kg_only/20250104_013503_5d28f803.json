      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Which of the following drugs is used to treat both diabetes mellitus and diabetes insipidus\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Chlorpropamide\nopb. Glibenclamide\nopc. Glicazide\nopd. Glipizide\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Chlorpropamide\" -> \"stimulates insulin release\" -> \"lowers blood glucose\" -> \"also has antidiuretic effects\" -> \"used in diabetes insipidus\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Glibenclamide\" -> \"stimulates insulin secretion\" -> \"lowers blood glucose\" -> \"no known effect on diabetes insipidus\" -> \"not used for diabetes insipidus\" -> 70%\nCHAIN: \"Glicazide\" -> \"stimulates insulin release\" -> \"lowers blood glucose\" -> \"no known effect on diabetes insipidus\" -> \"not used for diabetes insipidus\" -> 70%\nCHAIN: \"Glipizide\" -> \"stimulates insulin secretion\" -> \"lowers blood glucose\" -> \"no known effect on diabetes insipidus\" -> \"not used for diabetes insipidus\" -> 70%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Chlorpropamide)-TREATS->(Disease)-CAUSES/MANIFESTATION_OF->(Tachycardia)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Insulin)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Chlorpropamide is an oral hypoglycemic agent that stimulates insulin release and lowers blood glucose levels. Importantly, it also has antidiuretic effects, making it effective in treating diabetes insipidus. In contrast, Glibenclamide, Glicazide, and Glipizide are all sulfonylureas that primarily stimulate insulin secretion to lower blood glucose but do not have any known effects on diabetes insipidus. Therefore, among the options provided, only Chlorpropamide is used to treat both diabetes mellitus and diabetes insipidus.\"\n}",
