      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Magaldrate is conveed by gastric acid to ?\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Magnesium hydroxide\nopb. Magnesium hydroxide and calcium carbonate\nopc. Magnesium hydroxide and Aluminium hydroxide\nopd. Calcium carbonate and aluminium hydroxide\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Magaldrate\" -> \"reacts with gastric acid\" -> \"produces magnesium hydroxide\" -> \"increases pH\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Magaldrate\" -> \"interacts with gastric acid\" -> \"releases magnesium hydroxide and aluminum hydroxide\" -> \"neutralizes stomach acid\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Magaldrate\" -> \"is a compound containing magnesium\" -> \"dissociates in acidic environment\" -> \"produces magnesium hydroxide and aluminum hydroxide\" -> 80%\nCHAIN: \"Magaldrate\" -> \"is a complex antacid\" -> \"reacts with gastric acid\" -> \"produces magnesium hydroxide and calcium carbonate\" -> \"unclear\" -> 70%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(magaldrate)-TREATS->(Duodenal Ulcer)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Pathogenesis)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Glucocorticoids)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Antacids)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Magaldrate is a complex antacid that primarily reacts with gastric acid to produce magnesium hydroxide and aluminum hydroxide. This reaction helps neutralize stomach acid, which is consistent with its use in treating conditions like duodenal ulcers. The reasoning chains indicate that magnesium hydroxide is a product of this reaction, and the presence of aluminum hydroxide is also confirmed. Therefore, the most accurate option is 'Magnesium hydroxide and Aluminium hydroxide' (opc), as it aligns with the consensus on the composition of the products formed when magaldrate interacts with gastric acid.\"\n}",
