      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        A Patient who is on antihypertensive drug develops a dry cough. Which of the following drug might be responsible for the condition:\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Diuretics\nopb. ACE inhibitors\nopc. Calcium channel blockers\nopd. Beta blockers\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Antihypertensive drug\" -> \"possible side effects\" -> \"dry cough\" -> \"ACE inhibitors commonly cause cough\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Antihypertensive drug\" -> \"dry cough developed\" -> \"consider drug classes\" -> \"ACE inhibitors linked to cough\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Patient on antihypertensive\" -> \"experiences dry cough\" -> \"evaluate drug options\" -> \"ACE inhibitors known for cough\" -> 80%\nCHAIN: \"Antihypertensive medication\" -> \"side effect of dry cough\" -> \"most likely due to ACE inhibitors\" -> 75%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Antihypertensive Agents)-PREDISPOSES/PREVENTS->(Disease)-CAUSES->(Non-productive cough)-productive cough)\n(Non-productive cough)-productive cough)->(Disease)-CAUSES/COMPLICATES->(Complication)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors)-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Among antihypertensive drugs, ACE inhibitors are well-documented to cause a dry cough due to the accumulation of bradykinin, which is a common side effect. The reasoning chains consistently point to ACE inhibitors as the likely cause of the cough, with confidence levels ranging from 75% to 90%. Other classes of antihypertensives, such as diuretics, calcium channel blockers, and beta blockers, are not typically associated with this side effect. Therefore, the most probable drug responsible for the dry cough in this patient is an ACE inhibitor.\"\n}",
