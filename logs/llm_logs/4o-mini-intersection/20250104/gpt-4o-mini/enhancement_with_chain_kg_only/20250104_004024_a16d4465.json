      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Biochemistry.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Which helps in the production of more glucose?\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Pyruvate kinase\nopb. Pyruvate carboxylase\nopc. PDH\nopd. Pyruvate decarboxylase\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Pyruvate carboxylase\" -> \"converts pyruvate to oxaloacetate\" -> \"increases gluconeogenesis\" -> \"produces more glucose\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Pyruvate kinase\" -> \"catalyzes conversion of phosphoenolpyruvate to pyruvate\" -> \"decreases glucose production\" -> \"not helpful for more glucose\" -> 70%\nCHAIN: \"PDH\" -> \"converts pyruvate to acetyl-CoA\" -> \"enters the Krebs cycle\" -> \"does not directly increase glucose\" -> 60%\nCHAIN: \"Pyruvate decarboxylase\" -> \"converts pyruvate to acetaldehyde\" -> \"not involved in glucose production\" -> \"not helpful for more glucose\" -> 50%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Pyruvate Dehydrogenase Complex Deficiency Disease)-CAUSES->(Cardiac Hypertrophy)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Genes)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Acetyl Coenzyme A)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Pyruvate carboxylase is crucial for gluconeogenesis as it converts pyruvate to oxaloacetate, which is a key step in the production of glucose. This process increases glucose production, making pyruvate carboxylase the most relevant option for enhancing glucose levels. In contrast, pyruvate kinase catalyzes the conversion of phosphoenolpyruvate to pyruvate, which is part of glycolysis and decreases glucose production. Pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) converts pyruvate to acetyl-CoA, entering the Krebs cycle, and does not contribute to glucose production. Pyruvate decarboxylase converts pyruvate to acetaldehyde, which is not involved in glucose production. Therefore, the only option that directly aids in the production of more glucose is pyruvate carboxylase.\"\n}",
