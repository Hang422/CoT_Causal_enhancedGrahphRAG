      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Physiology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Which of the following results in increase in secretion of ADH?\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Hypervolemia\nopb. Hypeension\nopc. Hypovolemia\nopd. Decrease osmolarity\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Hypovolemia\" -> \"decreased blood volume\" -> \"increased plasma osmolarity\" -> \"stimulation of osmoreceptors\" -> \"increased secretion of ADH\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Hypervolemia\" -> \"increased blood volume\" -> \"decreased plasma osmolarity\" -> \"inhibition of osmoreceptors\" -> \"decreased secretion of ADH\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Hypertension\" -> \"increased blood pressure\" -> \"possible activation of baroreceptors\" -> \"inhibition of ADH secretion\" -> 80%\nCHAIN: \"Decrease osmolarity\" -> \"lower concentration of solutes in plasma\" -> \"inhibition of osmoreceptors\" -> \"decreased secretion of ADH\" -> 90%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Pressoreceptors)-LOCATION_OF->(Hypoxia)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Alcohol dehydrogenase)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"The secretion of Antidiuretic Hormone (ADH) is primarily influenced by blood volume and plasma osmolarity. In the case of hypovolemia, decreased blood volume leads to increased plasma osmolarity, which stimulates osmoreceptors and results in increased secretion of ADH. This aligns with the consensus that hypovolemia is a strong stimulus for ADH release. Conversely, hypervolemia results in increased blood volume and decreased plasma osmolarity, inhibiting ADH secretion. Hypertension typically activates baroreceptors that also inhibit ADH secretion. A decrease in osmolarity indicates lower solute concentration, which similarly inhibits ADH secretion. Therefore, the only option that results in an increase in ADH secretion is hypovolemia.\"\n}",
