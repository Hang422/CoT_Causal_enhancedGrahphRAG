      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Drug of choice for peptic ulcer disease caused by chronic use of NSAIDS:\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Pirenzepine\nopb. Loratadine\nopc. Misoprostol\nopd. Esomeprazole\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Chronic NSAID use\" -> \"increased gastric acid secretion\" -> \"mucosal damage\" -> \"peptic ulcer disease\" -> \"Misoprostol indicated for prevention\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Chronic NSAID use\" -> \"inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis\" -> \"reduced mucosal protection\" -> \"peptic ulcer disease\" -> \"Misoprostol provides mucosal protection\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Peptic ulcer disease\" -> \"NSAID-induced\" -> \"prostaglandin analogs beneficial\" -> \"Misoprostol as drug of choice\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Peptic ulcer disease\" -> \"caused by NSAIDs\" -> \"need for mucosal protection\" -> \"Misoprostol indicated\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Chronic NSAID use\" -> \"risk of peptic ulcer disease\" -> \"Misoprostol can reduce risk\" -> \"considered drug of choice\" -> 80%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Peptic Ulcer)-CAUSES/ISA->(Disease)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Excretory function)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Misoprostol)\n(Misoprostol)-ISA->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)\n(Peptic Ulcer)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Bacteria)-LOCATION_OF->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Chronic NSAID use is known to increase the risk of peptic ulcer disease due to inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis, which reduces mucosal protection in the gastrointestinal tract. Misoprostol, a prostaglandin analog, is indicated for the prevention and treatment of NSAID-induced peptic ulcers as it provides mucosal protection and promotes healing. The reasoning chains correctly highlight Misoprostol's role in this context, with a consensus that it is the drug of choice for preventing NSAID-induced ulcers. Other options, such as Pirenzepine and Loratadine, are not indicated for this condition, and Esomeprazole, while effective for acid suppression, is not specifically the first-line choice for NSAID-induced ulcers compared to Misoprostol. Therefore, Misoprostol is the most appropriate choice based on the consensus and evidence.\"\n}",
