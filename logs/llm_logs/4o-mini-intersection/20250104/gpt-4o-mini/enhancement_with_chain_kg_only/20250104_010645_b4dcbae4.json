      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Physiology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        The only Sugar normaly absorbed in the intestine against a concentration gradient is :\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Xylose\nopb. Mannose\nopc. Glucose\nopd. Ribose\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Glucose\" -> \"actively transported in the intestine\" -> \"against concentration gradient\" -> \"most common sugar absorbed\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Xylose\" -> \"absorbed passively\" -> \"not against concentration gradient\" -> \"less common in diet\" -> 80%\nCHAIN: \"Mannose\" -> \"absorbed via specific transporters\" -> \"not primarily against concentration gradient\" -> \"less significant in human metabolism\" -> 75%\nCHAIN: \"Ribose\" -> \"not primarily absorbed in the intestine\" -> \"limited dietary sources\" -> \"not a major sugar\" -> 70%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Glucose)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cells)-PART_OF->(Intestines)\n(Glucose)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Genes)-PART_OF->(Intestines)\n(Ribose)-ISA->(Sugars)-PART_OF->(Intestines)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Among the options provided, glucose is the only sugar that is actively transported in the intestine against a concentration gradient. This process is facilitated by sodium-glucose transporters (SGLT), which allow glucose to be absorbed even when its concentration is lower in the intestinal lumen compared to the inside of the intestinal cells. In contrast, xylose and mannose are absorbed passively and do not primarily utilize active transport mechanisms, while ribose is not significantly absorbed in the intestine due to limited dietary sources. Therefore, the correct answer is glucose, as it is the most common sugar absorbed against a concentration gradient.\"\n}",
