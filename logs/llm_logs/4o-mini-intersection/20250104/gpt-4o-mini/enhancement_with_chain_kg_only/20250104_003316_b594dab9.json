      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Drug of choice for bleeding oesophageal varices is?\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Ethanolamine oleate\nopb. Octreotide\nopc. Propanolol\nopd. Phytonadione\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Bleeding oesophageal varices\" -> \"requires urgent management\" -> \"octreotide is a vasoactive drug\" -> \"reduces portal pressure\" -> \"decreases bleeding risk\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Bleeding oesophageal varices\" -> \"common in portal hypertension\" -> \"octreotide is effective in this condition\" -> \"reduces splanchnic blood flow\" -> \"controls bleeding\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Bleeding oesophageal varices\" -> \"variceal hemorrhage management\" -> \"octreotide is recommended\" -> \"improves outcomes in acute bleeding\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Bleeding oesophageal varices\" -> \"variceal bleeding treatment options\" -> \"ethanolamine oleate is used for sclerotherapy\" -> \"not first-line for acute bleeding\" -> \"lower confidence in acute management\" -> 70%\nCHAIN: \"Bleeding oesophageal varices\" -> \"phytonadione is vitamin K\" -> \"used for coagulopathy\" -> \"not specific for variceal bleeding\" -> \"lower confidence in efficacy\" -> 60%\nCHAIN: \"Bleeding oesophageal varices\" -> \"propranolol is a beta-blocker\" -> \"used for prevention of variceal bleeding\" -> \"not for acute management\" -> \"lower confidence in acute setting\" -> 65%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Bleeding esophageal varices)-CAUSES/COMPLICATES->(Fibrosis)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Genes)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Vitamin K)\n(Bleeding esophageal varices)-CAUSES/PREDISPOSES->(Complication)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(APP gene)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Propranolol)\n(Hypertension, Portal)-CAUSES->(Pathogenesis)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Octreotide)\n(Hypertension, Portal)-PREDISPOSES->(Complication)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Octreotide)\n(Bleeding varices)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Octreotide)\n(Octreotide)-TREATS->(Acute hemorrhage)\n(Vitamin K 1)-ASSOCIATED_WITH/TREATS->(Blood Coagulation Disorders)\n(Bleeding esophageal varices)-CAUSES->(Chronic liver disease NOS)-CAUSES/PREDISPOSES->(Bleeding varices)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"The drug of choice for bleeding oesophageal varices is octreotide. It is a vasoactive drug that reduces portal pressure and splanchnic blood flow, effectively controlling variceal bleeding. Ethanolamine oleate is used for sclerotherapy but is not first-line for acute bleeding management. Propranolol is a beta-blocker used for the prevention of variceal bleeding, not for acute treatment. Phytonadione (vitamin K) is used for coagulopathy but does not specifically address variceal bleeding. Evidence supports octreotide's role in treating acute hemorrhage associated with portal hypertension.\"\n}",
