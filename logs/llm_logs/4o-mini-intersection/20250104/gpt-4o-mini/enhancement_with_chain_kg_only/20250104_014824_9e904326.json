      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Drug of choice for pregnant female suspected of having a baby with congenital adrenal hyperplasia\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Dexamethasone\nopb. Betamethasone\nopc. Hydrocoisone\nopd. Prednisolone\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Congenital adrenal hyperplasia suspected\" -> \"Need to prevent virilization in female fetus\" -> \"Dexamethasone is effective in reducing androgen production\" -> \"Dexamethasone is the drug of choice\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Pregnant female with suspected congenital adrenal hyperplasia\" -> \"Risk of fetal adrenal crisis\" -> \"Hydrocortisone is used for adrenal insufficiency\" -> \"Not the first-line treatment for prevention of virilization\" -> \"Dexamethasone preferred\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Congenital adrenal hyperplasia in pregnancy\" -> \"Dexamethasone reduces fetal androgen exposure\" -> \"Betamethasone primarily used for fetal lung maturity\" -> \"Not indicated for congenital adrenal hyperplasia\" -> \"Dexamethasone is the drug of choice\" -> 92%\nCHAIN: \"Pregnant female with congenital adrenal hyperplasia risk\" -> \"Need to manage hormonal levels\" -> \"Prednisolone is less effective than dexamethasone\" -> \"Dexamethasone is preferred for this condition\" -> 88%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Betamethasone)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-TREATS->(Congenital adrenal hyperplasia)\n(Betamethasone)-ISA->(Glucocorticoids)-TREATS->(Congenital adrenal hyperplasia)\n(Dexamethasone)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Betamethasone)\n(Congenital adrenal hyperplasia)-PREDISPOSES->(Inflammation)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Dexamethasone)\n(Dexamethasone)-INTERACTS_WITH/ISA->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)\n(prednisolone)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Dexamethasone)\n(Congenital adrenal hyperplasia)-CAUSES/PREDISPOSES->(Disease)-ASSOCIATED_WITH/INTERACTS_WITH->(Virus)-LOCATION_OF->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)\n(Hydrocortisone)-PART_OF->(Epidermis)-LOCATION_OF->(First line treatment)\n(Hydrocortisone)-PART_OF->(Mucous Membrane)-LOCATION_OF->(First line treatment)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"In cases of suspected congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) in a pregnant female, the primary goal is to prevent fetal virilization due to excess androgen exposure. Dexamethasone is the drug of choice as it effectively reduces androgen production from the adrenal glands. While hydrocortisone is used for adrenal insufficiency, it is not the first-line treatment for preventing virilization in this context. Betamethasone is primarily indicated for fetal lung maturity and is not recommended for CAH management. Prednisolone is less effective than dexamethasone for this condition. Therefore, the consensus supports that dexamethasone is the preferred treatment for managing suspected CAH in pregnancy.\"\n}",
