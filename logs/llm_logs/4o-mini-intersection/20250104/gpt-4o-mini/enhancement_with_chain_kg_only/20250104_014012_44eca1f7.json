      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Alpha la adrenergic blocker giving symptomatic relief in BPH?\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Tamsulosin\nopb. Prazosin\nopc. Oxazocin\nopd. Dolazoline\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Alpha-1 adrenergic blocker\" -> \"relaxes smooth muscle in the prostate\" -> \"reduces urinary obstruction\" -> \"symptomatic relief in BPH\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Tamsulosin\" -> \"selectively blocks alpha-1A receptors\" -> \"decreases resistance in the prostatic urethra\" -> \"improves urinary flow\" -> \"symptomatic relief in BPH\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Prazosin\" -> \"blocks alpha-1 adrenergic receptors\" -> \"causes vasodilation\" -> \"may improve urinary symptoms\" -> \"less selective for prostate\" -> \"possible symptomatic relief in BPH\" -> 70%\nCHAIN: \"Oxazocin\" -> \"alpha-1 adrenergic blocker\" -> \"relaxes smooth muscle\" -> \"potentially reduces urinary symptoms\" -> \"less commonly used\" -> \"unclear efficacy in BPH\" -> 60%\nCHAIN: \"Dolazoline\" -> \"alpha-2 adrenergic agonist\" -> \"not primarily used for BPH\" -> \"unclear role in urinary symptoms\" -> \"unlikely to provide symptomatic relief in BPH\" -> 50%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Central alpha-2 Adrenergic Agonist [EPC])-PREVENTS->(Inflammation)-PREDISPOSES->(Symptoms)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia)\n(Central alpha-2 Adrenergic Agonist [EPC])-TREATS->(Sleep disturbances)-ISA->(Symptoms)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia)\n(Prazosin)-TREATS->(Hypoxia)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Receptors, Adrenergic, alpha-1)\n(Urinary tract obstruction)-CAUSES->(Symptoms)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia)\n(Prostate)-LOCATION_OF->(Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia)\n(Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia)-CAUSES->(Urinary symptoms)\n(Urinary symptoms)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia)\n(Obstruction)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Interferon-alpha)-CAUSES->(Vasodilation)\n(Urinary tract obstruction)-CAUSES->(Chronic inflammation)-CAUSES->(Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Alpha-1 adrenergic blockers are effective in providing symptomatic relief in Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH) by relaxing smooth muscle in the prostate and urethra, thereby reducing urinary obstruction. Tamsulosin is a selective alpha-1A blocker that specifically decreases resistance in the prostatic urethra, leading to improved urinary flow and significant symptomatic relief in BPH. Prazosin, while an alpha-1 blocker, is less selective for the prostate and primarily used for hypertension, resulting in less consistent relief of urinary symptoms in BPH. Oxazocin is also an alpha-1 blocker but is less commonly used and has unclear efficacy in BPH. Dolazoline, an alpha-2 adrenergic agonist, is not primarily indicated for BPH and is unlikely to provide symptomatic relief. Therefore, Tamsulosin is the most effective option for symptomatic relief in BPH, supported by its mechanism of action and clinical efficacy.\"\n}",
