      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Topical immunomodulator used for the treatment of genital was is:\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Imiquimod\nopb. Podophylline\nopc. Interferon\nopd. Acyclovir\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Topical immunomodulator\" -> \"used for treating genital warts\" -> \"Imiquimod is a topical immunomodulator\" -> \"Imiquimod is indicated for genital warts\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Topical treatments for genital warts\" -> \"include immunomodulators\" -> \"Podophylline is a topical treatment\" -> \"but not an immunomodulator\" -> \"Acyclovir is an antiviral\" -> \"Interferon is not typically used topically\" -> \"Imiquimod is the correct option\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Genital warts treatment options\" -> \"Imiquimod is a topical agent\" -> \"acts as an immunomodulator\" -> \"Podophylline is a cytotoxic agent\" -> \"Acyclovir is for viral infections\" -> \"Interferon is not a topical immunomodulator\" -> \"Imiquimod is the best choice\" -> 85%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Acyclovir)-TREATS->(Complication)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Interferons)\n(Acyclovir)-TREATS->(Abnormal renal function)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Interferons)\n(Interferons)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Macrophages, Peritoneal)-LOCATION_OF->(imiquimod)\n(Antiviral Agents)-CAUSES/PREVENTS->(Complication)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Interferons)\n(imiquimod)-TREATS->(Disease)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Immunity)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Immunologic Adjuvants)\n(imiquimod)-TREATS->(Disease)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Antiinflammatory Effect)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Immunologic Adjuvants)\n(Anogenital venereal warts)-CAUSES->(Obstruction)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(neuropeptide Y|NPY)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Macrophages, Peritoneal)-LOCATION_OF->(imiquimod)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Imiquimod is a topical immunomodulator specifically indicated for the treatment of genital warts, as it enhances the immune response against the human papillomavirus (HPV) responsible for these lesions. The reasoning chains confirm that while Podophylline is a topical treatment, it is not an immunomodulator, and Acyclovir is an antiviral agent not used for genital warts. Interferon is not typically applied topically for this condition. Evidence supporting Imiquimod's role includes its association with immunologic adjuvants and its anti-inflammatory effects, reinforcing its efficacy in treating genital warts.\"\n}",
