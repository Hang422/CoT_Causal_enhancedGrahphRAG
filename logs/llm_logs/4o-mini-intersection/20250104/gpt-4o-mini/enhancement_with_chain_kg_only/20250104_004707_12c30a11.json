      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Biochemistry.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Glycogen storage diseases include all the following except:\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Krabbe's disease\nopb. Fabry's disease\nopc. Fragile syndrome\nopd. All\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Glycogen storage diseases\" -> \"involve abnormal glycogen metabolism\" -> \"include conditions like Pompe disease and McArdle disease\" -> \"Krabbe's disease is a lysosomal storage disorder\" -> \"not classified as a glycogen storage disease\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Glycogen storage diseases\" -> \"are characterized by enzyme deficiencies\" -> \"Fabry's disease is a sphingolipidosis\" -> \"not related to glycogen metabolism\" -> \"therefore not a glycogen storage disease\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Glycogen storage diseases\" -> \"are distinct from other metabolic disorders\" -> \"Fragile X syndrome is a genetic condition\" -> \"not related to glycogen storage\" -> \"thus not a glycogen storage disease\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Glycogen storage diseases\" -> \"include various metabolic disorders\" -> \"Krabbe's disease is not one of them\" -> \"Fabry's disease is also excluded\" -> \"Fragile X syndrome is unrelated\" -> \"therefore, all options are not glycogen storage diseases\" -> 80%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Glycogen storage disease type II)-ISA->(Symptoms)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Globoid cell leukodystrophy)\n(Glycogen storage disease type II)-ISA->(Signs and Symptoms)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Globoid cell leukodystrophy)\n(Glycogen Storage Disease Type V)-CAUSES->(Symptoms)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Globoid cell leukodystrophy)\n(Glycogen Storage Disease Type V)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Functional disorder)-CAUSES->(Globoid cell leukodystrophy)\n(Globoid cell leukodystrophy)-CAUSES/ISA->(Disease)-CAUSES/MANIFESTATION_OF->(Fabry Disease)\n(Fabry Disease)-CAUSES/PREDISPOSES->(Disease)-CAUSES->(Fragile X Syndrome)\n(Fragile X Syndrome)-CAUSES->(Symptoms)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Glycogen Storage Disease)\n(Globoid cell leukodystrophy)-CAUSES->(Disease)-CAUSES->(Symptoms)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Glycogen Storage Disease)\n(Globoid cell leukodystrophy)-ISA->(Metabolic Diseases)-CAUSES->(Symptoms)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Glycogen Storage Disease)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Glycogen storage diseases are a group of inherited metabolic disorders characterized by enzyme deficiencies that lead to abnormal glycogen metabolism. They include conditions such as Pompe disease and McArdle disease. Krabbe's disease is a lysosomal storage disorder, not related to glycogen metabolism, and therefore is not classified as a glycogen storage disease. Similarly, Fabry's disease is a sphingolipidosis and also not related to glycogen metabolism. Fragile X syndrome is a genetic condition that does not involve glycogen storage. Thus, all the options listed (Krabbe's disease, Fabry's disease, and Fragile X syndrome) are not classified as glycogen storage diseases.\"\n}",
