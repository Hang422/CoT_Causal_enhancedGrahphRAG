      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Physiology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Functions of plasmin are all except-\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Fibrinolysis\nopb. Activation of collagenase\nopc. Destruction of VWF\nopd. Stabilization of fibrin\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Plasmin\" -> \"breaks down fibrin\" -> \"promotes fibrinolysis\" -> \"not involved in collagenase activation\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Plasmin\" -> \"degrades fibrin\" -> \"facilitates fibrinolysis\" -> \"does not stabilize fibrin\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Plasmin\" -> \"involved in fibrinolysis\" -> \"does not activate collagenase\" -> \"unclear role in VWF destruction\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Plasmin\" -> \"breaks down fibrin\" -> \"promotes fibrinolysis\" -> \"does not stabilize fibrin\" -> 90%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Fibrin)-CAUSES->(Fibrinolysis)\n(Fibrinolysis)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Fibrin)\n(Plasmin)-CAUSES->(Fibrinolysis)\n(COLLAGENASE)-INTERACTS_WITH->(T-Lymphocyte)-PART_OF->(Cartilage)-LOCATION_OF->(Destruction - action)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Plasmin is a serine protease that primarily functions in fibrinolysis, the process of breaking down fibrin in blood clots. It does not activate collagenase, which is involved in the degradation of collagen, nor does it stabilize fibrin; rather, it promotes its breakdown. Additionally, while plasmin can interact with von Willebrand factor (VWF), its role in the destruction of VWF is not well-defined and is not a primary function. Therefore, the correct answer to the question regarding the functions of plasmin is that it does not activate collagenase or stabilize fibrin.\"\n}",
