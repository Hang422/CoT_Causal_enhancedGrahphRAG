      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Drugs causing hypokalemia are : a) Amphotericin B b) Insulin c) Cyclosporine d) Carbenoxolone e) NSAIDs\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. ace\nopb. ac\nopc. abd\nopd. acd\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Amphotericin B\" -> \"increased renal potassium loss\" -> \"hypokalemia\" -> 95% CHAIN: \"Insulin\" -> \"drives potassium into cells\" -> \"decreased serum potassium\" -> \"hypokalemia\" -> 90% CHAIN: \"Cyclosporine\" -> \"renal vasoconstriction\" -> \"decreased renal blood flow\" -> \"possible hypokalemia\" -> 70% CHAIN: \"Carbenoxolone\" -> \"inhibits mineralocorticoid activity\" -> \"increased potassium excretion\" -> \"hypokalemia\" -> 85% CHAIN: \"NSAIDs\" -> \"inhibit prostaglandin synthesis\" -> \"decreased renal blood flow\" -> \"possible hyperkalemia\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Amphotericin B\" -> \"causes hypokalemia\" -> \"confirmed effect\" -> 95% CHAIN: \"Insulin\" -> \"causes hypokalemia\" -> \"confirmed effect\" -> 90% CHAIN: \"Cyclosporine\" -> \"unclear effect on potassium\" -> \"possible hypokalemia\" -> 70% CHAIN: \"Carbenoxolone\" -> \"causes hypokalemia\" -> \"confirmed effect\" -> 85% CHAIN: \"NSAIDs\" -> \"do not typically cause hypokalemia\" -> \"possible hyperkalemia\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: Confidence in options: - Option a (ace) is correct: Amphotericin B, Insulin, and Carbenoxolone -> 90% - Option b (ac) is incorrect: Insulin and Carbenoxolone only -> 80% - Option c (abd) is incorrect: Cyclosporine is uncertain -> 70% - Option d (acd) is incorrect: NSAIDs do not cause hypokalemia -> 90%\nCHAIN: Final confidence in the correct answer: -> 90%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Cyclosporine)-CAUSES->(Excretory function)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(potassium)\n(Cyclosporine)-CAUSES->(uptake)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(potassium)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Amphotericin B is well-documented to cause hypokalemia due to increased renal potassium loss. Insulin also causes hypokalemia by driving potassium into cells, a confirmed effect. Carbenoxolone inhibits mineralocorticoid activity, leading to increased potassium excretion and hypokalemia. Cyclosporine's effect on potassium is less clear, with some evidence suggesting it may lead to hypokalemia, but this is not as well established. NSAIDs typically do not cause hypokalemia; instead, they can lead to hyperkalemia due to decreased renal blood flow. Therefore, the correct drugs causing hypokalemia are Amphotericin B, Insulin, and Carbenoxolone.\"\n}",
