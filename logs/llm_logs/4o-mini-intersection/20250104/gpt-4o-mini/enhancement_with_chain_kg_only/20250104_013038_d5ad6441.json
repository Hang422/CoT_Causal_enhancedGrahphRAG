      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Drug of choice for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder is:-\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Haloperidol\nopb. Imipramine\nopc. Alprazolam\nopd. Methylphenidate\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) treatment guidelines\" -> \"Stimulant medications are first-line treatments\" -> \"Methylphenidate is a commonly used stimulant\" -> \"Methylphenidate improves attention and reduces hyperactivity\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms\" -> \"Need for effective management options\" -> \"Methylphenidate is FDA-approved for ADHD\" -> \"Methylphenidate is widely prescribed\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Haloperidol is an antipsychotic\" -> \"Not typically used for ADHD\" -> \"Imipramine is a tricyclic antidepressant\" -> \"Not first-line for ADHD\" -> \"Alprazolam is a benzodiazepine\" -> \"Not indicated for ADHD\" -> \"Methylphenidate is the preferred choice\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Methylphenidate is a central nervous system stimulant\" -> \"Effective in increasing attention span\" -> \"Reduces impulsivity in ADHD patients\" -> \"Recommended by clinical guidelines\" -> 92%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Brain activity)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Methylphenidate)\n(Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(physiological aspects)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Methylphenidate)\n(Imipramine)-TREATS->(Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder)\n(Haloperidol)-TREATS->(Disease)-MANIFESTATION_OF/PREDISPOSES->(Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder)\n(Alprazolam)-TREATS->(Disease)-MANIFESTATION_OF/PREDISPOSES->(Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder)\n(Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Brain activity)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Benzodiazepines)\n(Benzodiazepines)-PREDISPOSES/TREATS->(Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder)\n(Methylphenidate)-TREATS->(Disease)-MANIFESTATION_OF/PREDISPOSES->(Hyperactive behavior)\n(Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Brain activity)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors)-ISA->(Antidepressive Agents, Tricyclic)\n(Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Pathogenesis)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Enzymes)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Benzodiazepines)\n(Stimulant)-INTERACTS_WITH/ISA->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Methylphenidate)\n(First line treatment)-TREATS->(Virus)-LOCATION_OF->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Methylphenidate)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Methylphenidate is the drug of choice for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), as it is a central nervous system stimulant that effectively increases attention span and reduces impulsivity, aligning with clinical guidelines that recommend stimulant medications as first-line treatments. Haloperidol, imipramine, and alprazolam are not typically used for ADHD; haloperidol is an antipsychotic, imipramine is a tricyclic antidepressant not recommended as first-line therapy, and alprazolam is a benzodiazepine not indicated for ADHD. Evidence supports that methylphenidate is FDA-approved for ADHD and is widely prescribed, confirming its status as the preferred choice.\"\n}",
