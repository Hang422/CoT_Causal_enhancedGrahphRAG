      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Physiology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Which of the following enzyme is associated with the conversion of androgen to oestrogen in a growing ovarian follicle is:\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Aromatase\nopb. 5 alpha reductase\nopc. Desmolase\nopd. Isomerase\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Androgens\" -> \"conversion to oestrogens\" -> \"involvement of specific enzymes\" -> \"Aromatase is known to catalyze this reaction\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Aromatase\" -> \"converts androgens to oestrogens\" -> \"active in ovarian follicles\" -> \"supports follicular development\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"5 alpha reductase\" -> \"converts testosterone to dihydrotestosterone\" -> \"not involved in oestrogen synthesis\" -> \"not the correct enzyme\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Desmolase\" -> \"involved in steroidogenesis\" -> \"converts cholesterol to pregnenolone\" -> \"not directly involved in androgen to oestrogen conversion\" -> 80%\nCHAIN: \"Isomerase\" -> \"catalyzes structural rearrangements\" -> \"not specifically associated with androgen to oestrogen conversion\" -> \"not the correct enzyme\" -> 75%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Estrogens)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Enzymes)\n(Estrogens)-PART_OF->(Ovarian Follicle)\n(Androgens)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Enzymes)\n(Aromatase)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cells)-INTERACTS_WITH/LOCATION_OF->(Androgens)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Aromatase is the enzyme responsible for the conversion of androgens to estrogens, particularly in the context of ovarian follicles where it plays a crucial role in follicular development. The reasoning chain for Aromatase is supported by its known function in catalyzing this specific reaction, confirming its relevance in the ovarian environment. In contrast, 5 alpha reductase is involved in converting testosterone to dihydrotestosterone and does not participate in estrogen synthesis, while Desmolase is involved in steroidogenesis but not in the direct conversion of androgens to estrogens. Isomerases catalyze structural rearrangements but are not specifically linked to this conversion. Therefore, Aromatase is the correct answer.\"\n}",
