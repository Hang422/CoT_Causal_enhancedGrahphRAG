      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        The treatment of choice for bacterial vaginosis is :\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Clindamycin\nopb. Erythromycin\nopc. Ampicillin\nopd. Metronidazole\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Bacterial vaginosis is a common vaginal infection\" -> \"Treatment is aimed at restoring normal vaginal flora\" -> \"Metronidazole is effective against anaerobic bacteria\" -> \"Metronidazole is the first-line treatment for bacterial vaginosis\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Bacterial vaginosis is caused by an imbalance of vaginal bacteria\" -> \"Clindamycin is also effective against anaerobic bacteria\" -> \"Clindamycin is an alternative treatment for bacterial vaginosis\" -> \"However, Metronidazole is preferred\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Erythromycin is not typically used for bacterial vaginosis\" -> \"Ampicillin is not the first-line treatment\" -> \"Both are less effective compared to Metronidazole\" -> \"Metronidazole remains the treatment of choice\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Bacterial vaginosis is characterized by a specific set of symptoms\" -> \"Metronidazole is well-studied for this condition\" -> \"Clinical guidelines recommend Metronidazole as the primary treatment\" -> 92%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Clindamycin)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Bacterial Vaginosis)\n(Clindamycin)-ISA->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Methotrexate)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Metronidazole)\n(Clindamycin)-ISA->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Adriamycin)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Metronidazole)\n(Bacterial Vaginosis)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Bacteria)-LOCATION_OF->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Methotrexate)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Metronidazole)\n(Bacterial Vaginosis)-PROCESS_OF->(Bacteria)-LOCATION_OF->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Adriamycin)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Metronidazole)\n(Bacteria, Anaerobic)-LOCATION_OF->(Clindamycin)\n(Metronidazole)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-PART_OF->(Cells)-PART_OF->(Mucous Membrane)-LOCATION_OF->(First line treatment)\n(Metronidazole)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-PART_OF->(Cells)-PART_OF->(Skeletal muscle structure)-LOCATION_OF->(First line treatment)\n(First line treatment)-TREATS->(Virus)-LOCATION_OF->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Adriamycin)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Metronidazole)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a common vaginal infection characterized by an imbalance of normal vaginal flora, primarily involving anaerobic bacteria. The first-line treatment for bacterial vaginosis is Metronidazole, which is effective against these anaerobic bacteria and is well-supported by clinical guidelines. Clindamycin is an alternative treatment option but is not preferred as the first-line therapy. Erythromycin and Ampicillin are not typically used for BV and are less effective compared to Metronidazole. Therefore, the treatment of choice for bacterial vaginosis is Metronidazole.\"\n}",
