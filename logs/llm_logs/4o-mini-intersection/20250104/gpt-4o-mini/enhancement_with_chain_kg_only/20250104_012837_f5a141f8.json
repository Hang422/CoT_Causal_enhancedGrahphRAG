      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Physiology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Adrenal insufficiency in not associated with -\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Hyponatremia\nopb. Hyperkalemia\nopc. Hypoglycemia\nopd. Metabolic alkalosis\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Adrenal insufficiency\" -> \"decreased cortisol production\" -> \"increased ACTH levels\" -> \"hyponatremia\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Adrenal insufficiency\" -> \"decreased aldosterone production\" -> \"increased potassium retention\" -> \"hyperkalemia\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Adrenal insufficiency\" -> \"decreased cortisol production\" -> \"impaired gluconeogenesis\" -> \"hypoglycemia\" -> 80%\nCHAIN: \"Adrenal insufficiency\" -> \"decreased aldosterone production\" -> \"sodium loss\" -> \"possible metabolic alkalosis\" -> \"unclear\" -> 60%\nCHAIN: \"Adrenal insufficiency\" -> \"decreased aldosterone production\" -> \"sodium loss\" -> \"not associated with metabolic alkalosis\" -> 75%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Potassium retention)-CAUSES->(hyperkalemia)\n(Corticotropin)-ASSOCIATED_WITH/PREVENTS->(Disease)-CAUSES->(Hyponatremia)\n(Adrenal gland hypofunction)-CAUSES/PREDISPOSES->(Pathogenesis)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Aldosterone)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Adrenal insufficiency is characterized by decreased production of cortisol and aldosterone. This leads to several physiological changes: 1) Hyponatremia occurs due to decreased aldosterone, which normally promotes sodium retention; thus, this option is associated with adrenal insufficiency. 2) Hyperkalemia is a direct result of decreased aldosterone, which normally facilitates potassium excretion; therefore, this option is also associated. 3) Hypoglycemia can occur due to decreased cortisol, which is essential for gluconeogenesis; thus, this option is associated as well. 4) Metabolic alkalosis is not typically associated with adrenal insufficiency; rather, it is more commonly linked to conditions that cause excessive loss of hydrogen ions or volume contraction. Therefore, the correct answer is metabolic alkalosis, as it is not associated with adrenal insufficiency.\"\n}",
