      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Physiology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Which of the following peptides are not produced by the renal system?\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Renin\nopb. Angiotensin I\nopc. Erythropoietin\nopd. 1,25DHCC\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Renin\" -> \"produced by juxtaglomerular cells\" -> \"involved in blood pressure regulation\" -> 100%\nCHAIN: \"Angiotensin I\" -> \"produced from angiotensinogen\" -> \"converted to angiotensin II primarily in the lungs\" -> \"not directly produced by the renal system\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Erythropoietin\" -> \"produced by interstitial fibroblasts in the kidneys\" -> \"stimulates red blood cell production\" -> 100%\nCHAIN: \"1,25DHCC\" -> \"active form of vitamin D\" -> \"produced in the kidneys from calcidiol\" -> 100%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Erythropoietin)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Lymphocyte)-PART_OF->(Kidney)\n(Erythropoietin)-INTERACTS_WITH->(MONONUCLEAR CELLS)-PART_OF->(Kidney)\n(Angiotensin I)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Myocytes, Smooth Muscle)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Angiotensinogen)\n(Angiotensinogen)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cells)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Angiotensin II)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Renin is produced by juxtaglomerular cells in the kidneys and is involved in blood pressure regulation, confirming it is produced by the renal system. Angiotensin I is not directly produced by the kidneys; it is formed from angiotensinogen, which is produced in the liver, and is converted to angiotensin II primarily in the lungs, thus supporting that it is not a renal product. Erythropoietin is produced by interstitial fibroblasts in the kidneys and stimulates red blood cell production, confirming it is a renal product. 1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25DHCC) is the active form of vitamin D produced in the kidneys from calcidiol, confirming it is also a renal product. Therefore, the peptide not produced by the renal system is Angiotensin I.\"\n}",
