      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Drug indicated in case of subarachnoid hemorrhage:\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Nimodipine\nopb. Amlodipine\nopc. Diltiazem\nopd. Verapamil\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Subarachnoid hemorrhage\" -> \"risk of vasospasm\" -> \"need for vasodilator therapy\" -> \"Nimodipine indicated\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Subarachnoid hemorrhage\" -> \"increased intracranial pressure\" -> \"requirement for blood pressure management\" -> \"Nimodipine used to prevent complications\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Subarachnoid hemorrhage\" -> \"vasospasm occurs in 30- -> 70%\nCHAIN: \"Subarachnoid hemorrhage\" -> \"Nimodipine is a calcium channel blocker\" -> \"specifically indicated for cerebral vasospasm\" -> \"improves cerebral blood flow\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Subarachnoid hemorrhage\" -> \"Amlodipine, Diltiazem, and Verapamil are calcium channel blockers\" -> \"not specifically indicated for vasospasm prevention\" -> \"less effective than Nimodipine\" -> 80%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Nimodipine)-TREATS->(Cerebral Vasospasm)\n(Subarachnoid Hemorrhage)-PREDISPOSES->(Complication)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(ACSM3)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Nimodipine)\n(Subarachnoid Hemorrhage)-ISA->(Thrombosis)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(ACSM3)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Nimodipine)\n(Subarachnoid Hemorrhage)-CAUSES->(Extravasation)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(CA2)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Verapamil)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Nimodipine is the drug indicated for subarachnoid hemorrhage due to its specific action as a calcium channel blocker that prevents cerebral vasospasm, a common complication following such hemorrhages. The reasoning chain correctly identifies the risk of vasospasm and the need for vasodilator therapy, confirming that Nimodipine improves cerebral blood flow and is specifically indicated for this purpose. Other options, such as Amlodipine, Diltiazem, and Verapamil, while also calcium channel blockers, are not specifically indicated for vasospasm prevention and are less effective than Nimodipine in this context. Evidence supports that Nimodipine treats cerebral vasospasm, aligning with the consensus that it is the preferred choice in managing complications from subarachnoid hemorrhage.\"\n}",
