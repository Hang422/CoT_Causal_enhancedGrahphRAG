      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Physiology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Which of the following is the best-known metabolic function of the lung\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Inactivation of serotonin\nopb. Conversion of angiotensin–I to angiotensin–II\nopc. Inactivation of bradykinin\nopd. Metabolism of basic drugs by cytochrome P–450 system\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Lungs involved in metabolism\" -> \"Conversion of angiotensin-I to angiotensin-II occurs in lungs\" -> \"Angiotensin-II plays a role in blood pressure regulation\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Lungs have enzymatic activity\" -> \"Inactivation of bradykinin occurs in lungs\" -> \"Bradykinin is a vasodilator\" -> \"Lungs help regulate vascular tone\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Lungs metabolize certain substances\" -> \"Inactivation of serotonin occurs in lungs\" -> \"Serotonin affects mood and vascular function\" -> \"Lungs contribute to serotonin regulation\" -> 80%\nCHAIN: \"Cytochrome P-450 system present in lungs\" -> \"Metabolism of basic drugs occurs\" -> \"Lungs can influence drug pharmacokinetics\" -> \"Less known compared to other functions\" -> 70%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Lung)-LOCATION_OF->(Bradykinin)\n(Bradykinin)-PART_OF->(Arteries)-LOCATION_OF->(Vasodilator Agents)\n(Bradykinin)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Lymphocyte)-PART_OF->(Lung)\n(Bradykinin)-INTERACTS_WITH->(mast cell)-PART_OF->(Lung)\n(Lung)-LOCATION_OF->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)\n(Lung)-LOCATION_OF->(Isosorbide Dinitrate)-ISA->(Vasodilator Agents)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"The best-known metabolic function of the lung is the conversion of angiotensin-I to angiotensin-II, which is a critical step in the renin-angiotensin system that regulates blood pressure. This function is well-established in medical literature, highlighting the lungs' role in cardiovascular physiology. While the lungs also inactivate bradykinin and serotonin, these functions are less prominent compared to the angiotensin conversion. The metabolism of basic drugs by the cytochrome P-450 system in the lungs is recognized but is not as significant as the other functions. Therefore, the most consensus-supported metabolic function of the lung is the conversion of angiotensin-I to angiotensin-II.\"\n}",
