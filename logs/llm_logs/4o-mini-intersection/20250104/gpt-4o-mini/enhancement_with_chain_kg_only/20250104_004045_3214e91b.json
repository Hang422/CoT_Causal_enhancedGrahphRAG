      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Which of the following most often causes cholestatic jaundice:\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. INH\nopb. Erythromycin estolate\nopc. Pyrazinamide\nopd. Ethionamide\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Erythromycin estolate\" -> \"known to cause cholestatic jaundice\" -> \"inhibits bile flow\" -> \"increased bilirubin levels\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"INH\" -> \"associated with hepatotoxicity\" -> \"can cause jaundice\" -> \"not primarily cholestatic\" -> 70%\nCHAIN: \"Pyrazinamide\" -> \"can cause liver dysfunction\" -> \"may lead to jaundice\" -> \"not specifically cholestatic\" -> 65%\nCHAIN: \"Ethionamide\" -> \"can cause liver toxicity\" -> \"may result in jaundice\" -> \"not commonly cholestatic\" -> 60%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Pyrazinamide)-TREATS->(Disease)-CAUSES->(Liver Dysfunction)\n(Pyrazinamide)-TREATS->(Infection)-PREDISPOSES->(Liver Dysfunction)\n(Ethionamide)-PREVENTS->(Complication)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(TNF gene|TNF)-PART_OF->(Liver)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Erythromycin estolate is well-documented to cause cholestatic jaundice due to its mechanism of inhibiting bile flow, leading to increased bilirubin levels. INH (Isoniazid) is associated with hepatotoxicity and can cause jaundice, but it is not primarily cholestatic. Pyrazinamide can lead to liver dysfunction and jaundice, but it is not specifically cholestatic either. Ethionamide can cause liver toxicity and jaundice, but it is not commonly associated with cholestatic jaundice. Therefore, among the options, Erythromycin estolate is the most frequent cause of cholestatic jaundice.\"\n}",
