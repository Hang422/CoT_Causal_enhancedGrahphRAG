      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        The following statements regarding insulin resistance in diabetic patients are true except:\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. It is more common with huminsulin\nopb. It may occur in the presence of infections\nopc. It may be due to antibodies to insulin\nopd. Use of glucocorticoids may be useful in severe cases\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Insulin resistance\" -> \"often associated with type 2 diabetes\" -> \"more common with human insulin\" -> \"true statement\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Insulin resistance\" -> \"can occur during infections\" -> \"true statement\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Insulin resistance\" -> \"may be due to antibodies to insulin\" -> \"possible but not common\" -> \"unclear\" -> 70%\nCHAIN: \"Insulin resistance\" -> \"use of glucocorticoids\" -> \"may worsen insulin resistance\" -> \"not useful in severe cases\" -> 85%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Glucocorticoids)-CAUSES/COMPLICATES->(Insulin Resistance)\n(Diabetes Mellitus, Non-Insulin-Dependent)-Insulin->(Pathogenesis)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Insulin, Regular, Human)\n(Insulin Resistance)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Genes)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Glucocorticoids)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Insulin resistance is commonly associated with type 2 diabetes, and it is indeed more prevalent with human insulin formulations, making option 'opa' a true statement. Insulin resistance can occur during infections, which supports option 'opb' as true. While antibodies to insulin can lead to insulin resistance, this is a rare occurrence, thus option 'opc' is somewhat misleading but not entirely false. However, glucocorticoids are known to exacerbate insulin resistance rather than alleviate it, making option 'opd' incorrect. Therefore, the statement that is false regarding insulin resistance in diabetic patients is 'opd'.\"\n}",
