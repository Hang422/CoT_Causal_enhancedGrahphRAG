      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Pimozide belongs to class of:\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Thiothixanthene\nopb. Phenothiazine\nopc. Butyrophenone\nopd. Diphenyl butyl piperidine\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Pimozide\" -> \"antipsychotic medication\" -> \"belongs to a specific drug class\" -> \"identified as a butyrophenone\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Pimozide\" -> \"used for Tourette syndrome\" -> \"antipsychotic properties\" -> \"classified under butyrophenones\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Pimozide\" -> \"dopamine receptor antagonist\" -> \"similar to other antipsychotics\" -> \"specifically a butyrophenone\" -> 92%\nCHAIN: \"Pimozide\" -> \"not a phenothiazine\" -> \"not a thiothixanthene\" -> \"not a diphenyl butyl piperidine\" -> \"confirmed as a butyrophenone\" -> 93%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Pimozide)-TREATS->(Gilles de la Tourette syndrome)\n(Pimozide)-ISA->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Antipsychotic Agents)\n(Pimozide)-ISA->(Psychotropic Drugs)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Antipsychotic Agents)\n(Pimozide)-ISA->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Dopamine Antagonists)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Pimozide is an antipsychotic medication primarily used to treat Tourette syndrome and is classified as a butyrophenone. This classification is supported by its mechanism as a dopamine receptor antagonist, which is characteristic of butyrophenones. The reasoning chains confirm that Pimozide does not belong to the classes of phenothiazines, thiothixanthenes, or diphenyl butyl piperidines, reinforcing its identification as a butyrophenone. Evidence paths indicating its use in treating Tourette syndrome and its interaction with antipsychotic agents further support this classification.\"\n}",
