      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Drug used in cancer chemotherapy induced vomiting is?\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Aprepitant\nopb. Dexamethasone\nopc. Ondansetrin\nopd. All of the above\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Aprepitant\" -> \"substance P antagonist\" -> \"reduces nausea and vomiting\" -> \"effective in chemotherapy-induced vomiting\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Dexamethasone\" -> \"corticosteroid\" -> \"anti-inflammatory effects\" -> \"reduces nausea in chemotherapy\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Ondansetron\" -> \"5-HT3 receptor antagonist\" -> \"prevents nausea and vomiting\" -> \"commonly used in chemotherapy\" -> 92%\nCHAIN: \"All of the above\" -> \"includes Aprepitant, Dexamethasone, and Ondansetron\" -> \"all effective for chemotherapy-induced vomiting\" -> 93%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Dexamethasone)-INTERACTS_WITH/ISA->(Adrenal Cortex Hormones)\n([D]Nausea and vomiting NOS)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Helicobacter pylori)-LOCATION_OF->(Ascorbic Acid)-ISA->(Pharmacotherapy)\n(Ondansetron)-ISA->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Anti-Anxiety Agents)-INTERACTS_WITH->(5-HT>3< receptor antagonist)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Aprepitant is a substance P antagonist that effectively reduces nausea and vomiting associated with chemotherapy, making it a key agent in managing chemotherapy-induced vomiting. Dexamethasone, a corticosteroid, has anti-inflammatory properties that also help reduce nausea in chemotherapy settings, though it is not primarily an antiemetic. Ondansetron is a well-established 5-HT3 receptor antagonist that is commonly used to prevent nausea and vomiting in chemotherapy patients. Therefore, all three drugs—Aprepitant, Dexamethasone, and Ondansetron—are utilized in the management of chemotherapy-induced vomiting, supporting the option 'All of the above' as the correct answer.\"\n}",
