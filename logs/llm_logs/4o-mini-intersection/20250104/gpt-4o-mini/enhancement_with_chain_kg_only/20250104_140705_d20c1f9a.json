      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Biochemistry.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        During labor and delivery, a specific hormone causes uterine contractions. This hormone is produced in which one of the following anatomical locations?\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Hypothalamus\nopb. Anterior pituitary\nopc. Posterior pituitary\nopd. Adrenal cortex\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Oxytocin\" -> \"stimulates uterine contractions\" -> \"produced in the posterior pituitary\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Uterine contractions\" -> \"facilitated by hormones\" -> \"oxytocin is key hormone\" -> \"produced in the posterior pituitary\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Labor process\" -> \"requires hormonal regulation\" -> \"oxytocin is released\" -> \"from the posterior pituitary\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Hormones during labor\" -> \"oxytocin is crucial\" -> \"originates from the posterior pituitary\" -> 90%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Hormones)-PART_OF->(Pituitary Gland, Posterior)\n(Oxytocin)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cells)-PART_OF->(Pituitary Gland, Posterior)\n(Oxytocin)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cultured Cells)-PART_OF->(Pituitary Gland, Posterior)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Oxytocin is the hormone responsible for stimulating uterine contractions during labor and delivery. It is produced in the hypothalamus and released from the posterior pituitary gland. The reasoning chains consistently indicate that oxytocin is crucial for labor and originates from the posterior pituitary, which aligns with standard medical consensus. The retrieved evidence paths confirm that oxytocin is indeed associated with the posterior pituitary, reinforcing the correct anatomical location of its production. Therefore, the correct answer is that oxytocin is produced in the posterior pituitary.\"\n}",
