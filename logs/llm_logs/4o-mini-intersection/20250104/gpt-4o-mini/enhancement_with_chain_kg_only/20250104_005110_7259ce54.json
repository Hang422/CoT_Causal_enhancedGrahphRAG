      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Dobutamine differs from dopamine in that\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. It has good blood-brain barrier penetrability\nopb. It causes pronounced tachycardia\nopc. It does not activate adrenergic b receptors\nopd. It does not activate peripheral dopaminergic receptors\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Dobutamine is a synthetic catecholamine\" -> \"It primarily stimulates beta-1 adrenergic receptors\" -> \"It has minimal effect on dopamine receptors\" -> \"It does not activate peripheral dopaminergic receptors\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Dopamine is a precursor to norepinephrine\" -> \"It activates both dopaminergic and adrenergic receptors\" -> \"Dobutamine has a different receptor profile\" -> \"It does not activate adrenergic beta receptors\" -> \"This statement is incorrect\" -> 70%\nCHAIN: \"Dobutamine is used primarily for heart failure\" -> \"It increases cardiac output\" -> \"It has less effect on heart rate compared to dopamine\" -> \"It does not cause pronounced tachycardia\" -> 80%\nCHAIN: \"Dobutamine does not cross the blood-brain barrier effectively\" -> \"It has limited central nervous system effects\" -> \"This suggests poor blood-brain barrier penetrability\" -> \"This statement is incorrect\" -> 75%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Dopamine)-INTERACTS_WITH/PART_OF->(Cells)-INTERACTS_WITH/LOCATION_OF->(Adrenergic Receptor)\n(Dopamine)-CAUSES->(Tachycardia)\n(Adrenergic Receptor)-INTERACTS_WITH->(agonists)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Dobutamine)\n(Dobutamine)-TREATS->(Functional disorder)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Receptors, Adrenergic, beta-1)\n(Dobutamine)-TREATS->(cardiac arrhythmia)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Receptors, Adrenergic, beta-1)\n(Norepinephrine)-PART_OF->(Cells)-LOCATION_OF->(Adrenergic Receptor)\n(Norepinephrine)-PREDISPOSES->(Pathogenesis)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Adrenergic Receptor)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Dobutamine is a synthetic catecholamine that primarily stimulates beta-1 adrenergic receptors, leading to increased cardiac output with minimal effect on heart rate compared to dopamine. It does not activate peripheral dopaminergic receptors, which distinguishes it from dopamine, a precursor to norepinephrine that activates both dopaminergic and adrenergic receptors. Importantly, dobutamine does not effectively cross the blood-brain barrier, indicating poor penetrability into the central nervous system. Therefore, the correct statement is that dobutamine does not activate peripheral dopaminergic receptors.\"\n}",
