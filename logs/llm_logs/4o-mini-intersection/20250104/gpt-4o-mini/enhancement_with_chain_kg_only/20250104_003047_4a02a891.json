      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Which of the following does not cause Insulin release-\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Rosiglitazone\nopb. Nateglinide\nopc. Glimipiride\nopd. Tobutamide\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Rosiglitazone\" -> \"activates PPAR-gamma\" -> \"increases insulin sensitivity\" -> \"does not directly stimulate insulin release\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Nateglinide\" -> \"stimulates beta cells\" -> \"increases insulin secretion\" -> \"causes insulin release\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Glimipiride\" -> \"stimulates beta cells\" -> \"increases insulin secretion\" -> \"causes insulin release\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Tolbutamide\" -> \"stimulates beta cells\" -> \"increases insulin secretion\" -> \"causes insulin release\" -> 90%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(insulin sensitivity)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Insulin)\n(rosiglitazone)-PART_OF->(Muscle Fibers)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Adipocytes)-LOCATION_OF->(Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor Gamma, human)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Rosiglitazone activates PPAR-gamma, which primarily increases insulin sensitivity rather than directly stimulating insulin release, confirming it does not cause insulin release. Nateglinide, Glimipiride, and Tolbutamide all stimulate beta cells in the pancreas, leading to increased insulin secretion and thus causing insulin release. Therefore, the correct answer is Rosiglitazone, as it does not directly cause insulin release.\"\n}",
