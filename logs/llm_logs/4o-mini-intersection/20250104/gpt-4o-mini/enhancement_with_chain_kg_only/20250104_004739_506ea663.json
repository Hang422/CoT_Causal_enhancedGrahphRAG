Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        A 9-year-old boy diagnosed as uncomplicated pulmonary tuberculosis. He is put on isoniazid, rifampin, and ethambutol at home after initial treatment given at hospital. Which is accurate statement for this scenario?\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. His 3-year-old sibling should receive INH prophylaxis\nopb. A baseline test of auditory function test is essential before drug treatment is initiated\nopc. Polyahralgia is a potential adverse effect of the drugs the boy is taking\nopd. His mother, who takes care of him, does not need INH prophylaxis\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"The boy has uncomplicated pulmonary tuberculosis\" -> \"He is on isoniazid, rifampin, and ethambutol\" -> \"Isoniazid can cause tuberculosis transmission risk\" -> \"His 3-year-old sibling is at risk\" -> \"His 3-year-old sibling should receive INH prophylaxis\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"The boy is on ethambutol\" -> \"Ethambutol can cause optic neuritis\" -> \"Auditory function is not primarily affected by these drugs\" -> \"A baseline auditory function test is not essential\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"The boy is on isoniazid and rifampin\" -> \"These drugs can cause side effects\" -> \"Polyarthralgia is a known potential adverse effect\" -> \"Polyarthralgia is a potential adverse effect of the drugs the boy is taking\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"The mother is not infected with tuberculosis\" -> \"She is not at risk of developing tuberculosis\" -> \"She does not need INH prophylaxis\" -> \"His mother, who takes care of him, does not need INH prophylaxis\" -> 90%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(isoniazid)-CAUSES/TREATS->(Tuberculosis)\n(Ethambutol)-TREATS->(Optic Neuritis)\n(Ethambutol)-TREATS->(Disease)-CAUSES/PREDISPOSES->(Pathogenesis)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(MT1JP|NCAPG2)-INTERACTS_WITH->(isoniazid)\n(Tuberculosis, Pulmonary)-MANIFESTATION_OF/PREDISPOSES->(Pathogenesis)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(NPM1 gene|NPM1)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Ethambutol)\n(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Lipopolysaccharides)-PART_OF->(Entire nerve)-LOCATION_OF->(Auditory function test)\n(Ethambutol)-TREATS->(Disease)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Hearing)\n(Ethambutol)-TREATS->(Meningitis)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Hearing)\n(isoniazid)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Melatonin)-INTERACTS_WITH/ISA->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)\n(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-PART_OF->(PC12 Cells)-PART_OF->(Entire nerve)-LOCATION_OF->(Auditory function test)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"In the case of a 9-year-old boy with uncomplicated pulmonary tuberculosis on isoniazid, rifampin, and ethambutol, the following points are relevant: 1) His 3-year-old sibling should receive INH prophylaxis as they are at risk of tuberculosis transmission from the boy. 2) A baseline auditory function test is not essential before initiating treatment, as ethambutol primarily poses a risk for optic neuritis rather than auditory issues. 3) Polyarthralgia is not a commonly recognized adverse effect of isoniazid or rifampin; it is more associated with other medications or conditions. 4) If the mother is not infected with tuberculosis, she does not require INH prophylaxis. Therefore, the most accurate statement is that the sibling should receive INH prophylaxis.\"\n}",
