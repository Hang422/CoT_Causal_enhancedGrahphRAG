      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Which of the following antitussive can lead to hallucinations\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Morphine\nopb. Dextromethorphan\nopc. Diphenhydramine\nopd. Aprepitant\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Dextromethorphan\" -> \"NMDA receptor antagonist\" -> \"increased risk of dissociative effects\" -> \"possible hallucinations\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Diphenhydramine\" -> \"anticholinergic properties\" -> \"CNS effects including confusion\" -> \"possible hallucinations\" -> 80%\nCHAIN: \"Morphine\" -> \"opioid receptor agonist\" -> \"CNS depression\" -> \"possible altered mental status\" -> \"possible hallucinations\" -> 70%\nCHAIN: \"Aprepitant\" -> \"substance P/neurokinin 1 receptor antagonist\" -> \"not commonly associated with hallucinations\" -> \"unlikely to cause hallucinations\" -> 20%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Diphenhydramine)-ISA->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Anticholinergic Agents)\n(Morphine)-INTERACTS_WITH/ISA->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Opioids)\n(Dextromethorphan)-PREVENTS->(Seizures)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Competitive inhibition)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(NMDA receptor antagonist)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Dextromethorphan is an NMDA receptor antagonist, which can lead to dissociative effects and possible hallucinations, making it a significant risk factor for this side effect. Diphenhydramine, an anticholinergic agent, can also cause CNS effects, including confusion and hallucinations, though this is less common. Morphine, an opioid receptor agonist, primarily causes CNS depression and altered mental status, which can include hallucinations, but this is less frequent compared to the other two. Aprepitant, a substance P/neurokinin 1 receptor antagonist, is not commonly associated with hallucinations and is unlikely to cause this effect. Therefore, the antitussives most likely to lead to hallucinations are Dextromethorphan and Diphenhydramine.\"\n}",
