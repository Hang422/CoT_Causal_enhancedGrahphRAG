      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        A 52 year old male presents to his physician with a chief complaint of a substantial increase in the size of his breasts over the past few months. Three months ago he was diagnosed with hypeension, and placed on antihypeensive medication. Which of the following medications was most likely prescribed?\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Captopril\nopb. Furosemide\nopc. Hydrochlorothiazide\nopd. Spironolactone\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"52 year old male with gynecomastia\" -> \"possible hormonal imbalance\" -> \"antihypertensive medication could cause side effects\" -> \"Spironolactone is known to cause gynecomastia\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Patient diagnosed with hypertension\" -> \"prescribed antihypertensive medication\" -> \"medications can have side effects\" -> \"Spironolactone can lead to breast tissue enlargement\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Antihypertensive medication prescribed\" -> \"possible side effects include gynecomastia\" -> \"Spironolactone is a potassium-sparing diuretic\" -> \"known to cause breast enlargement in males\" -> 80%\nCHAIN: \"Patient presents with enlarged breasts\" -> \"consider medications that can cause this effect\" -> \"Spironolactone is a common antihypertensive\" -> \"associated with gynecomastia\" -> 75%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Spironolactone)-PREVENTS/TREATS->(Symptoms)-CAUSES->(Hypertrophy of Breast)\n(Spironolactone)-ASSOCIATED_WITH/CAUSES->(Gynecomastia)\n(Potassium Sparing Diuretics)-INTERACTS_WITH/ISA->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-CAUSES->(Hypertrophy of Breast)\n(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-CAUSES->(Adaptive Immunity)-PROCESS_OF->(Breast tissue sample)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"The patient, a 52-year-old male with a recent diagnosis of hypertension and significant breast enlargement (gynecomastia), is most likely prescribed Spironolactone. This potassium-sparing diuretic is known to cause gynecomastia as a side effect due to its anti-androgenic properties. The reasoning chains correctly identify Spironolactone as a common antihypertensive associated with breast tissue enlargement. Other antihypertensive medications like Captopril, Furosemide, and Hydrochlorothiazide are less commonly linked to gynecomastia. The evidence paths confirm that Spironolactone is associated with breast hypertrophy, supporting its role in this patient's condition.\"\n}",
