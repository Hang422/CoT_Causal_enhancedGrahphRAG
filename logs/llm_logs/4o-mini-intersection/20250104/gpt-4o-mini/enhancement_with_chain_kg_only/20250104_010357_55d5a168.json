      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Physiology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Plasma membrane of cell is bounded to cytoskeleton by which of the following?\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Spectrin\nopb. Ankyrin\nopc. Tubulin\nopd. Laminin\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Plasma membrane\" -> \"interacts with cytoskeleton\" -> \"via cytoskeletal proteins\" -> \"Spectrin is a cytoskeletal protein\" -> \"Spectrin binds to membrane\" -> \"provides structural support\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Plasma membrane\" -> \"requires anchoring to cytoskeleton\" -> \"Ankyrin is an anchoring protein\" -> \"Ankyrin connects Spectrin to membrane\" -> \"facilitates membrane-cytoskeleton linkage\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Cytoskeleton\" -> \"composed of various proteins\" -> \"Tubulin is a component of microtubules\" -> \"not directly involved in membrane anchoring\" -> \"less relevant for plasma membrane binding\" -> 70%\nCHAIN: \"Laminin\" -> \"is a component of the extracellular matrix\" -> \"not directly associated with cytoskeleton\" -> \"does not bind plasma membrane to cytoskeleton\" -> \"less likely to be correct\" -> 60%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Cytoskeleton)-PART_OF->(Cells)-INTERACTS_WITH/LOCATION_OF->(Ankyrins)\n(Cytoskeleton)-PART_OF->(Cells)-LOCATION_OF->(Cytoskeletal Proteins)\n(Ankyrins)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cells)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Spectrin)\n(Cytoskeleton)-PART_OF->(Muscle Fibers)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cytoskeletal Proteins)\n(Cytoskeletal Proteins)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cells)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Spectrin)\n(Spectrin)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cells)-PART_OF->(Tissue membrane)\n(Ankyrins)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Erythrocytes)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Spectrin)\n(Proteins)-INTERACTS_WITH/PART_OF->(Cells)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Tubulin)\n(Laminin)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cells)-PART_OF->(Extracellular Matrix)\n(Cytoskeleton)-LOCATION_OF->(Proteins)\n(Cytoskeletal Proteins)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Erythrocytes)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Spectrin)\n(Spectrin)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Lymphocyte)-PART_OF->(Tissue membrane)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"The plasma membrane is anchored to the cytoskeleton primarily through the interaction of Spectrin and Ankyrin. Spectrin is a cytoskeletal protein that provides structural support and is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the plasma membrane. Ankyrin serves as an anchoring protein that connects Spectrin to the membrane, facilitating the linkage between the membrane and the cytoskeleton. Tubulin, while a component of the cytoskeleton, is not directly involved in anchoring the plasma membrane. Laminin is part of the extracellular matrix and does not play a role in this specific membrane-cytoskeleton interaction. Therefore, the most relevant options are Spectrin and Ankyrin, with Ankyrin being essential for linking Spectrin to the membrane.\"\n}",
