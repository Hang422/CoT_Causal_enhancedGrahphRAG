      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        The following drugs have significant drug interactions with digoxin except:\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Cholestyramine\nopb. Thiazide diuretics\nopc. Quinidine\nopd. Amlodipine\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Digoxin\" -> \"known to interact with many drugs\" -> \"Cholestyramine binds to digoxin\" -> \"decreased digoxin absorption\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Digoxin\" -> \"commonly interacts with diuretics\" -> \"Thiazide diuretics can cause electrolyte imbalances\" -> \"increased risk of digoxin toxicity\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Digoxin\" -> \"known to interact with antiarrhythmics\" -> \"Quinidine increases digoxin levels\" -> \"increased risk of toxicity\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Digoxin\" -> \"Amlodipine is a calcium channel blocker\" -> \"does not significantly affect digoxin levels\" -> \"minimal interaction expected\" -> 80%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Cholestyramine)-ISA->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Digoxin)\n(Amlodipine)-ISA->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Digoxin)\n(Digoxin)-INTERACTS_WITH/ISA->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)\n(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(CFP)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cholestyramine)\n(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Digitoxin)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cholestyramine)\n(Cholestyramine)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Enzymes)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Digoxin)\n(Electrolytes)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Digoxin)\n(Thiazide Diuretics)-INTERACTS_WITH/ISA->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Digoxin)\n(Amlodipine)-ISA->(Antihypertensive Agents)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Digoxin)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Digoxin is known to interact with several drugs, leading to significant clinical implications. Cholestyramine binds to digoxin in the gastrointestinal tract, reducing its absorption and leading to decreased digoxin levels, which is a well-documented interaction. Thiazide diuretics can cause electrolyte imbalances, particularly hypokalemia, which increases the risk of digoxin toxicity. Quinidine, an antiarrhythmic, is known to increase digoxin levels, also raising the risk of toxicity. In contrast, Amlodipine, a calcium channel blocker, does not significantly affect digoxin levels, and minimal interaction is expected. Therefore, the drug that has no significant interaction with digoxin is Amlodipine.\"\n}",
