      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Following a myocardial infarct, a 40-year-old man is being treated prophylactically with propranolol. You would be concerned about the use of this drug if the patient also had what comorbid condition\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Glaucoma\nopb. Essential tremor\nopc. Diabetes\nopd. Supraventricular tachycardia\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Propranolol prescribed\" -> \"beta-blocker medication\" -> \"can cause bronchoconstriction\" -> \"concern in patients with asthma\" -> \"possible exacerbation of respiratory issues\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Propranolol prescribed\" -> \"beta-blocker medication\" -> \"can mask hypoglycemia symptoms\" -> \"concern in patients with diabetes\" -> \"risk of unrecognized low blood sugar\" -> 80%\nCHAIN: \"Propranolol prescribed\" -> \"beta-blocker medication\" -> \"can lower heart rate\" -> \"concern in patients with supraventricular tachycardia\" -> \"may worsen bradycardia\" -> 75%\nCHAIN: \"Propranolol prescribed\" -> \"beta-blocker medication\" -> \"not contraindicated in glaucoma\" -> \"can be used cautiously\" -> \"less concern compared to other conditions\" -> 90%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Diabetes)-CAUSES/PREDISPOSES->(hypoglycemia)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Propranolol is a non-selective beta-blocker used for various cardiovascular conditions, including post-myocardial infarction prophylaxis. In patients with diabetes, propranolol can mask the symptoms of hypoglycemia, which poses a significant risk of unrecognized low blood sugar. This is a critical concern, as timely recognition of hypoglycemia is essential for effective management. In contrast, while propranolol can lower heart rate, it is not contraindicated in patients with supraventricular tachycardia; rather, it may be used to manage this condition. Propranolol is also not contraindicated in glaucoma, as it can be used cautiously. Therefore, the most concerning comorbid condition when prescribing propranolol is diabetes due to the risk of masking hypoglycemia symptoms.\"\n}",
