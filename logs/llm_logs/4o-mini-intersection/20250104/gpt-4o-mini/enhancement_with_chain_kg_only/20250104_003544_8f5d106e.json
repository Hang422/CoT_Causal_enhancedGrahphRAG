      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Folic acid metabolism is inhibited by :  a) Sulfonamides b) Methotrexate c) Nitrous oxide d) Trimethoprim e) 5–Flucytosine\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. acd\nopb. abd\nopc. bde\nopd. ace\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Sulfonamides\" -> \"inhibit bacterial folate synthesis\" -> \"potentially affects human folate metabolism\" -> 70%\nCHAIN: \"Methotrexate\" -> \"inhibits dihydrofolate reductase\" -> \"reduces folate availability\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Nitrous oxide\" -> \"inhibits vitamin B12 function\" -> \"may affect folate metabolism\" -> 60%\nCHAIN: \"Trimethoprim\" -> \"inhibits bacterial dihydrofolate reductase\" -> \"reduces folate synthesis in bacteria\" -> 80%\nCHAIN: \"5-Flucytosine\" -> \"inhibits fungal DNA synthesis\" -> \"does not directly affect folate metabolism\" -> 50%\nCHAIN: \"Sulfonamides\" -> \"inhibit folate synthesis\" -> \"affect folate metabolism\" -> 70% CHAIN: \"Methotrexate\" -> \"inhibits folate metabolism\" -> \"reduces folate levels\" -> 95% CHAIN: \"Nitrous oxide\" -> \"unclear effect on folate metabolism\" -> \"possible inhibition\" -> 50% CHAIN: \"Trimethoprim\" -> \"inhibits folate synthesis\" -> \"affects folate metabolism\" -> 80% CHAIN: \"5-Flucytosine\" -> \"does not inhibit folate metabolism\" -> \"no effect\" -> 70%\nCHAIN: Confidence in the overall assessment: -> 85%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Nitrous Oxide)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(APP gene)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Vitamin B 12)\n(Nitrous Oxide)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Alleles)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Vitamin B 12)\n(Methotrexate)-TREATS->(Hypertension, Pulmonary)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Dihydrofolate Reductase)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Folic acid metabolism is primarily inhibited by Methotrexate and Trimethoprim. Methotrexate inhibits dihydrofolate reductase, leading to reduced folate availability, which is well-established (95% confidence). Trimethoprim also inhibits bacterial dihydrofolate reductase, affecting folate synthesis in bacteria (80% confidence). Sulfonamides inhibit bacterial folate synthesis but do not directly inhibit human folate metabolism (70% confidence). Nitrous oxide's effect on folate metabolism is unclear and not directly supported by consensus (60% confidence). 5-Flucytosine does not inhibit folate metabolism (50% confidence). Therefore, the correct options that inhibit folic acid metabolism are Methotrexate and Trimethoprim, making option 'opb. abd' the most accurate.\"\n}",
