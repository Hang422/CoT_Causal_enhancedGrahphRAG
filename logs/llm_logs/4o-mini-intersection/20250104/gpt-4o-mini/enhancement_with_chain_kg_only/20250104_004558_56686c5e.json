      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Valproic acid causes all EXCEPT\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. It is an enzyme inducer\nopb. It causes obesity\nopc. It causes Hirsutism\nopd. It causes neural tube defects\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Valproic acid\" -> \"known to cause weight gain\" -> \"associated with obesity\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Valproic acid\" -> \"can cause hirsutism\" -> \"increased hair growth in women\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Valproic acid\" -> \"known teratogen\" -> \"associated with neural tube defects\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Valproic acid\" -> \"not an enzyme inducer\" -> \"it is an enzyme inhibitor\" -> 80%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Valproic Acid)-ASSOCIATED_WITH/TREATS->(Disease)-CAUSES->(Hirsutism)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Valproic acid is known to cause weight gain, which is associated with obesity, thus option (opb) is correct. It can also cause hirsutism, as increased hair growth in women is a recognized side effect, supporting option (opc). Additionally, valproic acid is a known teratogen and is associated with neural tube defects, confirming option (opd). However, option (opa) is incorrect; valproic acid is not an enzyme inducer but rather an enzyme inhibitor, which contradicts the claim in the chain. Therefore, the correct answer to the question is that valproic acid causes all EXCEPT option (opa).\"\n}",
