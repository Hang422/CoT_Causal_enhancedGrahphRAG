      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Which of the following causes retinal pigmentation?\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Quinine\nopb. Chloroquine\nopc. Mefloquine\nopd. Atovaquone\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Chloroquine\" -> \"retinal toxicity\" -> \"retinal pigmentation changes\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Quinine\" -> \"possible retinal effects\" -> \"unclear impact on pigmentation\" -> 60%\nCHAIN: \"Mefloquine\" -> \"neuropsychiatric side effects\" -> \"no established link to retinal pigmentation\" -> 50%\nCHAIN: \"Atovaquone\" -> \"antimalarial action\" -> \"no known retinal toxicity\" -> 40%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Chloroquine)-PART_OF->(Cells)-PART_OF->(Retina)\n(Chloroquine)-PART_OF->(Antigen-Presenting Cells)-PART_OF->(Retina)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Chloroquine is well-documented to cause retinal toxicity, leading to retinal pigmentation changes, making it the most significant option for retinal pigmentation among the choices. Quinine has possible retinal effects, but its impact on pigmentation is unclear and less established. Mefloquine is primarily associated with neuropsychiatric side effects and has no established link to retinal pigmentation. Atovaquone is known for its antimalarial action but has no known retinal toxicity. Therefore, the most consensus-supported cause of retinal pigmentation is Chloroquine.\"\n}",
