      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Patients on isoniazid which vitamin deficiency is more likely to be seen.\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Vitamin B9\nopb. Vitamin B12\nopc. Vitamin B6\nopd. Vitamin B3\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Isoniazid use\" -> \"inhibition of pyridoxine metabolism\" -> \"decreased vitamin B6 levels\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Isoniazid administration\" -> \"interference with vitamin B6\" -> \"risk of peripheral neuropathy\" -> 80%\nCHAIN: \"Isoniazid treatment\" -> \"increased demand for vitamin B6\" -> \"potential deficiency\" -> 75%\nCHAIN: \"Isoniazid\" -> \"affects vitamin B6 metabolism\" -> \"more likely to see vitamin B6 deficiency\" -> 90%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(isoniazid)-TREATS->(Disease)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(uptake)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(pyridoxine)\n(pyridoxine)-ASSOCIATED_WITH/TREATS->(Peripheral Neuropathy)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Isoniazid is known to interfere with the metabolism of vitamin B6 (pyridoxine), leading to decreased levels and an increased risk of deficiency. This is particularly relevant as vitamin B6 is crucial for various metabolic processes, and its deficiency can result in peripheral neuropathy. The reasoning chains consistently indicate that isoniazid affects vitamin B6 metabolism, with a high likelihood of deficiency observed in patients. Therefore, the most likely vitamin deficiency seen in patients on isoniazid is vitamin B6.\"\n}",
