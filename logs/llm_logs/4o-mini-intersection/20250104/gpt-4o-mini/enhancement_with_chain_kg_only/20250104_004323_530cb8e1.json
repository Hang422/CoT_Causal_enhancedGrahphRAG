      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Hypothyroidism is caused by which of the following anti-tubercular drug -\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. PAS\nopb. Ethionamide\nopc. Cycloserine\nopd. Pyrazinamide\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Ethionamide\" -> \"inhibits thyroid hormone synthesis\" -> \"decreased levels of T3 and T4\" -> \"hypothyroidism\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"PAS\" -> \"interferes with thyroid function\" -> \"possible decrease in thyroid hormone production\" -> \"hypothyroidism\" -> 70%\nCHAIN: \"Cycloserine\" -> \"unclear effect on thyroid function\" -> \"no established link to hypothyroidism\" -> \"hypothyroidism unlikely\" -> 40%\nCHAIN: \"Pyrazinamide\" -> \"no direct effect on thyroid hormone synthesis\" -> \"hypothyroidism unlikely\" -> 30%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Thyroxine)-CAUSES/PREDISPOSES->(Hypothyroidism)\n(Triiodothyronine)-PREVENTS/TREATS->(Hypothyroidism)\n(thyroid function)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Thyrotropin)-TREATS->(Hypothyroidism)\n(Ethionamide)-TREATS->(Infection)-MANIFESTATION_OF/PREDISPOSES->(Pathogenesis)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Thyroid Hormones)\n(p-Aminosalicylic Acid)-Aminosalicylic Acid)->(Disease)-CAUSES/COMPLICATES->(Heart failure)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(thyroid function)\n(Cycloserine)-CAUSES->(Symptoms)-ASSOCIATED_WITH/CAUSES->(Heart failure)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(thyroid function)\n(Pyrazinamide)-TREATS->(Infiltration)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Thyroid Hormones)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Ethionamide is known to inhibit thyroid hormone synthesis, leading to decreased levels of T3 and T4, which can result in hypothyroidism. This aligns with the consensus that certain anti-tubercular drugs can affect thyroid function. PAS may interfere with thyroid function, but the evidence is less definitive, suggesting a possible but not established link to hypothyroidism. Cycloserine has no established link to hypothyroidism, and its effects on thyroid function are unclear, making it unlikely to cause hypothyroidism. Pyrazinamide does not have a direct effect on thyroid hormone synthesis and is also unlikely to cause hypothyroidism. Therefore, the most consensus-supported option for causing hypothyroidism among the listed anti-tubercular drugs is Ethionamide.\"\n}",
