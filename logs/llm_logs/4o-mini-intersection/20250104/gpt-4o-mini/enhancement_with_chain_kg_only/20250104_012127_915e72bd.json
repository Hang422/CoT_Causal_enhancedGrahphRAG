      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Physiology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Which is not secreted by stomach?\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Lipase\nopb. Pepsinogens\nopc. HCI\nopd. None\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Stomach secretes pepsinogens\" -> \"Pepsinogens are converted to pepsin\" -> \"Pepsin aids in protein digestion\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Stomach secretes HCl\" -> \"HCl creates acidic environment\" -> \"Acidic environment activates pepsin\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Stomach does not secrete lipase\" -> \"Lipase is primarily secreted by pancreas\" -> \"Lipase aids in fat digestion\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"None implies all listed are secreted\" -> \"Pepsinogens and HCl are secreted\" -> \"Lipase is not secreted\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Lipase is not secreted by stomach\" -> \"Stomach primarily secretes pepsinogens and HCl\" -> \"Therefore, lipase is the correct answer\" -> 90%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Pepsinogens)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cells)-INTERACTS_WITH/LOCATION_OF->(Lipase)\n(Lipase)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Adipocytes)-PART_OF->(Stomach)\n(Lipase)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Lymphocyte)-PART_OF->(Stomach)\n(Stomach)-LOCATION_OF->(Pathogenesis)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Lipase)\n(Stomach)-LOCATION_OF->(Fatty degeneration)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Lipase)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"The stomach secretes pepsinogens and hydrochloric acid (HCl), which are essential for protein digestion. Pepsinogens are converted to pepsin in the acidic environment created by HCl. In contrast, lipase is primarily secreted by the pancreas and is involved in fat digestion, not by the stomach. Therefore, the correct answer is that lipase is not secreted by the stomach.\"\n}",
