      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        In which of the following patients would enalapril be the best first line agent for high blood pressure control ?\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. A 62 year old man with renal artery stenosis\nopb. A 32 year old pregnant female\nopc. A 41 year old woman with hyperkalemia\nopd. A 56 year old diabetic woman\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Enalapril is an ACE inhibitor\" -> \"reduces blood pressure by inhibiting angiotensin II\" -> \"beneficial in diabetic patients\" -> \"56 year old diabetic woman\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Enalapril is contraindicated in renal artery stenosis\" -> \"62 year old man with renal artery stenosis\" -> \"risk of renal failure\" -> \"not suitable\" -> 10%\nCHAIN: \"Enalapril is contraindicated in pregnancy\" -> \"32 year old pregnant female\" -> \"risk of fetal harm\" -> \"not suitable\" -> 5%\nCHAIN: \"Enalapril can increase potassium levels\" -> \"41 year old woman with hyperkalemia\" -> \"risk of worsening hyperkalemia\" -> \"not suitable\" -> 15%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Enalapril)-CAUSES/TREATS->(hyperkalemia)\n(Enalapril)-TREATS->(Disease)-CAUSES->(Renal Artery Stenosis)\n(Enalapril)-TREATS->(Fatty degeneration)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Angiotensin II)\n(Enalapril)-CAUSES->(Abnormal renal function)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Angiotensin II)\n(Enalapril)-TREATS->(Symptoms)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Renal Artery Stenosis)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Enalapril is an ACE inhibitor that is beneficial for managing hypertension, particularly in diabetic patients due to its renal protective effects. In the case of the 56-year-old diabetic woman, enalapril is the best first-line agent as it helps reduce blood pressure and provides renal protection. Conversely, enalapril is contraindicated in patients with renal artery stenosis (62-year-old man) due to the risk of renal failure, in pregnant women (32-year-old female) due to potential fetal harm, and in patients with hyperkalemia (41-year-old woman) as it can exacerbate potassium levels. Therefore, the best option for enalapril use is the diabetic woman.\"\n}",
