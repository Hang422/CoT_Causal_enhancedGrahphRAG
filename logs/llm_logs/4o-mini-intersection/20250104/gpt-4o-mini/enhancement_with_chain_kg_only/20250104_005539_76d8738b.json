      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Biochemistry.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        While going for oxidation in the mitochondria, free fatty acid are transpoed by:\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. None of the above\nopb. Albumin\nopc. Globulins\nopd. Chylomicrons\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Free fatty acids\" -> \"transported in the bloodstream\" -> \"bind to albumin\" -> \"delivered to mitochondria for oxidation\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Free fatty acids\" -> \"released from adipose tissue\" -> \"enter circulation\" -> \"bind to albumin\" -> \"transported to tissues for oxidation\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Free fatty acids\" -> \"require transport proteins\" -> \"albumin is a major transport protein\" -> \"facilitates delivery to mitochondria\" -> 92%\nCHAIN: \"Free fatty acids\" -> \"not transported by globulins\" -> \"not transported by chylomicrons\" -> \"primarily transported by albumin\" -> 88%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Albumins)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Hormones)-PART_OF->(Protoplasm)-LOCATION_OF->(Oxidation)\n(Albumins)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cells)-LOCATION_OF->(Membrane)-LOCATION_OF->(Oxidation)\n(Fatty Acids, Nonesterified)-PREDISPOSES->(Diastasis)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Globulins)\n(Fatty Acids, Nonesterified)-PART_OF->(Lymphocyte)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Globulins)\n(Globulins)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cells)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Chylomicrons)\n(Chylomicrons)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cells)-INTERACTS_WITH/LOCATION_OF->(Albumins)\n(Fatty Acids, Nonesterified)-ASSOCIATED_WITH/PREDISPOSES->(Pathogenesis)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Carrier Proteins)\n(Blood Circulation)-PROCESS_OF->(Organ)-LOCATION_OF->(Albumins)\n(Blood Circulation)-PROCESS_OF->(Entire tibia)-LOCATION_OF->(Albumins)\n(Albumins)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cells)-PART_OF->(Body tissue)\n(Albumins)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Lymphocyte)-PART_OF->(Body tissue)\n(Carrier Proteins)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cells)-INTERACTS_WITH/LOCATION_OF->(Albumins)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Free fatty acids are primarily transported in the bloodstream bound to albumin, which facilitates their delivery to tissues, including the mitochondria, for oxidation. The reasoning chains correctly highlight that free fatty acids bind to albumin after being released from adipose tissue and enter circulation for transport. Globulins and chylomicrons do not play a significant role in the transport of free fatty acids for mitochondrial oxidation. Therefore, the correct answer is that free fatty acids are transported by albumin.\"\n}",
