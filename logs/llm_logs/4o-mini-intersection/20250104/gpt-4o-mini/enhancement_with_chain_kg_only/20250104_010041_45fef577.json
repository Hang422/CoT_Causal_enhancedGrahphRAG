      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Which of the following dings is not used for anxiety?\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Propanolol\nopb. Aiprazolam\nopc. Buspirone\nopd. Haloperidol\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Propranolol\" -> \"used for performance anxiety\" -> \"reduces physical symptoms of anxiety\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Alprazolam\" -> \"benzodiazepine medication\" -> \"commonly prescribed for anxiety disorders\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Buspirone\" -> \"anxiolytic medication\" -> \"used for generalized anxiety disorder\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Haloperidol\" -> \"antipsychotic medication\" -> \"not primarily used for anxiety\" -> \"used for schizophrenia and acute psychosis\" -> 80%\nCHAIN: \"Haloperidol\" -> \"not indicated for anxiety treatment\" -> \"conflicts with common anxiety treatment guidelines\" -> 75%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Propranolol)-TREATS->(Anxiety)\n(Haloperidol)-PREVENTS/TREATS->(Symptoms)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Anxiety)\n(Antipsychotic Agents)-TREATS->(Anxiety)\n(Haloperidol)-INTERACTS_WITH/ISA->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Antipsychotic Agents)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Propranolol is primarily used to manage physical symptoms of anxiety, particularly in performance situations, but is not a first-line treatment for anxiety disorders. Alprazolam is a benzodiazepine commonly prescribed for anxiety disorders, making it a standard treatment option. Buspirone is an anxiolytic specifically indicated for generalized anxiety disorder. Haloperidol, an antipsychotic, is not primarily used for anxiety and is indicated for conditions like schizophrenia and acute psychosis. Therefore, Haloperidol is the drug not used for anxiety treatment.\"\n}",
