      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Levamisole is used as all except -\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Single dose in ascariasis\nopb. Immunostimulant\nopc. Paralysis of worms by depolarisation\nopd. Immunodepressant in high doses\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Levamisole is an anthelmintic\" -> \"used for treating ascariasis\" -> \"single dose effective\" -> \"not used as immunodepressant\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Levamisole acts as an immunostimulant\" -> \"enhances immune response\" -> \"not typically used as immunodepressant\" -> \"high doses can have immunosuppressive effects\" -> 75%\nCHAIN: \"Levamisole causes paralysis of worms\" -> \"through depolarization mechanism\" -> \"effective against certain helminths\" -> \"not primarily used as immunodepressant\" -> 80%\nCHAIN: \"Levamisole is used in high doses\" -> \"can lead to immunosuppression\" -> \"not its primary indication\" -> \"conflicting uses in different contexts\" -> 70%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Levamisole)-TREATS->(Ascariasis)\n(Levamisole)-TREATS->(Infection)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Immunity)\n(Levamisole)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Prodigiozan)-PART_OF->(Cells)-PART_OF->(Myocardium)-LOCATION_OF->(Therapeutic immunosuppression)\n(Levamisole)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Prodigiozan)-PART_OF->(Cells)-PART_OF->(Biopsy sample)-LOCATION_OF->(Therapeutic immunosuppression)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Levamisole is primarily an anthelmintic used to treat ascariasis, typically administered in a single dose. It acts as an immunostimulant by enhancing the immune response, although high doses can lead to immunosuppressive effects, which is not its primary indication. Levamisole causes paralysis of worms through a depolarization mechanism, making it effective against certain helminths. However, it is not used as an immunodepressant in clinical practice. Therefore, the correct answer is that Levamisole is not used as an immunodepressant in high doses, as this contradicts its primary therapeutic role.\"\n}",
