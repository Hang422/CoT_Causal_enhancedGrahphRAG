      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Physiology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Growth hormone has its effect on growth through?\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Directly\nopb. IG1-1\nopc. Thyroxine\nopd. Intranuclear receptors\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Growth hormone\" -> \"stimulates liver to produce IGF-1\" -> \"IGF-1 promotes growth in tissues\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Growth hormone\" -> \"binds to receptors on target cells\" -> \"activates signaling pathways\" -> \"increased cell proliferation\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Growth hormone\" -> \"influences metabolism\" -> \"increased protein synthesis\" -> \"enhanced growth\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Growth hormone\" -> \"directly affects growth plates\" -> \"stimulates chondrocyte activity\" -> \"increased bone length\" -> 80%\nCHAIN: \"Growth hormone\" -> \"interacts with intranuclear receptors\" -> \"modulates gene expression\" -> \"increased growth factors\" -> 70%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Somatotropin)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cells)-INTERACTS_WITH/LOCATION_OF->(Insulin-Like Growth Factor I)-Like Growth Factor I)\n(Somatotropin)-INTERACTS_WITH->(T-Lymphocyte)-INTERACTS_WITH->(receptor)\n(Somatotropin)-ISA->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(receptor)\n(Somatotropin)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cultured Cells)-PART_OF->(Epiphysial cartilage)\n(Somatotropin)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Germ Cells)-PART_OF->(Epiphysial cartilage)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Growth hormone (GH) primarily exerts its effects on growth through the stimulation of the liver to produce Insulin-like Growth Factor 1 (IGF-1), which promotes growth in various tissues, particularly in bone and cartilage. GH binds to specific receptors on target cells, activating signaling pathways that lead to increased cell proliferation and protein synthesis, contributing to enhanced growth. While GH can influence metabolism and has some direct effects on growth plates, its primary mechanism is through IGF-1. The notion of GH interacting with intranuclear receptors is less direct; GH primarily acts through membrane-bound receptors rather than directly modulating gene expression via intranuclear receptors. Therefore, the most accurate option reflecting the consensus is that growth hormone has its effect on growth through IGF-1 production.\"\n}",
