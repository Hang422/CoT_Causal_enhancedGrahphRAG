      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Mark the true statement regarding use of Lithium in maniac-depressive psychosis?\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Monotherapy for acute episodes\nopb. Monitoring of serum concentration is not useful for guiding dose adjustment\nopc. Can result in leucocytosis\nopd. Can result in hypehyroidism on long term use\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Lithium is used in bipolar disorder\" -> \"Effective for acute manic episodes\" -> \"Can be used as monotherapy\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Monitoring serum concentration is standard practice\" -> \"Guides dose adjustment\" -> \"Important for efficacy and safety\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Lithium can affect blood cell counts\" -> \"Leucocytosis is a possible side effect\" -> \"Not commonly reported\" -> 70%\nCHAIN: \"Long-term use of Lithium can affect thyroid function\" -> \"Hypothyroidism is a known risk\" -> \"Hyperthyroidism is less common\" -> 75%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Lithium)-PREDISPOSES/TREATS->(Hypothyroidism)\n(Lithium)-ASSOCIATED_WITH/CAUSES->(Adverse effects)\n(thyroid function)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Thyrotropin)-TREATS->(Hypothyroidism)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Lithium is a first-line treatment for acute manic episodes in bipolar disorder and can be used as monotherapy, making option (a) true. Monitoring serum concentration of lithium is crucial for guiding dose adjustments to ensure efficacy and safety, contradicting option (b). While lithium can affect blood cell counts, leucocytosis is not a common side effect, which makes option (c) less reliable. Long-term use of lithium is associated with hypothyroidism, and while hyperthyroidism can occur, it is less common; thus, option (d) is misleading. Therefore, the correct statement regarding the use of lithium in manic-depressive psychosis is that it can be used as monotherapy for acute episodes.\"\n}",
