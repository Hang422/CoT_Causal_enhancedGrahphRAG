Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Vitamin D is synthesized in the skin and can also be obtained from dietary sources. It is metabolized in the liver to 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (calcifediol), which is the primary circulating form of Vitamin D. The conversion of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (calcitriol), the active form of Vitamin D, occurs in the kidneys and is catalyzed by the enzyme 1-alpha-hydroxylase. This step is considered the rate-limiting step in the activation of Vitamin D. Therefore, the correct answer to the question regarding the rate-limiting enzyme in Vitamin D synthesis is 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol, as it reflects the active form produced through the action of 1-alpha-hydroxylase. Evidence supporting this includes the role of the kidneys in the conversion process and the identification of 1-alpha-hydroxylase as the key enzyme involved.\"\n}",
