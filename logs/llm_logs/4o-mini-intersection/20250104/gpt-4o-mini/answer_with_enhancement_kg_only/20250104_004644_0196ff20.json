Ototoxicity\nopb. Nephrotoxicity\nopc. Coasting effect\nopd. Pulmonary fibrosis\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nCisplatin is known to cause ototoxicity, which can lead to hearing loss, and nephrotoxicity, resulting in renal impairment. The coasting effect is not associated with Cisplatin but rather with other chemotherapeutic agents, confirming that it does not produce this side effect. Additionally, while pulmonary fibrosis is not typically linked to Cisplatin, it is more commonly associated with other drugs, such as bleomycin. Therefore, the correct answer is that Cisplatin does not produce the coasting effect.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

Ototoxicity can lead to hearing loss, while nephrotoxicity can cause renal impairment. The 'coasting effect' is not associated with Cisplatin; it is more relevant to other chemotherapeutic agents. Pulmonary fibrosis is also not a common side effect of Cisplatin, as it is more typically linked to drugs like bleomycin.
