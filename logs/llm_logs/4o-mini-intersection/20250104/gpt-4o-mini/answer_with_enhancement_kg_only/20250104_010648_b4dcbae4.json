Xylose\nopb. Mannose\nopc. Glucose\nopd. Ribose\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nAmong the options provided, glucose is the only sugar that is actively transported in the intestine against a concentration gradient. This process is facilitated by sodium-glucose transporters (SGLT), which allow glucose to be absorbed even when its concentration is lower in the intestinal lumen compared to the inside of the intestinal cells. In contrast, xylose and mannose are absorbed passively and do not primarily utilize active transport mechanisms, while ribose is not significantly absorbed in the intestine due to limited dietary sources. Therefore, the correct answer is glucose, as it is the most common sugar absorbed against a concentration gradient.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"In the human intestine, glucose is absorbed through an active transport mechanism that involves sodium-glucose transporters (SGLT). This allows glucose to be taken up against its concentration gradient, which is a key physiological process. Other sugars listed, such as xylose and mannose, are primarily absorbed via passive diffusion and do not utilize active transport mechanisms to the same extent. Ribose, while a sugar, is not significantly absorbed in the intestine due to limited dietary sources. Therefore, based on established physiological principles, glucose is the only sugar among the options that is absorbed against a concentration gradient. This aligns with the enhanced information provided, confirming that glucose is the correct answer.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opc\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
