Alpha IEN\nopb. Beta IFN\nopc. Gamma IFN\nopd. Natalizumab\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nFor relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS), the standard first-line treatment is Beta Interferon (Beta IFN), which is widely accepted in clinical guidelines due to its efficacy in reducing relapse rates and improving long-term outcomes. Natalizumab is effective for severe cases but is not considered a first-line treatment for all patients. Gamma Interferon (Gamma IFN) is not commonly used in RRMS due to limited evidence supporting its efficacy. Therefore, the drug of choice for RRMS is Beta IFN, as it aligns with established medical consensus.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"In the management of relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS), the first-line treatment options are typically Beta Interferon (Beta IFN) and Glatiramer acetate. Beta IFN is well-supported by clinical guidelines and has a strong evidence base for reducing relapse rates and delaying disease progression. While Natalizumab is effective and used in more severe cases or when other treatments fail, it is not considered a first-line therapy for all patients with RRMS. Gamma Interferon is not commonly used in this context due to insufficient evidence. Therefore, based on established medical consensus, the drug of choice for RRMS is Beta IFN.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}",
