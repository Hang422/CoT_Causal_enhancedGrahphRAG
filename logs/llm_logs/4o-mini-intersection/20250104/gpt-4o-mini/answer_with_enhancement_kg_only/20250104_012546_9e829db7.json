Streptomycin\nopb. Ethambutol\nopc. Capreomycin\nopd. Rifampicin\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nIn evaluating the antitubercular drugs for use in severe renal failure: \n\n1. **Streptomycin**: This drug is primarily excreted by the kidneys, leading to potential accumulation and toxicity in patients with severe renal failure. Therefore, it is not recommended for use in this population. \n\n2. **Ethambutol**: Ethambutol is partially renally excreted, and while dose adjustment is necessary in renal failure, it can be used with caution. This aligns with clinical guidelines suggesting careful monitoring and dose modification. \n\n3. **Capreomycin**: Similar to streptomycin, capreomycin is excreted by the kidneys and poses a risk of nephrotoxicity, making it not recommended in patients with severe renal impairment. \n\n4. **Rifampicin**: Rifampicin is primarily metabolized by the liver with minimal renal excretion, making it generally safe for use in patients with renal failure. \n\nIn summary, Ethambutol can be used with caution with dose adjustments, and Rifampicin is considered safe in severe renal failure, while Streptomycin and Capreomycin are not recommended due to the risk of toxicity.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"In evaluating the antitubercular drugs for use in patients with severe renal failure, we consider the pharmacokinetics and safety profiles of each option. Streptomycin and Capreomycin are both primarily excreted by the kidneys, which increases the risk of accumulation and toxicity in patients with renal impairment, making them unsuitable for use in severe renal failure. Ethambutol is partially renally excreted and can be used with caution, provided that dose adjustments are made based on renal function. However, Rifampicin is primarily metabolized by the liver and has minimal renal excretion, making it generally safe for use in patients with severe renal failure. Therefore, while Ethambutol can be used with caution, Rifampicin is the safest option in this context. Based on this analysis, the most appropriate choice is Rifampicin.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}",
