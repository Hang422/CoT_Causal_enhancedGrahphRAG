Chlorpropamide\nopb. Glibenclamide\nopc. Glicazide\nopd. Glipizide\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nChlorpropamide is an oral hypoglycemic agent that stimulates insulin release and lowers blood glucose levels. Importantly, it also has antidiuretic effects, making it effective in treating diabetes insipidus. In contrast, Glibenclamide, Glicazide, and Glipizide are all sulfonylureas that primarily stimulate insulin secretion to lower blood glucose but do not have any known effects on diabetes insipidus. Therefore, among the options provided, only Chlorpropamide is used to treat both diabetes mellitus and diabetes insipidus.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "
