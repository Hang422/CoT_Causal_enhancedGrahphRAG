Single dose in ascariasis\nopb. Immunostimulant\nopc. Paralysis of worms by depolarisation\nopd. Immunodepressant in high doses\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nLevamisole is primarily an anthelmintic used to treat ascariasis, typically administered in a single dose. It acts as an immunostimulant by enhancing the immune response, although high doses can lead to immunosuppressive effects, which is not its primary indication. Levamisole causes paralysis of worms through a depolarization mechanism, making it effective against certain helminths. However, it is not used as an immunodepressant in clinical practice. Therefore, the correct answer is that Levamisole is not used as an immunodepressant in high doses, as this contradicts its primary therapeutic role.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Levamisole is primarily known as an anthelmintic agent used to treat infections such as ascariasis, typically administered in a single dose (option opa). It also acts as an immunostimulant, enhancing the immune response (option opb). The mechanism of action involves causing paralysis of worms through depolarization (option opc). However, while high doses of Levamisole can lead to immunosuppressive effects, it is not used clinically as an immunodepressant (option opd). Therefore, the statement that Levamisole is used as an immunodepressant in high doses is incorrect, making option opd the best answer. This aligns with the consensus that Levamisole's primary uses do not include immunodepression. Thus, the most accurate answer is option opd.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}",
