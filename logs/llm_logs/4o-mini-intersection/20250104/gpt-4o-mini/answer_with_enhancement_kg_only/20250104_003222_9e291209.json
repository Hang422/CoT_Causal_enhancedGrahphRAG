Directly\nopb. IG1-1\nopc. Thyroxine\nopd. Intranuclear receptors\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nGrowth hormone (GH) primarily exerts its effects on growth through the stimulation of the liver to produce Insulin-like Growth Factor 1 (IGF-1), which promotes growth in various tissues, particularly in bone and cartilage. GH binds to specific receptors on target cells, activating signaling pathways that lead to increased cell proliferation and protein synthesis, contributing to enhanced growth. While GH can influence metabolism and has some direct effects on growth plates, its primary mechanism is through IGF-1. The notion of GH interacting with intranuclear receptors is less direct; GH primarily acts through membrane-bound receptors rather than directly modulating gene expression via intranuclear receptors. Therefore, the most accurate option reflecting the consensus is that growth hormone has its effect on growth through IGF-1 production.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "
