Krabbe's disease\nopb. Fabry's disease\nopc. Fragile syndrome\nopd. All\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nGlycogen storage diseases are a group of inherited metabolic disorders characterized by enzyme deficiencies that lead to abnormal glycogen metabolism. They include conditions such as Pompe disease and McArdle disease. Krabbe's disease is a lysosomal storage disorder, not related to glycogen metabolism, and therefore is not classified as a glycogen storage disease. Similarly, Fabry's disease is a sphingolipidosis and also not related to glycogen metabolism. Fragile X syndrome is a genetic condition that does not involve glycogen storage. Thus, all the options listed (Krabbe's disease, Fabry's disease, and Fragile X syndrome) are not classified as glycogen storage diseases.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Glycogen storage diseases are specifically related to enzyme deficiencies that affect glycogen metabolism. The options provided include Krabbe's disease, which is a lysosomal storage disorder, Fabry's disease, which is a sphingolipidosis, and Fragile X syndrome, a genetic condition. None of these conditions are classified as glycogen storage diseases. Therefore, all the options listed are correct in that they do not belong to the category of glycogen storage diseases. The most appropriate answer is 'All' since none of the listed diseases are glycogen storage diseases.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
