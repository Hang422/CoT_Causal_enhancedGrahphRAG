Nimodipine\nopb. Amlodipine\nopc. Diltiazem\nopd. Verapamil\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nNimodipine is the drug indicated for subarachnoid hemorrhage due to its specific action as a calcium channel blocker that prevents cerebral vasospasm, a common complication following such hemorrhages. The reasoning chain correctly identifies the risk of vasospasm and the need for vasodilator therapy, confirming that Nimodipine improves cerebral blood flow and is specifically indicated for this purpose. Other options, such as Amlodipine, Diltiazem, and Verapamil, while also calcium channel blockers, are not specifically indicated for vasospasm prevention and are less effective than Nimodipine in this context. Evidence supports that Nimodipine treats cerebral vasospasm, aligning with the consensus that it is the preferred choice in managing complications from subarachnoid hemorrhage.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Nimodipine is specifically indicated for the prevention of cerebral vasospasm following subarachnoid hemorrhage. This is due to its selective action on cerebral blood vessels, which helps to improve blood flow and reduce the risk of complications associated with vasospasm. Other calcium channel blockers like Amlodipine, Diltiazem, and Verapamil are not indicated for this specific purpose and do not have the same efficacy in preventing vasospasm. Therefore, based on established medical guidelines and consensus, Nimodipine is the best choice for managing patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
