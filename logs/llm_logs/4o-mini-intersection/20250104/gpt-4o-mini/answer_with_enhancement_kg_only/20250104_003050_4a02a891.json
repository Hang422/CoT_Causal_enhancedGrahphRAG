Rosiglitazone\nopb. Nateglinide\nopc. Glimipiride\nopd. Tobutamide\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nRosiglitazone activates PPAR-gamma, which primarily increases insulin sensitivity rather than directly stimulating insulin release, confirming it does not cause insulin release. Nateglinide, Glimipiride, and Tolbutamide all stimulate beta cells in the pancreas, leading to increased insulin secretion and thus causing insulin release. Therefore, the correct answer is Rosiglitazone, as it does not directly cause insulin release.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"In the context of pharmacology and the mechanisms of action of the listed drugs, Rosiglitazone is a thiazolidinedione that primarily works by activating PPAR-gamma, which enhances insulin sensitivity in peripheral tissues rather than directly stimulating the pancreas to release insulin. In contrast, Nateglinide, Glimipiride, and Tolbutamide are all secretagogues that act on the pancreatic beta cells to promote insulin secretion. Therefore, the consensus is clear that Rosiglitazone does not cause insulin release, while the other three options do. This leads to the conclusion that Rosiglitazone is the correct answer to the question.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
