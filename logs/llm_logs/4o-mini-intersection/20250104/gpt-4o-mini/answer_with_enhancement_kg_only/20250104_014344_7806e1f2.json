Stroma\nopb. Corpora albicans\nopc. Corpora lutea\nopd. Mature follicles\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nProgesterone is primarily produced in the ovaries, specifically by the corpus luteum, which forms after ovulation from the mature follicle. The stroma of the ovary serves as supportive tissue and does not primarily produce hormones. The corpora albicans is a degenerated form of the corpus luteum and does not produce significant amounts of progesterone. Mature follicles are involved in ovulation but do not produce progesterone; this function is taken over by the corpus luteum post-ovulation. Therefore, the correct answer is that progesterone production in the ovary is primarily by the corpus lutea.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Progesterone is a key hormone produced in the ovaries, primarily by the corpus luteum, which forms after ovulation from the remnants of the mature follicle. The stroma of the ovary does not produce hormones, and the corpora albicans is a degenerated form of the corpus luteum that does not synthesize significant amounts of progesterone. Mature follicles are responsible for estrogen production prior to ovulation but do not produce progesterone. Therefore, the consensus in the medical community is that the primary site of progesterone production in the ovary is the corpus luteum. This aligns with the enhanced information provided, confirming that the correct answer is the corpus lutea.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opc\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
