Monotherapy for acute episodes\nopb. Monitoring of serum concentration is not useful for guiding dose adjustment\nopc. Can result in leucocytosis\nopd. Can result in hypehyroidism on long term use\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nLithium is a first-line treatment for acute manic episodes in bipolar disorder and can be used as monotherapy, making option (a) true. Monitoring serum concentration of lithium is crucial for guiding dose adjustments to ensure efficacy and safety, contradicting option (b). While lithium can affect blood cell counts, leucocytosis is not a common side effect, which makes option (c) less reliable. Long-term use of lithium is associated with hypothyroidism, and while hyperthyroidism can occur, it is less common; thus, option (d) is misleading. Therefore, the correct statement regarding the use of lithium in manic-depressive psychosis is that it can be used as monotherapy for acute episodes.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Lithium is indeed a first-line treatment for acute manic episodes in bipolar disorder, which supports option (a) as true. Monitoring serum concentration of lithium is essential for ensuring therapeutic levels and avoiding toxicity, making option (b) false. While lithium can affect blood cell counts, it is more commonly associated with leukopenia rather than leucocytosis, which makes option (c) less reliable. Regarding thyroid function, lithium is more frequently linked to hypothyroidism rather than hyperthyroidism, which makes option (d) misleading. Therefore, the most accurate statement is that lithium can be used as monotherapy for acute episodes of manic-depressive psychosis.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}",
