You would be concerned about the use of this drug if the patient also had what comorbid condition\n\n                    ### Options\n                    opa. Glaucoma\nopb. Essential tremor\nopc. Diabetes\nopd. Supraventricular tachycardia\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nPropranolol is a non-selective beta-blocker used for various cardiovascular conditions, including post-myocardial infarction prophylaxis. In patients with diabetes, propranolol can mask the symptoms of hypoglycemia, which poses a significant risk of unrecognized low blood sugar. This is a critical concern, as timely recognition of hypoglycemia is essential for effective management. In contrast, while propranolol can lower heart rate, it is not contraindicated in patients with supraventricular tachycardia; rather, it may be used to manage this condition. Propranolol is also not contraindicated in glaucoma, as it can be used cautiously. Therefore, the most concerning comorbid condition when prescribing propranolol is diabetes due to the risk of masking hypoglycemia symptoms.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Propranolol is a non-selective beta-blocker that can have various effects on different comorbid conditions. In patients with diabetes, one of the significant concerns is that propranolol can mask the symptoms of hypoglycemia, such as tachycardia and tremors, which are critical for recognizing low blood sugar levels. This can lead to severe hypoglycemic episodes if the patient is not aware of their condition. In contrast, propranolol is not contraindicated in patients with glaucoma, essential tremor, or supraventricular tachycardia, and may even be beneficial in managing some of these conditions. Therefore, the most concerning comorbid condition when prescribing propranolol is diabetes due to the risk of unrecognized hypoglycemia. This aligns with the consensus in pharmacology regarding the use of beta-blockers in diabetic patients.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opc\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}",
