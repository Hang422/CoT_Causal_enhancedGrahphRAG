Tolazoline\nopb. Clonidine\nopc. Bismuth\nopd. Oxymetazoline\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nClonidine is an alpha-2 adrenergic agonist primarily used for hypertension management and is not typically used in this test. Tolazoline is an alpha-adrenergic antagonist used in certain vascular conditions but is also not commonly used in this test. Oxymetazoline is a topical decongestant that is commonly used in this test, making it the most relevant option. Bismuth is an antidiarrheal and gastric protectant, which is not related to the test context. Therefore, the best-supported answer is Oxymetazoline.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"In evaluating the options provided, we consider the common uses of each drug. Clonidine is primarily used for hypertension and is not relevant to the test context. Tolazoline, while an alpha-adrenergic antagonist, is not commonly associated with the test in question. Bismuth is used for gastrointestinal issues and does not fit the context of the test. Oxymetazoline, a topical decongestant, is frequently used in nasal tests or procedures, making it the most relevant option. Therefore, based on the consensus and the enhanced information provided, Oxymetazoline is the best-supported answer.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}",
