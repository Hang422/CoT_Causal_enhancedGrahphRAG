Propanolol\nopb. Oral contraceptives\nopc. Reserpine\nopd. Flupenthixol\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nPropranolol is primarily used for anxiety and is not typically associated with depression, making it the least likely to cause depressive symptoms. Oral contraceptives can influence mood due to hormonal changes, and while some users may experience depression, it is not a common side effect. Reserpine is known to deplete monoamines and is associated with depressive symptoms, making it likely to cause depression. Flupenthixol, an antipsychotic, can also lead to depressive symptoms, which is not uncommon. Therefore, the best answer is that depression is not a side effect of Propranolol.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Propranolol is a beta-blocker primarily used for hypertension and anxiety, and it is not commonly associated with depression. While some individuals may experience mood changes, it is not a typical side effect. Oral contraceptives can affect mood due to hormonal fluctuations, and while some users report depressive symptoms, it is not universally experienced. Reserpine is known to deplete monoamines, which can lead to depression, making it likely to cause depressive symptoms. Flupenthixol, an antipsychotic, can also lead to depressive symptoms as a side effect.
