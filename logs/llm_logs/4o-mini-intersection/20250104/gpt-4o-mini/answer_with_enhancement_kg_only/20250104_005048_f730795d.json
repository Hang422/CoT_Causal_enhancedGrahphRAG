B1\nopb. B2\nopc. B6\nopd. B12\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nWernicke's encephalopathy is primarily associated with thiamine (vitamin B1) deficiency. This condition is characterized by neurological symptoms such as confusion and ataxia, which are directly linked to inadequate thiamine levels. Chronic alcoholism is a significant risk factor for this deficiency due to poor nutritional intake and malabsorption syndromes, which can further exacerbate vitamin deficiencies. The reasoning chains consistently point to thiamine as the critical vitamin involved, aligning with established medical consensus. Therefore, the major vitamin deficiency in Wernicke's encephalopathy is vitamin B1.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Wernicke's encephalopathy is a neurological condition that is primarily caused by a deficiency in thiamine, also known as vitamin B1. The symptoms of this condition, which include confusion, ataxia, and ophthalmoplegia, are directly linked to the lack of thiamine in the body. Chronic alcoholism is a common risk factor for this deficiency, as it often leads to poor nutritional intake and malabsorption. The consensus in the medical community strongly supports that thiamine deficiency is the major vitamin deficiency associated with Wernicke's encephalopathy. Therefore, the most likely correct answer is vitamin B1 (option opa).\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
