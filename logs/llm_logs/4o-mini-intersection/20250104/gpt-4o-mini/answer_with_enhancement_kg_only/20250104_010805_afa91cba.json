Collecting duct\nopb. Glomerulus\nopc. Proximal convoluted tubule\nopd. Loop of Henle\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nAldosterone is a hormone secreted by the adrenal glands that primarily regulates sodium and potassium levels in the body. Its main action occurs in the kidneys, specifically at the collecting duct of the nephron, where it promotes sodium reabsorption and increases water retention. This is supported by the consensus that aldosterone targets renal tubules, particularly influencing fluid balance at the collecting duct. Other nephron segments, such as the glomerulus, proximal convoluted tubule, and loop of Henle, are not primary action sites for aldosterone. Therefore, the correct answer is that aldosterone acts at the collecting duct.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Aldosterone is a steroid hormone produced by the adrenal cortex that plays a crucial role in regulating sodium and potassium balance in the body. Its primary site of action is the collecting duct of the nephron, where it promotes sodium reabsorption and potassium excretion. This mechanism is essential for maintaining blood pressure and fluid balance. While aldosterone may have some indirect effects on other parts of the nephron, such as the proximal convoluted tubule, its most significant and direct action occurs at the collecting duct. The other options, including the glomerulus and loop of Henle, are not primary sites of aldosterone action. Therefore, based on established physiological principles and consensus, the correct answer is that aldosterone acts at the collecting duct.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
