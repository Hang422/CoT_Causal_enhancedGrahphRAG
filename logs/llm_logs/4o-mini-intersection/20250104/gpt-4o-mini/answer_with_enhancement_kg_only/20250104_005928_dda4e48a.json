Produced by alpha cells of pancreas\nopb. Two polypeptide chains are bound by disulfide linkages\nopc. Shifts potassium outside the cell\nopd. S.c insulin tl/2 is 60 mins\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nInsulin is a hormone produced by beta cells of the pancreas, not alpha cells, making option a incorrect. Insulin consists of two polypeptide chains connected by disulfide linkages, confirming option b as correct. Insulin facilitates the uptake of glucose into cells and actually shifts potassium into the cell, which means option c is incorrect. The half-life of subcutaneous insulin is approximately 60 minutes, supporting option d as correct. Therefore, the true statements regarding insulin are options b and d.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "
