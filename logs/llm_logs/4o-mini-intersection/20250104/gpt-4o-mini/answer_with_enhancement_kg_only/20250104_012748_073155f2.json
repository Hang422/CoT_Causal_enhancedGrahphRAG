Platelet dysfunction\nopb. Aspirin inhibits the action of heparin\nopc. Enhanced hypersensitivity of heparin\nopd. Therapy of heparin cannot be monitored\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nAspirin is an antiplatelet agent that inhibits platelet aggregation, leading to increased risk of bleeding. This effect complicates the management of patients on heparin, which is an anticoagulant that also affects hemostasis. The combination of aspirin and heparin can lead to enhanced bleeding risk, making it inadvisable to use them together. Therefore, the correct reasoning aligns with the understanding that aspirin causes platelet dysfunction, which is a significant concern when a patient is already receiving heparin therapy.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Aspirin is known to inhibit platelet aggregation, which can lead to increased bleeding risk, especially in patients who are already on anticoagulants like heparin. The primary concern with combining these two medications is the potential for enhanced bleeding due to the additive effects on hemostasis. While aspirin does not inhibit the action of heparin directly, its antiplatelet effects can complicate the management of patients on heparin therapy. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is that aspirin causes platelet dysfunction, which is a significant reason for avoiding its use in patients already receiving heparin. The other options do not accurately reflect the pharmacological interactions or effects of aspirin in this context.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}",
