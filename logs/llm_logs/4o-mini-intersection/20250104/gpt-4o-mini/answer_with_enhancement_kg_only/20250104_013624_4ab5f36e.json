Flutamide\nopb. Finasteride\nopc. Prazosin\nopd. Minoxidil\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nFinasteride is a 5α reductase inhibitor that effectively reduces dihydrotestosterone (DHT) levels, which is beneficial in treating both benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH) and male pattern baldness (androgenetic alopecia). The reasoning chains confirm that Finasteride improves urinary symptoms associated with BPH and promotes hair regrowth in male pattern baldness, aligning with established medical consensus. Other options, such as Flutamide, Prazosin, and Minoxidil, do not have this dual indication, making Finasteride the correct choice.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Finasteride is a well-established 5α reductase inhibitor that effectively lowers dihydrotestosterone (DHT) levels. It is clinically proven to treat both benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH) by alleviating urinary symptoms and male pattern baldness (androgenetic alopecia) by promoting hair regrowth. The other options listed do not share this dual indication: Flutamide is an anti-androgen primarily used for prostate cancer, Prazosin is an alpha-1 blocker used for hypertension and BPH, and Minoxidil is a topical treatment for hair loss but not a 5α reductase inhibitor. Therefore, based on established medical knowledge and consensus, Finasteride is the correct answer.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
