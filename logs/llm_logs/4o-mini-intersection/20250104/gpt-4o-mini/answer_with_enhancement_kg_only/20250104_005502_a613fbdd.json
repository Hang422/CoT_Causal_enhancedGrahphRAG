Adenylyl cyclase\nopc. Na+-K+-ATPase\nopd. Galactosyl transferase\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\n5'-nucleotidase, Adenylyl cyclase, and Na+-K+-ATPase are all recognized as enzymatic markers of the plasma membrane, as they are integral to its function and are located at the membrane. In contrast, Galactosyl transferase is primarily located in the Golgi apparatus and is not considered a plasma membrane enzyme. Therefore, Galactosyl transferase is the correct answer as the exception among the options provided.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"To determine which of the listed enzymes is not an enzymatic marker of the plasma membrane, we analyze each option based on their known locations and functions. 5'-nucleotidase, Adenylyl cyclase, and Na+-K+-ATPase are all integral membrane proteins that play significant roles in cellular signaling and ion transport, respectively, and are indeed found in the plasma membrane. In contrast, Galactosyl transferase is primarily associated with the Golgi apparatus, where it is involved in glycosylation processes, rather than being a marker of the plasma membrane. Therefore, based on established physiological knowledge, Galactosyl transferase is the exception among the options provided.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
