Androgen binding protein\nopb. Testosterone\nopc. LH\nopd. FSH\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nSertoli cells are crucial for spermatogenesis and secrete androgen-binding protein (ABP), which binds testosterone and facilitates its action on germ cells. They are stimulated by follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), which promotes spermatogenesis and indirectly influences testosterone levels. While Sertoli cells respond to testosterone, they do not secrete it; rather, testosterone is produced by Leydig cells in response to luteinizing hormone (LH). Therefore, the correct answer regarding what Sertoli cells secrete is androgen-binding protein. Evidence supports the interaction of ABP with testosterone and the role of Sertoli cells in the spermatogenic process.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Sertoli cells play a vital role in the process of spermatogenesis and are known to secrete androgen-binding protein (ABP). This protein binds to testosterone, which is essential for the maturation of sperm cells. While Sertoli cells are influenced by follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and interact with testosterone, they do not produce testosterone themselves; that function is carried out by Leydig cells in response to luteinizing hormone (LH). Therefore, the secretion of androgen-binding protein is the primary function of Sertoli cells, making it the most accurate answer among the options provided. The other options (testosterone, LH, and FSH) are not secreted by Sertoli cells, further supporting that the correct answer is ABP.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
