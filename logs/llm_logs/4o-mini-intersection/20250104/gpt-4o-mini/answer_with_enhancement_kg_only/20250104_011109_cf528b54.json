This results in the production of dilute urine, characterized by low urine osmolality. The standard consensus indicates that urine osmolality in Diabetes insipidus is typically less than 300 mmol/L, aligning with the reasoning chain that states 'urine osmolality <300 mmol/L'. While some chains suggest values below 600 mmol/L or even 900 mmol/L, these are not consistent with the typical clinical presentation of the condition. Therefore, the most accurate option reflecting the consensus is urine osmolality <300 mmol/L.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"In Diabetes insipidus, the primary issue is a deficiency of antidiuretic hormone (ADH), which leads to the kidneys' inability to concentrate urine.

While some sources may suggest values below 600 mmol/L or even 900 mmol/L, these do not accurately reflect the clinical presentation of the condition.
