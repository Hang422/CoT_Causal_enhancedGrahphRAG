Thiamine\nopb. Pyridoxine\nopc. Niacin\nopd. Riboflavin\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nIsoniazid (INH) can induce peripheral neuropathy primarily due to its interference with vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) metabolism, leading to a deficiency. Pyridoxine is crucial for nerve function and its supplementation is recommended to alleviate neuropathy symptoms associated with INH treatment. The consensus supports that pyridoxine supplementation effectively corrects the deficiency and improves neuropathy. Therefore, the most appropriate treatment for INH-induced neuropathy is pyridoxine.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Isoniazid (INH) is known to cause peripheral neuropathy primarily due to its interference with vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) metabolism. This leads to a deficiency of pyridoxine, which is essential for proper nerve function. The consensus in the medical community is that supplementation with pyridoxine is the most effective treatment for alleviating the neuropathy symptoms associated with INH use. Other options such as thiamine, niacin, and riboflavin do not directly address the specific deficiency caused by INH. Therefore, the best-supported option for treating INH-induced neuropathy is pyridoxine (option opb).\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
