Fever\nopb. Peptic ulcer\nopc. Unstable angina\nopd. Myalgia\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nAspirin is contraindicated in peptic ulcer due to its potential to cause gastrointestinal irritation and increase the risk of bleeding, which can exacerbate ulcer conditions. In unstable angina, aspirin is beneficial as it provides cardiovascular protection and is not contraindicated. For myalgia, aspirin is not contraindicated as it can reduce inflammation. However, aspirin is contraindicated in children with fever due to the risk of Reye's syndrome, a serious condition associated with aspirin use in this population. Therefore, the most clear contraindication for aspirin is in peptic ulcer and in children with fever.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Aspirin is known to cause gastrointestinal irritation and increase the risk of bleeding, making it contraindicated in patients with peptic ulcers. In contrast, aspirin is beneficial in unstable angina as it helps prevent clot formation. For myalgia, aspirin can be used to alleviate pain and inflammation. While aspirin is contraindicated in children with fever due to the risk of Reye's syndrome, this specific scenario is not listed in the options provided. Therefore, the most appropriate answer based on the options given is peptic ulcer, as it is a clear contraindication for aspirin use.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}",
