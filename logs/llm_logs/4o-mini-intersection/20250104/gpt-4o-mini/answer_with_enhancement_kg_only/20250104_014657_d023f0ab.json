HDL\nopb. LDL\nopc. VLDL\nopd. Chylomicrons\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nCholesterol is synthesized in the liver and needs to be transported to peripheral tissues. The primary lipoprotein responsible for this transport is Low-Density Lipoprotein (LDL), which delivers cholesterol to cells throughout the body. While Very Low-Density Lipoprotein (VLDL) primarily carries triglycerides, it is converted to LDL after triglyceride removal, further supporting LDL's role in cholesterol transport. High-Density Lipoprotein (HDL) primarily functions to remove excess cholesterol from tissues rather than transport it from the liver. Chylomicrons are involved in transporting dietary lipids rather than liver-derived cholesterol. Therefore, the correct answer is LDL, as it is the main transporter of cholesterol from the liver to peripheral tissues.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Cholesterol transport from the liver to peripheral tissues is primarily mediated by Low-Density Lipoprotein (LDL). While High-Density Lipoprotein (HDL) plays a role in reverse cholesterol transport, removing excess cholesterol from tissues back to the liver, it does not transport cholesterol from the liver to tissues. Very Low-Density Lipoprotein (VLDL) is mainly responsible for transporting triglycerides and is converted to LDL after triglyceride removal, but it is not the primary transporter of cholesterol. Chylomicrons are involved in the transport of dietary lipids rather than liver-derived cholesterol. Therefore, based on established biochemistry principles, LDL is the most accurate answer for the transport of cholesterol from the liver to peripheral tissues.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
