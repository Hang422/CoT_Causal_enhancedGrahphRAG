Meningitis\nopb. Pericarditis\nopc. Ileo-caecal tuberculosis\nopd. Adrenal involvement\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nSteroids are indicated in certain forms of tuberculosis to manage inflammation and prevent complications. In the case of meningitis, steroids are used to reduce inflammation and improve neurological outcomes. For pericarditis, steroids help decrease pericardial inflammation and lower the risk of cardiac complications. However, in ileo-caecal tuberculosis, steroids are not typically indicated due to the risk of exacerbating the infection and worsening the disease. In adrenal involvement, steroids are necessary to address adrenal insufficiency and restore hormonal balance. Therefore, the correct answer is that steroids are not indicated in ileo-caecal tuberculosis.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"In the management of tuberculosis (TB), the use of steroids is indicated in certain forms to mitigate inflammation and prevent complications. In cases of TB meningitis, steroids are crucial for reducing inflammation and improving neurological outcomes. Similarly, in pericarditis associated with TB, steroids help to decrease inflammation and prevent cardiac complications. In adrenal involvement, steroids are necessary to manage adrenal insufficiency. However, in ileo-caecal tuberculosis, the use of steroids is generally contraindicated as they can exacerbate the infection and worsen the disease. Therefore, the consensus in medical literature supports that steroids are not indicated in ileo-caecal tuberculosis, making it the correct answer to the question.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opc\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
