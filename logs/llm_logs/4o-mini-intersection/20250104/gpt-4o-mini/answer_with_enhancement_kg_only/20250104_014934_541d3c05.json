Chloroquine\nopb. Betamethasone\nopc. Chloramphenicol\nopd. Zidovudine\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nChloroquine is primarily used for malaria treatment and is not commonly associated with myopathy, making it a strong candidate for the drug that does not cause myopathy. Betamethasone, a corticosteroid, is known to potentially cause muscle weakness and is associated with myopathy. Chloramphenicol, while an antibiotic, has a rare association with myopathy, making it less likely to be the correct answer. Zidovudine, used for HIV treatment, has a high association with myopathy and muscle damage. Therefore, the best-supported conclusion is that Chloroquine does not cause myopathy.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"In evaluating the options for a drug that does not cause myopathy, we consider the known side effects of each drug. Chloroquine (option a) is primarily used for malaria and is not commonly associated with myopathy, making it a strong candidate. Betamethasone (option b), a corticosteroid, can lead to muscle weakness and is associated with myopathy. Chloramphenicol (option c) has a rare association with myopathy, which makes it less likely to be the correct answer. Zidovudine (option d), used in HIV treatment, is well-documented to cause myopathy and muscle damage. Given this analysis, Chloroquine stands out as the drug least likely to cause myopathy, aligning with the enhanced information provided. Therefore, the best-supported conclusion is that Chloroquine does not cause myopathy.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}",
