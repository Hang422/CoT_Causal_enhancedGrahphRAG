This hormone is:\n\n                    ### Options\n                    opa. Endothelial growth factor (EGF)\nopb. Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG)\nopc. Human chorionic somatotropin (HCS)\nopd. Relaxin\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nThe placenta secretes several hormones during pregnancy, with human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) being the primary hormone utilized for early pregnancy detection. hCG is specifically produced by the placenta shortly after implantation and its levels rise significantly in early pregnancy. This hormone is detected in urine tests, which confirm pregnancy. The reasoning chains consistently highlight that hCG is the key hormone for pregnancy detection, supported by evidence showing its association with early pregnancy and its interaction with renal tissue during urinalysis. Other options, such as endothelial growth factor (EGF), human chorionic somatotropin (HCS), and relaxin, do not play a role in early pregnancy detection, making hCG the correct answer.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "
