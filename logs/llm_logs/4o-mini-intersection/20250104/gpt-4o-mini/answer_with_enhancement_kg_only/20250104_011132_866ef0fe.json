It is more common with huminsulin\nopb. It may occur in the presence of infections\nopc. It may be due to antibodies to insulin\nopd. Use of glucocorticoids may be useful in severe cases\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nInsulin resistance is commonly associated with type 2 diabetes, and it is indeed more prevalent with human insulin formulations, making option 'opa' a true statement. Insulin resistance can occur during infections, which supports option 'opb' as true. While antibodies to insulin can lead to insulin resistance, this is a rare occurrence, thus option 'opc' is somewhat misleading but not entirely false. However, glucocorticoids are known to exacerbate insulin resistance rather than alleviate it, making option 'opd' incorrect. Therefore, the statement that is false regarding insulin resistance in diabetic patients is 'opd'.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Insulin resistance is a well-documented phenomenon in diabetic patients, particularly in type 2 diabetes. The statements provided can be evaluated as follows: \\n\\n- **Option 'opa'**: It is more common with human insulin. This is true as human insulin can lead to a higher incidence of insulin resistance compared to other formulations. \\n- **Option 'opb'**: It may occur in the presence of infections. This is also true, as infections can induce a state of insulin resistance due to inflammatory cytokines. \\n- **Option 'opc'**: It may be due to antibodies to insulin. While this can occur, it is relatively rare and not a common cause of insulin resistance in the general diabetic population. Thus, this statement is somewhat misleading but not entirely false. \\n- **Option 'opd'**: Use of glucocorticoids may be useful in severe cases. This is incorrect, as glucocorticoids are known to exacerbate insulin resistance rather than alleviate it. \\n\\nGiven this analysis, the statement that is false regarding insulin resistance in diabetic patients is 'opd'. Therefore, the best-supported option is 'opd'.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}",
