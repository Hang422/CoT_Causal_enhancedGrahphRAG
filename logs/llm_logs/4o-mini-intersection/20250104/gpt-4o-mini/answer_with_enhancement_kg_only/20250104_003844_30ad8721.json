Imiquimod\nopb. Podophylline\nopc. Interferon\nopd. Acyclovir\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nImiquimod is a topical immunomodulator specifically indicated for the treatment of genital warts, as it enhances the immune response against the human papillomavirus (HPV) responsible for these lesions. The reasoning chains confirm that while Podophylline is a topical treatment, it is not an immunomodulator, and Acyclovir is an antiviral agent not used for genital warts. Interferon is not typically applied topically for this condition. Evidence supporting Imiquimod's role includes its association with immunologic adjuvants and its anti-inflammatory effects, reinforcing its efficacy in treating genital warts.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The question asks for a topical immunomodulator used for the treatment of genital warts. Among the options provided, Imiquimod (option opa) is well-established as a topical immunomodulator that enhances the immune response against HPV, which is the causative agent of genital warts. Podophylline (option opb) is a topical treatment but is not classified as an immunomodulator; it works by causing tissue destruction rather than modulating the immune response. Interferon (option opc) is not typically used topically for genital warts, and Acyclovir (option opd) is an antiviral medication that is not indicated for the treatment of genital warts. Therefore, the most appropriate and supported answer is Imiquimod, as it aligns with the consensus in medical literature regarding the treatment of genital warts.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
