Interleukin-6\nopb. Interleukin-6 receptor\nopc. Interleukin-5\nopd. Interleukin-5 receptor\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nTocilizumab is a monoclonal antibody that primarily targets the Interleukin-6 receptor (IL-6R). It is used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, a condition characterized by inflammation where Interleukin-6 plays a significant role. The reasoning chain indicating that Tocilizumab inhibits Interleukin-6 is partially correct but more accurately, it binds to the IL-6 receptor, preventing IL-6 from exerting its inflammatory effects. Evidence paths confirm that Tocilizumab interacts with the IL-6 receptor and is effective in modulating immune responses associated with autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis. Therefore, the correct answer is that Tocilizumab is a monoclonal antibody against the Interleukin-6 receptor.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Tocilizumab is a monoclonal antibody that specifically targets the Interleukin-6 receptor (IL-6R). While Interleukin-6 itself is a key cytokine involved in the inflammatory process of rheumatoid arthritis, Tocilizumab's mechanism of action is to bind to the receptor for IL-6, thereby inhibiting its activity. This distinction is crucial as it highlights that Tocilizumab does not directly inhibit IL-6 but rather blocks its receptor, preventing IL-6 from exerting its pro-inflammatory effects. Therefore, the most accurate answer is that Tocilizumab is a monoclonal antibody against the Interleukin-6 receptor. The enhanced information aligns with this understanding, confirming that the primary target of Tocilizumab is indeed the IL-6 receptor. Thus, the best-supported option is opb.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
