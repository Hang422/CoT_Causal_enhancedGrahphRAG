Stomach\nopb. Duodenum\nopc. Ileum\nopd. Duodenum + Jejunum\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nIron absorption primarily occurs in the duodenum, which is the first part of the small intestine. While the jejunum also plays a role in nutrient absorption, the majority of iron is absorbed in the duodenum. This is supported by evidence indicating that the duodenal mucosa is a key site for iron absorption. Therefore, the most accurate answer is that iron is absorbed in the duodenum.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Iron absorption primarily occurs in the duodenum, which is the first section of the small intestine. While the jejunum can also absorb some iron, the duodenum is recognized as the primary site for iron uptake due to its specialized mucosal cells that facilitate this process. The stomach does not absorb iron, and the ileum is more involved in the absorption of other nutrients. Therefore, the best-supported option is that iron is absorbed in the duodenum. Although the jejunum may contribute to iron absorption, the consensus indicates that the duodenum is the key site. Thus, the most accurate answer is 'Duodenum'.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}",
