Endometrial carcinoma\nopc. >Carcinoma in contralateral breast\nopd. >Cataract\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nTamoxifen is associated with several adverse effects. It is well-documented that tamoxifen increases the risk of thromboembolism and endometrial carcinoma, both recognized as significant adverse effects. The risk of carcinoma in the contralateral breast is less clearly defined but is considered a possible adverse effect. Cataract development is also noted but is less commonly associated with tamoxifen use. Therefore, while thromboembolism and endometrial carcinoma are established risks, carcinoma in the contralateral breast and cataract are less definitive. The most accurate conclusion is that cataract is the least commonly linked adverse effect of tamoxifen, making it the correct answer to the question of which adverse effect is not typically associated with its use.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Tamoxifen is a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) commonly used in the treatment of estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer. Its known adverse effects include an increased risk of thromboembolism and endometrial carcinoma, both of which are well-documented in clinical literature. The risk of developing carcinoma in the contralateral breast is also recognized, although it is less frequently emphasized compared to the other two risks. Cataracts have been reported in some studies, but the association is not as strong or as commonly acknowledged as the other adverse effects. Given this context, cataracts are the least commonly linked adverse effect of tamoxifen use, making it the most appropriate answer to the question of which adverse effect is not typically associated with its use.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
