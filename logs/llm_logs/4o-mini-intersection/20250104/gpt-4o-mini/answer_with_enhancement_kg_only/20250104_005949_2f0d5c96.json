Cough suppression\nopb. Anti-emesis\nopc. Miosis\nopd. Truncal rigidity\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nOpioids are known to have several pharmacological actions. They are effective in cough suppression, as they act on the cough center in the brain, confirming that cough suppression is indeed a pharmacological action of opioids. While opioids can cause nausea, they are not primarily used for anti-emesis; however, some opioids may have anti-emetic properties, which can lead to confusion. Miosis, or pupil constriction, is a well-documented effect of opioids, confirming it as a pharmacological action. Truncal rigidity, while a potential side effect of opioids, is not considered a primary pharmacological action. Therefore, the option that is NOT a pharmacological action of opioids is anti-emesis, as it is not their primary use despite some related effects.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "
