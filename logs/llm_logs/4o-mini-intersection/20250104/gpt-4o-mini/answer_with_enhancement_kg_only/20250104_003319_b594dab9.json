Ethanolamine oleate\nopb. Octreotide\nopc. Propanolol\nopd. Phytonadione\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nThe drug of choice for bleeding oesophageal varices is octreotide. It is a vasoactive drug that reduces portal pressure and splanchnic blood flow, effectively controlling variceal bleeding. Ethanolamine oleate is used for sclerotherapy but is not first-line for acute bleeding management. Propranolol is a beta-blocker used for the prevention of variceal bleeding, not for acute treatment. Phytonadione (vitamin K) is used for coagulopathy but does not specifically address variceal bleeding. Evidence supports octreotide's role in treating acute hemorrhage associated with portal hypertension.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

Octreotide is a vasoactive drug that effectively reduces portal pressure and is widely recognized as the drug of choice for managing acute variceal bleeding.
