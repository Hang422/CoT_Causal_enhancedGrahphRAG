Thalamus\nopb. Corpus striatum\nopc. Tegmentum of pons\nopd. Tectum of midbrain\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nThe efferent fibers of the substantia nigra primarily transmit dopamine to the corpus striatum, which is a key structure in the basal ganglia involved in motor control. This is supported by multiple reasoning chains indicating that the substantia nigra's role in dopamine transmission significantly impacts the corpus striatum, which is crucial for movement regulation. The evidence paths confirm that dopamine interacts with structures in the basal ganglia, further emphasizing the importance of the corpus striatum as the main target for dopamine from the substantia nigra. Therefore, the correct answer is the corpus striatum.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The substantia nigra is a critical structure in the brain that plays a significant role in the regulation of movement through its dopaminergic pathways. The efferent fibers of the substantia nigra primarily project to the corpus striatum, which is part of the basal ganglia. This connection is essential for the modulation of motor control and is well-documented in neuroanatomy and physiology literature. While the substantia nigra does have connections to other areas, such as the thalamus and tegmentum, the primary target for its dopaminergic output is the corpus striatum. Therefore, based on established medical knowledge and the enhanced information provided, the most accurate answer is the corpus striatum.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
