Protein linked with glycosidic bond\nopb. Core protein\nopc. Sugar residues are long in carbohydrate poion of glycoprotein\nopd. None\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nGlycoproteins are biomolecules that consist of a protein core linked to carbohydrate moieties via glycosidic bonds. The core protein is essential for the structure and function of glycoproteins, and sugar residues can vary in length, with some being long. Therefore, the characteristics of glycoproteins include: 1) they are proteins linked with glycosidic bonds (option opa), 2) they have a core protein (option opb), and 3) the carbohydrate portion can vary in length, with some sugar residues being long (option opc). Option opd is incorrect as glycoproteins do have defining characteristics.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Glycoproteins are indeed characterized by their structure, which includes a core protein linked to carbohydrate moieties through glycosidic bonds. Each of the options provided reflects a true aspect of glycoproteins: option opa correctly states that they are proteins linked with glycosidic bonds, option opb highlights the presence of a core protein, and option opc notes that the sugar residues can vary in length, with some being long. Since all three options (opa, opb, opc) accurately describe characteristics of glycoproteins, the best-supported option that encompasses the essence of glycoproteins is option opa, as it succinctly captures the fundamental nature of glycoproteins. Therefore, while all options are correct, option opa is the most direct and fundamental characteristic. Option opd is incorrect as glycoproteins do have defining characteristics. Thus, the most likely correct answer is option opa.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}",
