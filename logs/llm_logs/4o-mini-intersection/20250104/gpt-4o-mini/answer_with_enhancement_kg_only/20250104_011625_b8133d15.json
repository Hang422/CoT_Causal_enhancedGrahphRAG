Striated\nopb. Large T tubules\nopc. Troponin system present\nopd. Caldesmon is impoant regulatory protein\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nCardiac muscle is characterized by striated fibers, indicating the presence of sarcomeres, which is consistent with its classification as striated muscle. It contains large T tubules that facilitate calcium entry, essential for excitation-contraction coupling. The troponin system is indeed present in cardiac muscle, playing a crucial role in muscle contraction. However, caldesmon is primarily associated with smooth muscle and is not a significant regulatory protein in cardiac muscle. Therefore, the statement that caldesmon is an important regulatory protein in cardiac muscle is incorrect, making it the exception among the options.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "
