Diclofenac\nopb. Acetaminophen\nopc. Ibuprofen\nopd. Naproxen\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nAcetaminophen is not classified as an NSAID and is known to cause less gastric irritation compared to traditional NSAIDs, making it the least likely to cause gastric irritation among the options. Diclofenac, ibuprofen, and naproxen are all NSAIDs associated with varying degrees of gastric irritation, with diclofenac and naproxen having a higher risk of gastrointestinal side effects. Ibuprofen is also known to cause gastric irritation but to a moderate extent. Therefore, the consensus supports that acetaminophen is the safest option regarding gastric irritation.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The question asks which of the listed medications causes the least gastric irritation. Acetaminophen is not classified as a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) and is known for its minimal gastrointestinal side effects compared to traditional NSAIDs. The other options—diclofenac, ibuprofen, and naproxen—are all NSAIDs and are associated with varying degrees of gastric irritation, with diclofenac and naproxen generally having a higher risk. Ibuprofen is also known to cause gastric irritation but is typically considered to have a lower risk than diclofenac and naproxen. Therefore, based on the consensus that acetaminophen is less irritating to the gastric mucosa than NSAIDs, the best-supported option is acetaminophen. Thus, the answer is opb.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
