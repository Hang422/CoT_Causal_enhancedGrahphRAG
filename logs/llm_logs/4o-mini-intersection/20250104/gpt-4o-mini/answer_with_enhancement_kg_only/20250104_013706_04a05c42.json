Penicillin G\nopb. Tetracycline\nopc. Azithromycin\nopd. Doxycycline\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nThe drug of choice for Treponema pallidum, the causative agent of syphilis, is Penicillin G, which is the first-line treatment and highly effective against this bacterium. Tetracycline and Doxycycline are alternative treatments but are not first-line options; they are less effective than Penicillin G. Azithromycin is also not a first-line treatment and is typically reserved for patients with penicillin allergies. The consensus supports Penicillin G as the primary treatment for syphilis caused by Treponema pallidum.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "
