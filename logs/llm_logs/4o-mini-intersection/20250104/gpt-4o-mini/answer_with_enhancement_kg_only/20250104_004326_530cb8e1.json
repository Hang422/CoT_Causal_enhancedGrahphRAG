PAS\nopb. Ethionamide\nopc. Cycloserine\nopd. Pyrazinamide\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nEthionamide is known to inhibit thyroid hormone synthesis, leading to decreased levels of T3 and T4, which can result in hypothyroidism. This aligns with the consensus that certain anti-tubercular drugs can affect thyroid function. PAS may interfere with thyroid function, but the evidence is less definitive, suggesting a possible but not established link to hypothyroidism. Cycloserine has no established link to hypothyroidism, and its effects on thyroid function are unclear, making it unlikely to cause hypothyroidism. Pyrazinamide does not have a direct effect on thyroid hormone synthesis and is also unlikely to cause hypothyroidism. Therefore, the most consensus-supported option for causing hypothyroidism among the listed anti-tubercular drugs is Ethionamide.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Hypothyroidism can be caused by certain anti-tubercular drugs, and among the options provided, Ethionamide is the most well-documented drug associated with this condition. Ethionamide inhibits thyroid hormone synthesis, leading to decreased levels of T3 and T4, which can result in hypothyroidism. While PAS may have some potential effects on thyroid function, the evidence is not as strong or definitive as that for Ethionamide. Cycloserine and Pyrazinamide do not have established links to hypothyroidism. Therefore, based on the consensus and available evidence, Ethionamide is the most likely cause of hypothyroidism among the listed drugs.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}",
