Tamsulosin\nopb. Prazosin\nopc. Oxazocin\nopd. Dolazoline\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nAlpha-1 adrenergic blockers are effective in providing symptomatic relief in Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH) by relaxing smooth muscle in the prostate and urethra, thereby reducing urinary obstruction. Tamsulosin is a selective alpha-1A blocker that specifically decreases resistance in the prostatic urethra, leading to improved urinary flow and significant symptomatic relief in BPH. Prazosin, while an alpha-1 blocker, is less selective for the prostate and primarily used for hypertension, resulting in less consistent relief of urinary symptoms in BPH. Oxazocin is also an alpha-1 blocker but is less commonly used and has unclear efficacy in BPH. Dolazoline, an alpha-2 adrenergic agonist, is not primarily indicated for BPH and is unlikely to provide symptomatic relief. Therefore, Tamsulosin is the most effective option for symptomatic relief in BPH, supported by its mechanism of action and clinical efficacy.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Alpha-1 adrenergic blockers are known to provide symptomatic relief in Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH) by relaxing smooth muscle in the prostate and urethra. Among the options provided, Tamsulosin (option opa) is a selective alpha-1A blocker that specifically targets the prostatic urethra, leading to improved urinary flow and significant symptomatic relief in BPH. Prazosin (option opb) is an alpha-1 blocker but is less selective for the prostate and is primarily used for hypertension, making it less effective for BPH symptoms. Oxazocin (option opc) is also an alpha-1 blocker but is not commonly used for BPH, and its efficacy is unclear. Dolazoline (option opd) is an alpha-2 adrenergic agonist and is not indicated for BPH. Therefore, Tamsulosin is the most effective and well-supported option for symptomatic relief in BPH, based on its mechanism of action and clinical efficacy.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
