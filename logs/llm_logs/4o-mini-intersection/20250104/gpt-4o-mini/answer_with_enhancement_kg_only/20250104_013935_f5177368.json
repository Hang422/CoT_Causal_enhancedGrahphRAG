Retinol\nopb. Retinal\nopc. Retinoic acids\nopd. All of the above\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nVitamin A exists in several forms, including retinol, retinal, and retinoic acids, all of which are functionally related. Retinol is essential for vision as it is converted to retinal, a key component of rhodopsin, which is crucial for phototransduction. Retinoic acids play significant roles in gene expression by acting as hormones that regulate transcription of target genes. Additionally, all forms of vitamin A support immune function and contribute to skin health, with retinoic acids promoting skin cell turnover. Therefore, the correct answer is 'All of the above' as all forms of vitamin A are involved in these essential biological functions.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Vitamin A is a fat-soluble vitamin that exists in several forms, including retinol, retinal, and retinoic acids. Each of these forms plays distinct but interconnected roles in the body. Retinol is crucial for vision as it is converted into retinal, which is a component of rhodopsin necessary for light detection in the retina. Retinal is essential for the visual cycle, while retinoic acids are involved in regulating gene expression and play roles in cellular differentiation and immune function. Given that all these forms of vitamin A contribute to vital biological functions, the most comprehensive answer is 'All of the above.' Therefore, the correct option is 'opd.'\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
