Abciximab\nopb. Eptifibatide\nopc. Tirofiban\nopd. Prasugrel\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nGp2b3A inhibitors are a class of drugs that prevent platelet aggregation, primarily used in the management of acute coronary syndromes. The main examples of Gp2b3A inhibitors include abciximab, eptifibatide, and tirofiban. In contrast, prasugrel is classified as a thienopyridine antiplatelet agent that works through a different mechanism, specifically by inhibiting the ADP receptor on platelets, and does not inhibit Gp2b3A. Therefore, prasugrel is not a Gp2b3A inhibitor, confirming that the correct answer to the question is option (opd) Prasugrel.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Gp2b3A inhibitors are specifically designed to block the glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor on platelets, which is crucial for platelet aggregation. The main drugs in this class include abciximab, eptifibatide, and tirofiban. Prasugrel, on the other hand, is a thienopyridine that inhibits platelet aggregation through a different mechanism by blocking the ADP receptor, not the Gp2b3A receptor. Therefore, it does not belong to the class of Gp2b3A inhibitors. This clear distinction confirms that the correct answer to the question is option (opd) Prasugrel, as it is not a Gp2b3A inhibitor.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
