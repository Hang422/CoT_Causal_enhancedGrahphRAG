Vitamin B9\nopb. Vitamin B12\nopc. Vitamin B6\nopd. Vitamin B3\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nIsoniazid is known to interfere with the metabolism of vitamin B6 (pyridoxine), leading to decreased levels and an increased risk of deficiency. This is particularly relevant as vitamin B6 is crucial for various metabolic processes, and its deficiency can result in peripheral neuropathy. The reasoning chains consistently indicate that isoniazid affects vitamin B6 metabolism, with a high likelihood of deficiency observed in patients. Therefore, the most likely vitamin deficiency seen in patients on isoniazid is vitamin B6.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Isoniazid is a first-line medication used to treat tuberculosis, but it is known to interfere with the metabolism of vitamin B6 (pyridoxine). This interference can lead to a deficiency of vitamin B6, which is critical for various metabolic processes, including the synthesis of neurotransmitters. The deficiency of vitamin B6 can result in symptoms such as peripheral neuropathy, which is a common side effect seen in patients taking isoniazid. While other vitamin deficiencies can occur, the most well-documented and likely deficiency associated with isoniazid use is vitamin B6. Therefore, based on the consensus in pharmacology and clinical practice, the most likely vitamin deficiency seen in patients on isoniazid is vitamin B6.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opc\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
