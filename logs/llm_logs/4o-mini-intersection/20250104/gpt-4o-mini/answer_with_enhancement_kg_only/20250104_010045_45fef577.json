Propanolol\nopb. Aiprazolam\nopc. Buspirone\nopd. Haloperidol\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nPropranolol is primarily used to manage physical symptoms of anxiety, particularly in performance situations, but is not a first-line treatment for anxiety disorders. Alprazolam is a benzodiazepine commonly prescribed for anxiety disorders, making it a standard treatment option. Buspirone is an anxiolytic specifically indicated for generalized anxiety disorder. Haloperidol, an antipsychotic, is not primarily used for anxiety and is indicated for conditions like schizophrenia and acute psychosis. Therefore, Haloperidol is the drug not used for anxiety treatment.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"In evaluating the options provided, we can categorize the drugs based on their primary uses in relation to anxiety. Propranolol (opa) is often used to manage the physical symptoms of anxiety, particularly in performance anxiety situations, but it is not a first-line treatment for anxiety disorders. Alprazolam (opb) is a benzodiazepine that is widely prescribed for anxiety disorders, making it a standard treatment option. Buspirone (opc) is specifically indicated for generalized anxiety disorder and is recognized as an anxiolytic. Haloperidol (opd), on the other hand, is an antipsychotic medication primarily used for treating schizophrenia and acute psychosis, and it is not indicated for anxiety disorders. Therefore, Haloperidol is the drug that is not used for anxiety treatment. This aligns with the enhanced information provided, which confirms that Haloperidol is not appropriate for anxiety management. Thus, the most likely correct answer is Haloperidol.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
