He has a history of being treated for duodenal ulcer 4 years back. Investigation reveals elevation of gastrin levels. Which of the following statement is true regarding gastrin?\n\n                    ### Options\n                    opa. Secreted by parietal cells of stomach\nopb. Secreted by alpha ceils of pancreas\nopc. Decreases bicarbonate content in pancreatic secretion\nopd. It gets stimulated by endoluminal peptides in stomach\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nGastrin is a hormone secreted by G cells in the gastric mucosa, not by parietal cells. It stimulates gastric acid secretion and increases gastric motility, which can lead to symptoms like indigestion. Elevated gastrin levels can indicate conditions such as gastrinoma or Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. Gastrin secretion is stimulated by the presence of food, particularly peptides and amino acids, which facilitate digestion. Therefore, the correct statement regarding gastrin is that it is not secreted by parietal cells, but rather by G cells, and it is stimulated by endoluminal peptides in the stomach.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Gastrin is a hormone primarily secreted by G cells located in the gastric mucosa, not by parietal cells. The options provided include statements about the secretion and function of gastrin. Option 'opa' is incorrect because it states that gastrin is secreted by parietal cells. Option 'opb' is also incorrect as gastrin is not secreted by alpha cells of the pancreas. Option 'opc' is incorrect because gastrin actually stimulates gastric acid secretion, which would not decrease bicarbonate content in pancreatic secretion. Option 'opd' is correct because gastrin secretion is indeed stimulated by endoluminal peptides in the stomach, which aligns with the known physiological role of gastrin in response to food intake. Therefore, the most accurate statement regarding gastrin is that it gets stimulated by endoluminal peptides in the stomach.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
