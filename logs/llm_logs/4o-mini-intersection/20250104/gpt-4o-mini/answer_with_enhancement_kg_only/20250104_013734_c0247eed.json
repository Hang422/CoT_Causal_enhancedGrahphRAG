Inactivation of serotonin\nopb. Conversion of angiotensin–I to angiotensin–II\nopc. Inactivation of bradykinin\nopd. Metabolism of basic drugs by cytochrome P–450 system\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nThe best-known metabolic function of the lung is the conversion of angiotensin-I to angiotensin-II, which is a critical step in the renin-angiotensin system that regulates blood pressure. This function is well-established in medical literature, highlighting the lungs' role in cardiovascular physiology. While the lungs also inactivate bradykinin and serotonin, these functions are less prominent compared to the angiotensin conversion. The metabolism of basic drugs by the cytochrome P-450 system in the lungs is recognized but is not as significant as the other functions. Therefore, the most consensus-supported metabolic function of the lung is the conversion of angiotensin-I to angiotensin-II.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "
