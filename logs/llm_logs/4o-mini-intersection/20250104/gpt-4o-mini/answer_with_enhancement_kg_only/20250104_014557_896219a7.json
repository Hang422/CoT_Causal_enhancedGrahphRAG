Strongyloidiasis\nopb. Trichomoniasis\nopc. Schistosomiasis\nopd. Rhinosporidiosis\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nPraziquantel is an antiparasitic medication primarily effective against trematodes, particularly schistosomiasis, which is caused by flatworms. The reasoning chain for schistosomiasis is correct and aligns with consensus, as praziquantel is the drug of choice for this condition. In contrast, praziquantel is not effective against nematodes, which are responsible for strongyloidiasis, nor is it indicated for trichomoniasis, a protozoan infection, or rhinosporidiosis, which is caused by a fungus. Therefore, the only correct option for the use of praziquantel is for schistosomiasis.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Praziquantel is an antiparasitic medication that is primarily used to treat infections caused by trematodes (flukes) and cestodes (tapeworms). The most notable use of praziquantel is in the treatment of schistosomiasis, which is caused by various species of Schistosoma, a type of trematode. The enhanced information confirms that praziquantel is the drug of choice for schistosomiasis and clarifies that it is not effective against nematodes (like those causing strongyloidiasis), protozoa (like those causing trichomoniasis), or fungi (like those causing rhinosporidiosis). Therefore, the only correct option for the use of praziquantel is for schistosomiasis, making option 'opc' the best-supported answer.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opc\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
