Outer hair cells in basal area\nopb. Inner hair cells in basal area\nopc. Outer hair cells in apical area\nopd. Inner hair cells in apical area\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nAminoglycosides are known to be ototoxic and primarily affect the outer hair cells in the cochlea, with the most significant damage occurring in the basal area. This is supported by evidence that aminoglycosides disrupt protein synthesis, leading to cell death, particularly in outer hair cells, which are more vulnerable than inner hair cells. The consensus indicates that while both inner and outer hair cells can be affected, the outer hair cells are predominantly impacted, especially in the basal region of the cochlea. Therefore, the correct answer is that aminoglycosides primarily affect the outer hair cells in the basal area.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "
