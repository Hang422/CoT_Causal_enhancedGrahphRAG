Acute renal failure\nopb. Development of antiplatelet antibodies\nopc. Encephalitis secondary to liver dysfunction\nopd. Hemorrhagic stroke\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nFibrinolytic drugs, used in the treatment of acute myocardial infarction, primarily work by dissolving thrombi, which restores blood flow. However, this mechanism significantly increases the risk of bleeding complications, particularly intracranial hemorrhage, which can lead to hemorrhagic stroke. The reasoning chains consistently highlight the increased risk of bleeding associated with fibrinolytic therapy, with estimates of hemorrhagic stroke risk ranging from 75% to 90%. The retrieved evidence paths support the association between fibrinolytic therapy and hemorrhagic stroke, confirming that the most likely adverse effect of fibrinolytic drugs in this context is indeed hemorrhagic stroke. Other options, such as acute renal failure, development of antiplatelet antibodies, and encephalitis secondary to liver dysfunction, are not commonly associated with fibrinolytic therapy and do not align with the established consensus on the adverse effects of these drugs.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "
