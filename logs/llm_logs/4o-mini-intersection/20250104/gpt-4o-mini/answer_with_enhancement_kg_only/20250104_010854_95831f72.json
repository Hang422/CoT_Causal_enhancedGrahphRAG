Vitamin A\nopb. Vitamin B6\nopc. Vitamin B9\nopd. Vitamin B12\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nSubacute combined degeneration of the cord (SACD) is primarily associated with Vitamin B12 deficiency. This condition is characterized by degeneration of the dorsal columns and corticospinal tracts, which are crucial for proprioception and motor function. Vitamin B12 is essential for myelin synthesis, and its deficiency leads to myelin degeneration, resulting in the neurological symptoms observed in SACD. Other vitamin deficiencies, such as Vitamin A, B6, and B9, are not typically linked to this specific condition. Therefore, the consensus strongly supports that SACD is a feature of Vitamin B12 deficiency.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "
