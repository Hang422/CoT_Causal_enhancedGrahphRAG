Bromocriptine\nopb. Levodopa\nopc. Amantadine\nopd. Metoclopramide\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nHyperprolactinemia is primarily caused by dopamine antagonists, which increase prolactin secretion. Metoclopramide is a dopamine antagonist and is known to cause hyperprolactinemia, aligning with the consensus that it increases prolactin levels. In contrast, bromocriptine is a dopamine agonist that decreases prolactin secretion, thus it does not cause hyperprolactinemia. Levodopa, a dopamine precursor, may decrease prolactin levels, and amantadine's effects on prolactin are unclear but generally do not lead to hyperprolactinemia. Therefore, the only option that directly causes hyperprolactinemia is metoclopramide.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Hyperprolactinemia is primarily caused by dopamine antagonists, which lead to increased prolactin secretion. Among the options provided, metoclopramide is a known dopamine antagonist that can cause hyperprolactinemia due to its action on the central nervous system, inhibiting dopamine receptors. In contrast, bromocriptine is a dopamine agonist that reduces prolactin levels, and therefore does not cause hyperprolactinemia. Levodopa, being a precursor to dopamine, typically decreases prolactin levels, and amantadine's effects on prolactin are not well-established but do not commonly lead to hyperprolactinemia. Thus, the most supported option that causes hyperprolactinemia is metoclopramide.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
