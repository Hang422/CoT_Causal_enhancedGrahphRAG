Protein C deficiency\nopb. Protein S deficiency\nopc. Hemophillia\nopd. Antithrombin III deficiency\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nWarfarin-induced skin necrosis is primarily associated with conditions that lead to a deficiency in anticoagulant proteins, particularly Protein C and Protein S. Warfarin inhibits vitamin K-dependent clotting factors, which includes Protein C and Protein S, leading to a transient hypercoagulable state upon initiation of therapy. This can result in skin necrosis, especially in individuals with pre-existing deficiencies. Protein C deficiency is well-documented as a risk factor for skin necrosis due to the lack of this anticoagulant, which is crucial for regulating coagulation. Protein S deficiency also contributes to this risk, as it is a cofactor for Protein C. Hemophilia and Antithrombin III deficiency are not typically associated with warfarin-induced skin necrosis, as they do not directly relate to the mechanisms of vitamin K inhibition and the resultant hypercoagulable state. Therefore, the most relevant options are Protein C deficiency and Protein S deficiency.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Warfarin-induced skin necrosis is primarily associated with deficiencies in anticoagulant proteins, particularly Protein C and Protein S. When warfarin is initiated, it inhibits vitamin K-dependent clotting factors, including Protein C and Protein S, leading to a transient hypercoagulable state. In individuals with Protein C deficiency, this can result in skin necrosis due to the inability to adequately regulate coagulation. Protein S deficiency also poses a risk, as it acts as a cofactor for Protein C. Hemophilia and Antithrombin III deficiency are not directly linked to this phenomenon, as they do not involve the same mechanisms of vitamin K inhibition and resultant hypercoagulability. Therefore, the most relevant options are Protein C deficiency and Protein S deficiency, with Protein C deficiency being the most commonly cited risk factor for warfarin-induced skin necrosis. Given this understanding, the best-supported option is Protein C deficiency.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}",
