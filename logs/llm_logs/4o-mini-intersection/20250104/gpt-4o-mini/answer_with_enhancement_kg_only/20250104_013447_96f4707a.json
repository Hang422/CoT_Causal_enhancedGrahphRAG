Endometrial carcinoma\nopc. >Carcinoma in contralateral breast\nopd. >Cataract\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nTamoxifen is associated with several adverse effects. It is well-documented that tamoxifen increases the risk of thromboembolism and endometrial carcinoma, both of which are recognized adverse effects. The risk of carcinoma in the contralateral breast is considered a possible adverse effect, but it is less clearly established compared to the first two. Cataract development is also noted as a less commonly associated adverse effect. Therefore, while thromboembolism, endometrial carcinoma, and cataract are all linked to tamoxifen use, carcinoma in the contralateral breast is not as definitively established as an adverse effect. Thus, the correct answer to the question is that tamoxifen does not cause carcinoma in the contralateral breast as a well-documented adverse effect.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Tamoxifen is a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) commonly used in the treatment of estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer. It is associated with several adverse effects. The well-documented adverse effects include thromboembolism and endometrial carcinoma, both of which are recognized risks due to tamoxifen's estrogenic effects on the endometrium. Cataracts have also been reported as a potential adverse effect, although they are less commonly discussed. On the other hand, while tamoxifen is used to reduce the risk of contralateral breast cancer, the direct causation of carcinoma in the contralateral breast as an adverse effect is not as clearly established in the literature compared to the other options. Therefore, the most appropriate answer to the question of which adverse effect is not caused by tamoxifen is carcinoma in the contralateral breast, as it is not a well-documented adverse effect. This reasoning aligns with the consensus in the medical community regarding the known risks associated with tamoxifen therapy.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opc\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
