Increased blood pressure caused by nicotine\nopb. Increased skeletal muscle strength caused by neostigmine, an acetycholine esterase inhibitor\nopc. Bradycardia caused by infusion of acetylcholine\nopd. All of these\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nAtropine is a muscarinic receptor antagonist that blocks the effects of acetylcholine at muscarinic receptors. This leads to the prevention of bradycardia caused by acetylcholine infusion, as atropine inhibits the parasympathetic effects that would normally decrease heart rate. However, atropine does not affect nicotinic receptors, meaning that the increased blood pressure caused by nicotine remains unaffected. Additionally, neostigmine, an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, increases acetylcholine levels, enhancing skeletal muscle strength through nicotinic receptor activation, which is also not blocked by atropine. Therefore, only the bradycardia caused by acetylcholine is blocked by atropine, while the effects of nicotine and neostigmine are not. Thus, the correct answer is that atropine blocks bradycardia but does not block the effects of nicotine or neostigmine.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Atropine is a muscarinic receptor antagonist that specifically blocks the action of acetylcholine at muscarinic receptors. In the context of the options provided: 1) Increased blood pressure caused by nicotine is mediated through nicotinic receptors, which are not affected by atropine. 2) Increased skeletal muscle strength caused by neostigmine is also mediated through nicotinic receptors, and thus, atropine would not block this effect either. 3) Bradycardia caused by infusion of acetylcholine is directly related to the action of acetylcholine on muscarinic receptors in the heart, which atropine can effectively block. Therefore, the only effect that can be blocked by atropine is the bradycardia caused by acetylcholine. Hence, the correct answer is that atropine blocks bradycardia but does not block the effects of nicotine or neostigmine. The most supported option is 'opc'.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opc\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}",
