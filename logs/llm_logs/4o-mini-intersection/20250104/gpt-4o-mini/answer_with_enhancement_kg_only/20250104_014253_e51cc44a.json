Tyrosine transaminase\nopb. Tyrosine hydroxylase\nopc. Phenylalanine hydroxylase\nopd. Phenylketonuria hydroxylase\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nPhenylketonuria (PKU) is a genetic disorder caused by a deficiency in the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase, which is responsible for converting phenylalanine to tyrosine. This deficiency leads to the accumulation of phenylalanine in the blood, resulting in various neurological and developmental issues. The reasoning chains consistently point to phenylalanine hydroxylase as the key enzyme affected in PKU, aligning with the consensus that PKU is primarily due to mutations in the gene encoding this enzyme. Evidence paths confirm the association of phenylalanine hydroxylase with phenylketonuria and its role in phenylalanine metabolism, further supporting the conclusion that the correct answer is option (opc) Phenylalanine hydroxylase.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Phenylketonuria (PKU) is a well-established genetic disorder primarily caused by a deficiency in the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase. This enzyme is crucial for the conversion of phenylalanine to tyrosine. When phenylalanine hydroxylase is deficient or non-functional, phenylalanine accumulates in the body, leading to the various neurological and developmental issues associated with PKU. The other options listed (tyrosine transaminase, tyrosine hydroxylase, and phenylketonuria hydroxylase) do not play a direct role in the pathophysiology of PKU. Therefore, the consensus in the medical literature strongly supports that the correct answer is option (opc) Phenylalanine hydroxylase.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opc\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
