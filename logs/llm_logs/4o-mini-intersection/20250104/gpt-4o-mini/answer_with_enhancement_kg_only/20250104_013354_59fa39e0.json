Thiothixanthene\nopb. Phenothiazine\nopc. Butyrophenone\nopd. Diphenyl butyl piperidine\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nPimozide is an antipsychotic medication primarily used to treat Tourette syndrome and is classified as a butyrophenone. This classification is supported by its mechanism as a dopamine receptor antagonist, which is characteristic of butyrophenones. The reasoning chains confirm that Pimozide does not belong to the classes of phenothiazines, thiothixanthenes, or diphenyl butyl piperidines, reinforcing its identification as a butyrophenone. Evidence paths indicating its use in treating Tourette syndrome and its interaction with antipsychotic agents further support this classification.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Pimozide is an antipsychotic medication that is primarily used to treat Tourette syndrome. It is classified as a butyrophenone, which is a class of antipsychotic drugs known for their dopamine receptor antagonism. The other options provided (thiothixanthene, phenothiazine, and diphenyl butyl piperidine) do not accurately describe Pimozide's classification. The enhanced information confirms that Pimozide's mechanism of action aligns with that of butyrophenones, further solidifying this classification. Therefore, the most accurate answer is that Pimozide belongs to the butyrophenone class.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opc\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
