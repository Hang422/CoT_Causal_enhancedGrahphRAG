Hypoglycemia\nopb. Cinchonism\nopc. Arrhythmias\nopd. Sweating\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nThe administration of i.v. quinine can lead to side effects known as Cinchonism, which includes symptoms such as restlessness and sweating. This aligns with the consensus that Cinchonism is a common adverse reaction to quinine due to its central nervous system stimulation. While hypoglycemia and arrhythmias can occur with quinine, they are less directly associated with the specific symptoms of restlessness and sweating. Therefore, the most likely cause of the patient's symptoms is Cinchonism, supported by the reasoning that quinine's pharmacological effects can lead to these specific adverse reactions.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Quinine is known to cause a range of side effects, and one of the most notable is Cinchonism, which includes symptoms such as tinnitus, headache, dizziness, restlessness, and sweating. The symptoms presented by the patient—restlessness and sweating—are characteristic of Cinchonism. While hypoglycemia and arrhythmias can occur with quinine administration, they are not as directly linked to the specific symptoms of restlessness and sweating. Therefore, based on the consensus in pharmacology regarding the side effects of quinine, the most likely cause of the patient's symptoms is Cinchonism.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}",
