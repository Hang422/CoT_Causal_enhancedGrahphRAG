Loxatidine\nopb. Pirenzepine\nopc. Omeprazole\nopd. Famotidine\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nLoxatidine is an H2 receptor antagonist that reduces gastric acid secretion but does not block cholinergic, histaminergic, or gastrin receptors, making it a potential candidate. However, it primarily targets H2 receptors, which may not fully align with the requirement to block both basal and stimulated gastric acid secretion effectively. Pirenzepine selectively blocks M1 muscarinic receptors, which does not meet the criteria as it does not affect H2 receptors. Omeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor that effectively blocks stimulated gastric acid secretion and does not affect the specified receptors, making it a strong candidate. Famotidine, like Loxatidine, blocks H2 receptors and reduces gastric acid secretion but does not meet the requirement of blocking both basal and stimulated secretion effectively. Therefore, the best option that aligns with the criteria of blocking both types of gastric acid secretion without affecting the specified receptors is Omeprazole.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"To determine the drug that blocks both basal and stimulated gastric acid secretion without affecting cholinergic, histaminergic, or gastrin receptors, we need to analyze the options provided. Loxatidine (opa) is an H2 receptor antagonist, which primarily targets H2 receptors and may not fully meet the requirement of blocking both types of secretion effectively. Pirenzepine (opb) selectively blocks M1 muscarinic receptors, which does not align with the requirement as it does not affect H2 receptors. Omeprazole (opc) is a proton pump inhibitor that effectively blocks both basal and stimulated gastric acid secretion and does not interact with the specified receptors, making it a strong candidate. Famotidine (opd), like Loxatidine, is an H2 receptor antagonist and does not meet the requirement of blocking both types of secretion effectively. Therefore, the best option that aligns with the criteria is Omeprazole, as it is known to inhibit the proton pump responsible for gastric acid secretion without affecting the specified receptors.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opc\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}",
