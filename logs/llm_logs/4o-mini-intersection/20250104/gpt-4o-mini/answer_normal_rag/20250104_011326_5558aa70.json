  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Based on the retrieved medical knowledge, Reserpine is known to treat depressive disorders, indicating it can cause depression as a side effect. Flupenthixol, an antipsychotic, is also associated with depressive symptoms. Oral contraceptives, particularly combined oral contraceptives, have been noted to potentially treat depressive symptoms in some cases. However, propranolol, a beta-blocker, is not commonly associated with depression as a side effect. Therefore, the most likely correct answer is that depression is not a side effect of propranolol.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opa\",\n    \"confidence\": 85\n}",
