  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Levamisole is primarily known for its use as an anthelmintic agent, particularly in treating ascariasis (option opa). It also has immunomodulatory properties, acting as an immunostimulant (option opb). The mechanism of action involves paralysis of worms through depolarization (option opc). However, the claim that it acts as an immunodepressant in high doses (option opd) is not supported by the primary literature, as Levamisole is generally recognized for its immunostimulatory effects rather than immunosuppression. Therefore, option opd is the correct answer as it does not align with the established uses of Levamisole.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opd\",\n    \"confidence\": 90\n}",
