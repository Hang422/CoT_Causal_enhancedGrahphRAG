  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Methylphenidate is widely recognized as the first-line treatment for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). The retrieved knowledge indicates that both imipramine and methylphenidate are mentioned in relation to treating ADHD, but methylphenidate is specifically noted as a standard treatment. Haloperidol and alprazolam are not typically used for ADHD, as haloperidol is an antipsychotic and alprazolam is a benzodiazepine, which are not indicated for this condition. Therefore, based on established pharmacological guidelines, methylphenidate is the most appropriate choice.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opd\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}",
