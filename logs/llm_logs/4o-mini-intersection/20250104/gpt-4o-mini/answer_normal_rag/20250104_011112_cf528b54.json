Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n                \n    ### Output Format\n    Provide your response in valid JSON format:\n    {   \n        \"final_analysis\": \"Your analysis of how the retrieved relationships support the answer\",\n        \"answer\": \"Option key from the available options (only key, like opa)\",\n        \"confidence\": Score between 0-100 based on evidence strength and relevance\n    }\n    "

  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"In Diabetes Insipidus (DI), the kidneys are unable to concentrate urine due to a deficiency of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) or a lack of response to it. This results in the production of large volumes of dilute urine. Typically, urine osmolality in DI is significantly lower than normal, often falling below 300 mmol/L. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is <300 mmol/L, as this reflects the characteristic low osmolality seen in DI.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opb\",\n    \"confidence\": 90\n}",
