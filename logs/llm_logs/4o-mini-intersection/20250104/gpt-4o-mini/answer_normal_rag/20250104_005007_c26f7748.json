  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Clonazepam is known to be effective in treating myoclonus, particularly in children. The retrieved knowledge indicates that clonazepam is specifically mentioned as a treatment for myoclonic conditions. While sodium valproate and phenobarbital are also used in various seizure disorders, they are not as specifically indicated for myoclonus as clonazepam. Ethosuximide is primarily used for absence seizures and is not typically indicated for myoclonus. Therefore, based on the evidence, clonazepam is the best-supported option for treating myoclonus in children.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opa\",\n    \"confidence\": 90\n}",
