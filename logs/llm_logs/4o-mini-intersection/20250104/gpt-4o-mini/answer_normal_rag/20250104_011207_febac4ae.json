  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Aromatase is the enzyme responsible for the conversion of androgens (such as testosterone) to estrogens (such as estradiol) in the ovarian follicles. This process is crucial for the regulation of the menstrual cycle and the development of female secondary sexual characteristics. The other options listed (5 alpha reductase, desmolase, and isomerase) do not play a direct role in this specific conversion. Therefore, based on established physiological knowledge, aromatase is the correct answer.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opa\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}",
