  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Cholesterol is transported from the liver to peripheral tissues primarily by Low-Density Lipoprotein (LDL). While High-Density Lipoprotein (HDL) is involved in reverse cholesterol transport, taking cholesterol from tissues back to the liver, LDL is the main carrier of cholesterol to peripheral tissues. Very Low-Density Lipoprotein (VLDL) primarily transports triglycerides, and chylomicrons are involved in transporting dietary lipids from the intestines. Therefore, the best-supported option is LDL.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opb\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}",
