  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"All three drugs listed are used in the management of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting. Aprepitant is a neurokinin-1 receptor antagonist that is effective in preventing acute and delayed nausea and vomiting. Dexamethasone is a corticosteroid that is often used in combination with other antiemetics to enhance their effectiveness. Ondansetron is a serotonin 5-HT3 receptor antagonist that is commonly used to prevent nausea and vomiting caused by chemotherapy. Therefore, since all three options are valid treatments for this condition, the best answer is 'All of the above'.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opd\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}",
