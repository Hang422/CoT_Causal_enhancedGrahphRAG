  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"The retrieved medical knowledge indicates that imiquimod is specifically mentioned as a treatment for genital condyloma, which is a type of genital wart. This aligns with the question asking for a topical immunomodulator for the treatment of genital warts. Other options like podophylline and interferon are also used for genital warts, but imiquimod is the most recognized topical immunomodulator for this condition. Acyclovir is primarily used for genital herpes, not warts. Therefore, imiquimod is the best-supported option.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opa\",\n    \"confidence\": 90\n}",
