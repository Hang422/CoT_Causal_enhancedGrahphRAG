  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Warfarin-induced skin necrosis is primarily associated with a deficiency in Protein C. This condition occurs when there is an initial pro-coagulation state due to the rapid decrease in Protein C levels after starting warfarin therapy, leading to thrombosis in the microvasculature of the skin. While Protein S deficiency can also contribute to thrombotic events, the classic association with warfarin-induced skin necrosis is specifically linked to Protein C deficiency. Therefore, the best-supported option is 'opa' for Protein C deficiency.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opa\",\n    \"confidence\": 90\n}",
