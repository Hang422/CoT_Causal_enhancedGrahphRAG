  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Hyoscine (also known as scopolamine) is well-documented as an effective medication for the prophylaxis of motion sickness. It works by blocking the action of acetylcholine in the vestibular system, which is involved in balance and spatial orientation. While metoclopramide and prochlorperazine are antiemetics that can be used to treat nausea, they are not primarily indicated for prophylaxis of motion sickness. Ondansetron is also an antiemetic but is more effective for nausea related to chemotherapy and postoperative settings rather than motion sickness. Therefore, the best-supported option for prophylaxis of motion sickness is hyoscine.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opa\",\n    \"confidence\": 90\n}",
