  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Nizatidine is indeed an H2 receptor antagonist used in the treatment of peptic ulcer disease, which supports option 'opa'. It is known to have high bioavailability, but not 100%, which makes option 'opb' potentially misleading. Nizatidine does not enhance gastric emptying, which is a function more associated with prokinetic agents rather than H2 blockers, supporting option 'opc' as incorrect. Lastly, while tachycardia can occur with some medications, it is not a common or well-documented side effect of Nizatidine, making option 'opd' also incorrect. Therefore, the best answer is 'opc' as it is the only statement that is definitively false regarding Nizatidine's pharmacological profile.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opc\",\n    \"confidence\": 85\n}",
