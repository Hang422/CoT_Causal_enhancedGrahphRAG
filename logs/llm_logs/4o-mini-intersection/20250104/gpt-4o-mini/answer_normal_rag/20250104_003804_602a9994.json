  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Propranolol is a non-selective beta-blocker that is effective in treating various conditions such as atrial flutter, thyrotoxicosis, and essential tremors. However, it is not typically used for hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM) as the primary treatment, where other medications or interventions are preferred. Therefore, the best-supported option for which propranolol is not useful is HOCM.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opd\",\n    \"confidence\": 85\n}",
