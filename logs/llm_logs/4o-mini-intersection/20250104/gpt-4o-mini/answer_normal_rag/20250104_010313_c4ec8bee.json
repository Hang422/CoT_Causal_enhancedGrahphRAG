  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Menke's Kinky Hair Syndrome is a genetic disorder caused by a defect in the copper transporter gene (ATP7A). This defect leads to impaired copper absorption and transport, resulting in copper deficiency, which is critical for the function of various enzymes. The other options (Ca, Zn, Se transporters) are not directly related to Menke's syndrome. Therefore, the most likely correct answer is 'Cu transporter'.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opb\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}",
