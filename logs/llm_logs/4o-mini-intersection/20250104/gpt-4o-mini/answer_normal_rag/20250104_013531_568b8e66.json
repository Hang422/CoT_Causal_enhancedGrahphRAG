  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Among the options provided, acetaminophen (option b) is known to have minimal gastric irritation compared to traditional NSAIDs like diclofenac, ibuprofen, and naproxen. While ibuprofen is often considered to have a lower risk of gastric irritation compared to other NSAIDs, acetaminophen is not classified as an NSAID and is generally well-tolerated in terms of gastric side effects. Therefore, acetaminophen is the least likely to cause gastric irritation.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opb\",\n    \"confidence\": 90\n}",
