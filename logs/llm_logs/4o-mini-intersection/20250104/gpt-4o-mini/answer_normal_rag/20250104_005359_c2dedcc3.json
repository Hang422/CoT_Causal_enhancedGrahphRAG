  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"The hormone primarily responsible for early detection of pregnancy is human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), which is secreted by the placenta shortly after implantation. This hormone is the basis for most pregnancy tests, as it can be detected in urine and blood. The other options listed (EGF, HCS, and Relaxin) do not play a role in early pregnancy detection. Therefore, the most accurate answer is option 'opb'.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opb\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}",
