Drug implicated is?\n\n    Options:\n    opa. Streptomycin\nopb. Isoniazid\nopc. Ethambutol\nopd. Rifampicin\n\n### Retrieved Similar Medical Knowledge:\n- Antibiotic therapy PREDISPOSES Tinnitus\n- Streptomycin ASSOCIATED_WITH Deafness\n- Tuberculosis, Multidrug-Resistant CAUSES Ototoxicity\n- Aminoglycosides COMPLICATES Deafness\n- Cervical spine LOCATION_OF Puncture biopsy\n- Structure of lamina vasculosa of choroid LOCATION_OF Medical Imaging\n- bevacizumab TREATS Hyperbilirubinemia\n- Optical filter ISA Filters\n\n    ### Instructions:\n            - Use standard medical knowledge as the primary guide.\n            - Consider enhanced information only if it aligns with consensus.\n            - If conflicting or unclear, present the most likely correct answer based on known facts.\n            - It's acceptable to show moderate confidence if the question is complex, but still choose one best answer.\n    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3.

  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Streptomycin is an aminoglycoside antibiotic that is known to cause ototoxicity, which can lead to symptoms such as deafness and tinnitus. The retrieved medical knowledge indicates that streptomycin is associated with deafness, making it the most likely drug implicated in this case. Other options like isoniazid, ethambutol, and rifampicin are not typically associated with these specific auditory side effects. Therefore, the evidence strongly supports that streptomycin is the drug responsible for the patient's symptoms.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opa\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}",
