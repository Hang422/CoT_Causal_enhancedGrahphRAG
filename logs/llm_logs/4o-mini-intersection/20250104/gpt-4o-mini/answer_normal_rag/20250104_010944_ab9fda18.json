  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"The development of a dry cough in a patient taking antihypertensive medication is most commonly associated with ACE inhibitors. This class of drugs can cause a persistent dry cough due to the accumulation of bradykinin, which is not broken down effectively when ACE is inhibited. Diuretics, calcium channel blockers, and beta blockers are not typically associated with causing a dry cough. Therefore, the most likely drug responsible for the condition is an ACE inhibitor.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opb\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}",
