  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Alpha-1 adrenergic blockers are commonly used to provide symptomatic relief in patients with Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH). Among the options provided, Tamsulosin is a selective alpha-1A adrenergic antagonist that is specifically indicated for the treatment of BPH. Prazosin and Oxazocin are also alpha-1 blockers but are less commonly used for BPH. Dolazoline is not typically used for this condition. Therefore, Tamsulosin is the most appropriate choice based on its specific indication and efficacy in treating BPH symptoms.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opa\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}",
