  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"The child's symptoms of aggressive behavior, self-mutilation, joint pain, and reduced urinary output suggest a metabolic disorder. The combination of neurological symptoms and joint pain is indicative of a deficiency in a purine metabolism enzyme. Adenosine Deaminase (ADA) deficiency is known to cause severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) and can lead to neurological issues and joint pain due to metabolic buildup. The other options do not align as closely with the presented symptoms. Therefore, the most likely enzyme deficiency in this case is Adenosine Deaminase.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opb\",\n    \"confidence\": 85\n}",
