  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Sertoli cells, which are found in the seminiferous tubules of the testes, are known to secrete androgen-binding protein (ABP). This protein binds to testosterone and other androgens, facilitating their action in the testes. The other options (testosterone, LH, and FSH) are not secreted by Sertoli cells; testosterone is produced by Leydig cells, while LH and FSH are produced by the anterior pituitary gland. Therefore, the most accurate answer is that Sertoli cells secrete androgen-binding protein.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opa\",\n    \"confidence\": 90\n}",
