He is put on isoniazid, rifampin, and ethambutol at home after initial treatment given at hospital. Which is accurate statement for this scenario?\n\n    Options:\n    opa. His 3-year-old sibling should receive INH prophylaxis\nopb. A baseline test of auditory function test is essential before drug treatment is initiated\nopc. Polyahralgia is a potential adverse effect of the drugs the boy is taking\nopd. His mother, who takes care of him, does not need INH prophylaxis\n\n### Retrieved Similar Medical Knowledge:\n- Maintenance therapy TREATS Adverse effects\n- Antituberculous drugs CAUSES Adverse effects\n- Treatment Protocols TREATS Tuberculosis\n- isoniazid CAUSES Adverse effects\n- Audiometry DIAGNOSES Tuberculosis\n- Boards TREATS Tuberculosis\n- Basis PREVENTS Osteoarthritis, Knee\n- Prophylactic treatment TREATS Tuberculosis\n\n    ### Instructions:\n            - Use standard medical knowledge as the primary guide.\n            - Consider enhanced information only if it aligns with consensus.\n            - If conflicting or unclear, present the most likely correct answer based on known facts.\n            - It's acceptable to show moderate confidence if the question is complex, but still choose one best answer.\n    ### Task:\n                1.

  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"In this scenario, the boy is being treated for uncomplicated pulmonary tuberculosis, and it is important to consider the risk of transmission to close contacts, especially young siblings. The recommendation for INH prophylaxis for the 3-year-old sibling is based on the fact that children under 5 years old who are exposed to someone with active tuberculosis are at higher risk of developing the disease themselves. Therefore, option 'opa' is accurate. The other options are less relevant: option 'opb' regarding auditory function tests is not a standard requirement for initiating treatment with these drugs, option 'opc' about polyarthralgia is not a common adverse effect of the drugs listed, and option 'opd' is incorrect as the mother may also need prophylaxis depending on her exposure risk. Thus, the best-supported option is 'opa'.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opa\",\n    \"confidence\": 90\n}",
