  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) is often due to a deficiency in the enzyme 21-hydroxylase, leading to an accumulation of steroid precursors and a deficiency in cortisol and aldosterone. In pregnant women, the use of dexamethasone is indicated to prevent the virilization of a female fetus at risk for CAH. Dexamethasone is a potent glucocorticoid that can cross the placenta and suppress the overproduction of adrenal androgens in the fetus. While hydrocortisone is used to treat CAH, it is not the drug of choice for prevention in a pregnant female. Therefore, the best-supported option is dexamethasone.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opa\",\n    \"confidence\": 90\n}",
