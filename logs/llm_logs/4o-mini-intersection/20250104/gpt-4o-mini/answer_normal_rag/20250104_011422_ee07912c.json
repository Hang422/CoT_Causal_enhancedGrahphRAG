  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Quinine is known to cause a range of side effects, one of which is cinchonism, a syndrome characterized by symptoms such as tinnitus, headache, nausea, and cardiovascular effects like palpitations. The sweating and palpitation experienced by the patient are consistent with cinchonism, which is a direct result of quinine administration. The other options, hyperglycemia, hypoglycemia, and hypokalemia, are less likely to be directly caused by quinine and do not typically present with the symptoms described in this scenario.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opa\",\n    \"confidence\": 90\n}",
