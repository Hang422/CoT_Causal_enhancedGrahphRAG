  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"The HMP shunt, also known as the pentose phosphate pathway, is crucial for generating NADPH and ribose-5-phosphate. It occurs in various tissues, including the liver, adipose tissue, and brain, as these tissues require NADPH for fatty acid synthesis and other biosynthetic processes. However, red blood cells (RBCs) primarily rely on glycolysis and do not utilize the HMP shunt for their metabolic needs. Therefore, the correct answer is that the HMP shunt does not occur in RBCs.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opc\",\n    \"confidence\": 90\n}",
