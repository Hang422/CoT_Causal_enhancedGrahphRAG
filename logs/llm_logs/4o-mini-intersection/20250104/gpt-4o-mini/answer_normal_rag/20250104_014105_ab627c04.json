  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Uricosuric drugs are medications that increase the excretion of uric acid in the urine, which is beneficial in treating conditions like gout. Among the options provided, Probenecid is well-known as a uricosuric agent, specifically used to lower uric acid levels in patients with gout. Allopurinol, while related to the treatment of gout, works by inhibiting uric acid production rather than increasing its excretion. Indomethacin is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) used for pain relief, and Aspirin, although it has some effects on uric acid levels, is not classified as a uricosuric agent. Therefore, the best-supported answer is Probenecid.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opb\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}",
