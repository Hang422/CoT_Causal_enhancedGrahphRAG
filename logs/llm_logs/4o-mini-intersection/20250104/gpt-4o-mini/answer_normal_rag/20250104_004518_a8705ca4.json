  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Cholecystokinin (CCK) is a hormone that plays a significant role in digestion. It is known to stimulate the contraction of the gallbladder, leading to the release of bile into the intestine. Additionally, CCK promotes the secretion of pancreatic juice that is rich in digestive enzymes, aiding in the digestion of fats and proteins. While CCK does influence the secretion of enterokinase, its primary actions are more directly related to gallbladder contraction and pancreatic enzyme secretion. Therefore, the most comprehensive answer that encompasses the primary actions of CCK is 'All', as it includes both gallbladder contraction and pancreatic enzyme secretion. The option regarding enterokinase secretion is less emphasized but still relevant. Thus, the best-supported option is 'All'.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opd\",\n    \"confidence\": 90\n}",
