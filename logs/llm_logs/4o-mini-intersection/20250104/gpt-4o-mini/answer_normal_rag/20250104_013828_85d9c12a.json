  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Epinephrine, when administered intravenously in high doses, primarily acts as a sympathomimetic agent, leading to increased heart rate, bronchodilation, and enhanced glycogenolysis in the liver. However, it does not cause bronchiolar constriction; rather, it causes bronchodilation. Therefore, option 'opb' is the correct answer as it describes an action that is contrary to the known effects of epinephrine.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opb\",\n    \"confidence\": 90\n}",
