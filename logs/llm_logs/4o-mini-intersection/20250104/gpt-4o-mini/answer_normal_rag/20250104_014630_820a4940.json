  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Loop diuretics, such as furosemide, are indeed referred to as 'high ceiling' diuretics because they can produce a significant diuretic effect. They act on the Na+.K+.2Cl- symporter in the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle. Loop diuretics can cause hyperuricemia due to increased uric acid reabsorption in the proximal tubule. However, they typically lead to hypocalcemia and hypomagnesemia rather than hypercalcemia. Therefore, the statement that loop diuretics lead to hypercalcemia and hypomagnesemia is incorrect.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opd\",\n    \"confidence\": 90\n}",
