  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"ADH (antidiuretic hormone), also known as vasopressin, is primarily secreted in response to increased plasma osmolarity and hypovolemia. Among the options provided, hypovolemia (option c) is known to stimulate the secretion of ADH as the body attempts to conserve water and restore blood volume. Hypervolemia (option a) and hypertension (option b) would typically lead to a decrease in ADH secretion, while a decrease in osmolarity (option d) would also inhibit ADH release. Therefore, hypovolemia is the most supported option for increased ADH secretion.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opc\",\n    \"confidence\": 90\n}",
