  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Dextromethorphan is known to cause hallucinations, especially at high doses, due to its action as an NMDA receptor antagonist. While morphine can also cause hallucinations, it is primarily an opioid used for pain relief and not typically classified as an antitussive in standard practice. Diphenhydramine, an antihistamine, can cause sedation and anticholinergic effects but is less commonly associated with hallucinations. Aprepitant is primarily used as an antiemetic and does not have a significant association with hallucinations. Therefore, the best-supported option is dextromethorphan.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opb\",\n    \"confidence\": 90\n}",
