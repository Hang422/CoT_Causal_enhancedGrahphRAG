  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Pseudotumor cerebri, also known as idiopathic intracranial hypertension, can be associated with certain medications. Among the options provided, tetracycline is known to cause increased intracranial pressure and has been linked to the development of pseudotumor cerebri. The other options (Sparfloxacin, Gentamicin, and Clofazimine) do not have a well-established association with this condition. Therefore, based on pharmacological knowledge, tetracycline is the most likely drug to cause pseudotumor cerebri.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opb\",\n    \"confidence\": 90\n}",
