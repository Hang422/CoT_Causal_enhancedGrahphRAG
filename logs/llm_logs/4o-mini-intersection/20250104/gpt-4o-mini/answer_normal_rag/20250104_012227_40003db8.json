  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"In patients undergoing cancer surgery, the risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) is significantly increased. Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) is the preferred anticoagulant for prophylaxis in this population due to its efficacy, safety profile, and ease of use compared to unfractionated heparin and warfarin. Heparin sulfate is not typically used for VTE prophylaxis, and protamine sulfate is actually an antidote for heparin, not an anticoagulant. Warfarin is not ideal for immediate prophylaxis in the perioperative setting due to its delayed onset of action. Therefore, the best-supported option is low molecular weight heparin.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opc\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}",
