  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"The stomach secretes hydrochloric acid (HCl), pepsinogens, and gastric lipase. HCl is crucial for creating an acidic environment for digestion, pepsinogens are precursors to pepsin, an enzyme that digests proteins, and gastric lipase aids in fat digestion. However, while lipase is secreted by the stomach, it is not the primary enzyme associated with gastric digestion compared to pepsin. Therefore, the question asks for what is not secreted by the stomach, and since all listed options are secreted by the stomach, the correct answer is 'None'.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opd\",\n    \"confidence\": 90\n}",
