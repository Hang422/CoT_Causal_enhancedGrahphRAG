  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Diuretics are commonly used in the management of heart failure to help reduce fluid overload. However, certain diuretics may have contraindications based on the specific clinical scenario. Mannitol is an osmotic diuretic that is typically used for conditions like cerebral edema and is not indicated for heart failure. Spironolactone is a potassium-sparing diuretic that is often used in heart failure management. Furosemide is a loop diuretic that is also frequently used in heart failure. Hydrochlorothiazide is a thiazide diuretic that can be used in some cases of heart failure but is less effective than loop diuretics. Given that mannitol is not indicated for heart failure and can potentially worsen the condition due to its effects on fluid balance, it is the most appropriate answer to the question regarding contraindication in the presence of cardiac failure.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opa\",\n    \"confidence\": 90\n}",
