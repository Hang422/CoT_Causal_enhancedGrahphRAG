  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"The lungs play a significant role in the metabolism of various substances, particularly in the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II, which is a critical step in the renin-angiotensin system that regulates blood pressure and fluid balance. While the lungs also inactivate serotonin and bradykinin, the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II is the most well-documented and recognized metabolic function of the lungs. Therefore, option 'opb' is the best-supported answer based on established physiological knowledge.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opb\",\n    \"confidence\": 90\n}",
