  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"The retrieved medical knowledge indicates that Trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole (Cotrimoxazole) is specifically mentioned as a treatment for pneumonia caused by Pneumocystis carinii. This aligns with established clinical guidelines, which recommend Cotrimoxazole as the first-line treatment for Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP). Other options listed, such as Penicillin, Kanamycin, and Levofloxacin, are not typically used for this specific type of pneumonia. Therefore, the best-supported option is Cotrimoxazole.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opb\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}",
