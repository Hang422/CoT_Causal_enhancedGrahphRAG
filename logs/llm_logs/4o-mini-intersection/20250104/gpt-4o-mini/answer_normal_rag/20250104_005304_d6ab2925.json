  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"In the context of treating hyperthyroidism during the first trimester of pregnancy, Propylthiouracil (PTU) is generally preferred over Methimazole due to its lower risk of teratogenic effects in early pregnancy. Methimazole is associated with potential risks such as maternal hypothyroidism and congenital malformations if used in the first trimester. Carbimazole is a prodrug of Methimazole and carries similar risks. Perchlorate is not commonly used due to safety concerns. Therefore, the best-supported option for treating hyperthyroidism in the first trimester is Propylthiouracil.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opb\",\n    \"confidence\": 90\n}",
