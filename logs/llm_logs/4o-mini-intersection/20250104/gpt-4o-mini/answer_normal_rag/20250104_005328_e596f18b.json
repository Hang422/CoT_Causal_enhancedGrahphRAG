  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Secretin is a hormone produced by the S cells in the duodenum in response to acidic chyme entering from the stomach. Its primary role is to stimulate the pancreas to secrete bicarbonate, which helps to neutralize gastric acid in the small intestine. While secretin does have other actions, such as decreasing gastric secretion and influencing the pyloric sphincter, its most significant and well-documented action is the increase in bicarbonate secretion by the pancreas. Therefore, the best-supported option is that secretin increases the secretion of bicarbonates by the pancreas.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opb\",\n    \"confidence\": 90\n}",
