  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Neurogenic diabetes insipidus is primarily caused by a deficiency of vasopressin (antidiuretic hormone). Desmopressin is a synthetic analog of vasopressin that is specifically used to treat central diabetes insipidus, which is the form of diabetes insipidus caused by a lack of vasopressin production. The retrieved knowledge indicates that desmopressin is effective for treating central diabetes insipidus, which aligns with the condition described in the question. Therefore, desmopressin is the drug of choice for neurogenic diabetes insipidus.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opc\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}",
