  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Phenytoin is known to follow zero-order kinetics at therapeutic levels, meaning that its elimination rate is constant regardless of concentration. It is also a hepatic enzyme inducer, which contradicts option 'opb'. Phenytoin is not excreted unchanged in urine; rather, it is metabolized in the liver before excretion, which rules out option 'opc'. Additionally, phenytoin is teratogenic and can cause fetal hydantoin syndrome, making option 'opd' incorrect. Therefore, the only true statement is that phenytoin follows zero-order kinetics.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opa\",\n    \"confidence\": 90\n}",
