  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"The renal system is known to produce several important peptides, including renin and erythropoietin. Renin is produced by the juxtaglomerular cells of the kidneys and is crucial for the regulation of blood pressure through the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Erythropoietin is produced by the kidneys in response to low oxygen levels and stimulates red blood cell production. Angiotensin I is a precursor peptide that is formed from angiotensinogen, which is produced in the liver, but its conversion to angiotensin II occurs in the lungs and is influenced by renin from the kidneys. However, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25DHCC) is primarily produced in the kidneys but is not a peptide; it is a steroid hormone derived from vitamin D. Therefore, the peptide that is not produced by the renal system is 1,25DHCC, as it is not classified as a peptide but rather as a hormone.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opd\",\n    \"confidence\": 85\n}",
