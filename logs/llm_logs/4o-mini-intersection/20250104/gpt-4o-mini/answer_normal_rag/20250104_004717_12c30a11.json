  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Glycogen storage diseases are a group of inherited metabolic disorders that result from the body's inability to properly store and utilize glycogen due to enzyme deficiencies. The options provided include Krabbe's disease and Fabry's disease, which are not classified as glycogen storage diseases. Krabbe's disease is a lysosomal storage disorder caused by a deficiency of the enzyme galactocerebrosidase, while Fabry's disease is also a lysosomal storage disorder caused by a deficiency of the enzyme alpha-galactosidase A. Fragile syndrome, or Fragile X syndrome, is a genetic condition caused by a mutation in the FMR1 gene and is not related to glycogen storage. Therefore, all the options listed (Krabbe's disease, Fabry's disease, and Fragile syndrome) are not glycogen storage diseases, making the correct answer 'All'.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opd\",\n    \"confidence\": 90\n}",
