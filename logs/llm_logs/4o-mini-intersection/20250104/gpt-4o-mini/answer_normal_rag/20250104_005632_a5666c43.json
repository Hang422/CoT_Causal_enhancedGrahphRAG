  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Aldosterone primarily acts on the distal tubules and collecting ducts of the nephron. It promotes sodium reabsorption and potassium excretion, which are critical for regulating blood pressure and fluid balance. While it has some effects on the proximal tubule, its most significant actions are in the distal tubules and collecting duct. Therefore, the best-supported option is 'opd. Collecting duct', as it is one of the primary sites of aldosterone action.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opd\",\n    \"confidence\": 90\n}",
