  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"The fluidity of the plasma membrane is influenced by the types of lipids present. Cholesterol is known to play a crucial role in maintaining membrane fluidity; it helps to prevent the fatty acid chains of phospholipids from packing too closely together, thus increasing fluidity. Arachidonic acid, while a polyunsaturated fatty acid, can also contribute to fluidity but is not as significant as cholesterol in this context. Palmitic acid and stearic acid are saturated fatty acids, which tend to make membranes more rigid and decrease fluidity. Therefore, the best-supported option for increasing plasma membrane fluidity is cholesterol.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opb\",\n    \"confidence\": 90\n}",
