  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"In patients with severe renal failure, the use of certain antitubercular drugs must be carefully considered due to their renal clearance and potential toxicity. Ethambutol is primarily excreted by the kidneys, and its dosage needs to be adjusted in renal impairment. Streptomycin and Capreomycin are aminoglycosides, which are also contraindicated in severe renal failure due to the risk of nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity. Rifampicin, while it is not primarily renally excreted, can still be used with caution in renal failure but may require dose adjustments. However, Ethambutol is the most commonly used antitubercular drug that can be adjusted for use in patients with renal failure, making it the safest option among those listed.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opb\",\n    \"confidence\": 85\n}",
