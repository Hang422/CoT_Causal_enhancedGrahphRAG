  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Chlorpropamide is a sulfonylurea that is primarily used to treat diabetes mellitus. However, it also has an antidiuretic effect, which makes it useful in treating diabetes insipidus, particularly the nephrogenic type. The other options (Glibenclamide, Glicazide, and Glipizide) are also sulfonylureas used for diabetes mellitus but do not have the same effect on diabetes insipidus. Therefore, Chlorpropamide is the most appropriate choice for treating both conditions.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opa\",\n    \"confidence\": 85\n}",
