  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Iron absorption primarily occurs in the duodenum, which is the first part of the small intestine. While some iron absorption can occur in the stomach, the majority takes place in the duodenum and to a lesser extent in the jejunum. The ileum is less involved in iron absorption. Therefore, the best-supported option is 'Duodenum + Jejunum', as it encompasses the primary site of absorption (duodenum) and acknowledges some absorption in the jejunum, making it the most comprehensive choice.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opd\",\n    \"confidence\": 85\n}",
