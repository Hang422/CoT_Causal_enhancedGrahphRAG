  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"In herpes simplex encephalitis, the primary antiviral treatment is Acyclovir, which is effective against the herpes simplex virus. Vidarabine is also an antiviral that has been used historically for herpes infections, though it is less common now. Ganciclovir is primarily used for cytomegalovirus infections and is not typically indicated for herpes simplex encephalitis. Amantadine is an antiviral that is used primarily for influenza and Parkinson's disease, and it is not effective against herpes simplex virus. Therefore, the drug that is least relevant to the treatment of herpes simplex encephalitis is Amantadine.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opd\",\n    \"confidence\": 90\n}",
