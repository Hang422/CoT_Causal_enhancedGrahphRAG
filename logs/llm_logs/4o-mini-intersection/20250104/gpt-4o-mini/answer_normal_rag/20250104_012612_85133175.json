  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Hyperprolactinemia is commonly associated with certain medications, particularly those that block dopamine receptors. Among the options provided, Metoclopramide is known to cause hyperprolactinemia due to its dopamine antagonist properties. Bromocriptine, on the other hand, is used to treat hyperprolactinemia by acting as a dopamine agonist. Levodopa and Amantadine are primarily used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease and are not typically associated with causing hyperprolactinemia. Therefore, the best-supported option is Metoclopramide.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opd\",\n    \"confidence\": 90\n}",
