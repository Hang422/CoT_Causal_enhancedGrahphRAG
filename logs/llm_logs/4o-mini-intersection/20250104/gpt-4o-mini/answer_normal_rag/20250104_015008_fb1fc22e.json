  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Peptic ulcer disease caused by chronic use of NSAIDs is typically treated with medications that can protect the gastric mucosa and reduce acid secretion. Misoprostol (option c) is a prostaglandin analog that helps to protect the stomach lining and is specifically indicated for preventing NSAID-induced ulcers. Esomeprazole (option d) is a proton pump inhibitor that reduces gastric acid secretion and is also effective in treating peptic ulcers, but it is not specifically the first-line treatment for NSAID-induced ulcers. Therefore, Misoprostol is the drug of choice in this scenario due to its protective effects against NSAID-induced mucosal injury.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opc\",\n    \"confidence\": 90\n}",
