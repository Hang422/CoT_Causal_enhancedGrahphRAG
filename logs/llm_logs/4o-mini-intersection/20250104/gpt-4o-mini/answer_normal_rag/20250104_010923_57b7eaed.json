  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Lithium is commonly used in the treatment of manic-depressive psychosis (bipolar disorder) and is effective for acute manic episodes. Monitoring serum lithium levels is crucial for dose adjustment due to its narrow therapeutic index. Long-term use of lithium can lead to hypothyroidism, not hyperthyroidism. Leucocytosis can occur but is not a common or direct effect of lithium therapy. Therefore, the most accurate statement regarding lithium use in this context is that it can result in hypothyroidism on long-term use, which aligns with established medical knowledge.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opd\",\n    \"confidence\": 85\n}",
