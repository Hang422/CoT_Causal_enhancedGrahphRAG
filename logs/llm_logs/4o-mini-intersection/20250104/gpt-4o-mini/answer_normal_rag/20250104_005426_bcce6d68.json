  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Nimodipine is a calcium channel blocker specifically indicated for the prevention of cerebral vasospasm following subarachnoid hemorrhage. The retrieved knowledge indicates that calcium channel blockers are used in the treatment of subarachnoid hemorrhage, and nimodipine is the most commonly used agent in this context. While diltiazem is also mentioned in relation to subarachnoid hemorrhage, nimodipine is the standard treatment and is more specifically indicated for this condition. Therefore, based on the consensus and the specific indication for subarachnoid hemorrhage, nimodipine is the best-supported option.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opa\",\n    \"confidence\": 90\n}",
