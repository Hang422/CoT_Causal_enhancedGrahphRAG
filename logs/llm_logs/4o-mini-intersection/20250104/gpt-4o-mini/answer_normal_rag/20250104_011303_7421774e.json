  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Propranolol is a non-selective beta-blocker that can exacerbate certain conditions. In patients with diabetes, it can mask the symptoms of hypoglycemia, which is a significant concern. While propranolol can be used in patients with glaucoma, essential tremor, and supraventricular tachycardia, the risk of masking hypoglycemia symptoms makes diabetes the most concerning comorbidity when using propranolol. Therefore, the best-supported option is diabetes.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opc\",\n    \"confidence\": 85\n}",
