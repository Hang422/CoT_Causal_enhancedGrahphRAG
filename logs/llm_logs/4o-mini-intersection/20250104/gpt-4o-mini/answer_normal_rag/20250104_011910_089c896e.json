He has a history of being treated for duodenal ulcer 4 years back. Investigation reveals elevation of gastrin levels. Which of the following statement is true regarding gastrin?\n\n    Options:\n    opa. Secreted by parietal cells of stomach\nopb. Secreted by alpha ceils of pancreas\nopc. Decreases bicarbonate content in pancreatic secretion\nopd. It gets stimulated by endoluminal peptides in stomach\n\n### Retrieved Similar Medical Knowledge:\n- Trichophyton rubrum CAUSES Tinea profunda (disorder)\n- Bilirubin measurement DIAGNOSES Acute cholangitis\n- Inferior Colliculus LOCATION_OF hyperfunction\n- Cells INTERACTS_WITH RBPJ gene|RBPJ\n- STAT3 gene|STAT3 ASSOCIATED_WITH Fibromyalgia\n- Pancreatic duct LOCATION_OF Soft tissue lesion\n- Scanning DIAGNOSES Mild hydronephrosis\n- Gastrin TREATS Ulcer\n- Ulcer ASSOCIATED_WITH Gastrin\n\n    ### Instructions:\n            - Use standard medical knowledge as the primary guide.\n            - Consider enhanced information only if it aligns with consensus.\n            - If conflicting or unclear, present the most likely correct answer based on known facts.\n            - It's acceptable to show moderate confidence if the question is complex, but still choose one best answer.\n    ### Task:\n                1.

  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Gastrin is a hormone primarily secreted by G cells in the gastric mucosa, not by parietal cells (which secrete hydrochloric acid). It stimulates gastric acid secretion and is involved in the digestive process. The statement regarding gastrin being stimulated by endoluminal peptides in the stomach is accurate, as gastrin release can be triggered by the presence of peptides and amino acids in the stomach. Therefore, the correct answer is that gastrin gets stimulated by endoluminal peptides in the stomach.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opd\",\n    \"confidence\": 90\n}",
