  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Chloroquine is known to cause retinal toxicity, specifically chloroquine retinopathy, which can lead to retinal pigmentation changes. The retrieved knowledge indicates that antimalarials, particularly chloroquine, are associated with pigmentation disorders. While quinine, mefloquine, and atovaquone are also antimalarials, chloroquine is the most well-documented in relation to retinal pigmentation effects. Therefore, based on the evidence, chloroquine is the most likely answer.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opb\",\n    \"confidence\": 90\n}",
