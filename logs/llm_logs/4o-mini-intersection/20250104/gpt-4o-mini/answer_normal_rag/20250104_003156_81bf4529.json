  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"The patient's symptoms of diminished vision during night, dryness of eyes, and recurrent bacterial infections, along with the presence of white triangular plaques on the conjunctiva, suggest a deficiency in Vitamin A. Vitamin A is crucial for maintaining healthy vision, particularly in low-light conditions, and its deficiency can lead to night blindness and dryness of the eyes (xerophthalmia). The presence of conjunctival plaques (Bitot's spots) is also characteristic of Vitamin A deficiency. Other vitamin deficiencies listed do not align as closely with the symptoms presented.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opc\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}",
