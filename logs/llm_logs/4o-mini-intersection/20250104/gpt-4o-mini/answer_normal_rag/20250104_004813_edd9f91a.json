  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Tamoxifen is a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) that is primarily used in the treatment of breast cancer. It has been associated with endometrial hyperplasia due to its estrogenic effects on the endometrium. While it can have various effects on lipid profiles, the evidence suggests that it does not cause osteoporosis directly, and it is not linked to ovarian cancer. Therefore, the most supported option based on the retrieved knowledge is that Tamoxifen causes endometrial hyperplasia.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opb\",\n    \"confidence\": 90\n}",
