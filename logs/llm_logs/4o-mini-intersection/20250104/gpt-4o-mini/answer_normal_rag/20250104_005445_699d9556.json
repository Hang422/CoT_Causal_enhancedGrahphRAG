  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Magaldrate is an antacid that contains both magnesium and aluminum compounds. When it comes into contact with gastric acid, it dissociates to form magnesium hydroxide and aluminum hydroxide. This is consistent with the pharmacological properties of magaldrate, which is used to neutralize stomach acid. Therefore, the most accurate answer is that magaldrate is converted to magnesium hydroxide and aluminum hydroxide upon exposure to gastric acid.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opc\",\n    \"confidence\": 90\n}",
