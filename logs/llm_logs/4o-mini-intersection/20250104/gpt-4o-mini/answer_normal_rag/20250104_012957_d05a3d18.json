  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Testosterone production is primarily associated with Leydig cells, which are located in the interstitial tissue of the testes. These cells are responsible for synthesizing and secreting testosterone in response to luteinizing hormone (LH) stimulation. The other options, such as Sertoli cells and seminiferous tubules, are involved in spermatogenesis and support of germ cells but do not produce testosterone. The epididymis is involved in sperm maturation and storage but does not contribute to testosterone production. Therefore, the most accurate answer is Leydig cells.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opa\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}",
