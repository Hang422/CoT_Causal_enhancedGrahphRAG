  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Fosphenytoin is a prodrug of phenytoin and is primarily used for the treatment of seizures, similar to phenytoin. However, it differs in its solubility and administration. Fosphenytoin can be mixed with saline, making it more versatile for intravenous administration compared to phenytoin, which cannot be mixed with saline due to its insolubility. The other options are incorrect as fosphenytoin is not indicated for absence seizures, is not typically given orally (it is usually administered intravenously), and is not the drug of choice for myoclonic seizures. Therefore, the correct answer is that fosphenytoin can be mixed with saline.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opb\",\n    \"confidence\": 90\n}",
