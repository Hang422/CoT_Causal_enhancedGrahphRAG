  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Naltrexone, Acamprosate, and Disulfiram are all established pharmacological treatments for alcohol dependence. Naltrexone works by reducing cravings, Acamprosate helps maintain abstinence, and Disulfiram causes unpleasant reactions when alcohol is consumed, thus deterring drinking. Flumazenil, however, is primarily used as an antidote for benzodiazepine overdose and is not indicated for the treatment of alcohol dependence. Therefore, it is the correct answer as it does not belong to the category of medications used to treat alcohol dependence.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opc\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}",
