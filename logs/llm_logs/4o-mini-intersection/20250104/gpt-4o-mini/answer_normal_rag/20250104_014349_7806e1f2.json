  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Progesterone is primarily produced by the corpus luteum in the ovary after ovulation. The corpus luteum forms from the remnants of the mature follicle and is responsible for secreting progesterone, which is crucial for maintaining the uterine lining for potential implantation of an embryo. The stroma and corpora albicans do not produce significant amounts of progesterone, and mature follicles primarily produce estrogen. Therefore, the best-supported option is the corpus luteum.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opc\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}",
