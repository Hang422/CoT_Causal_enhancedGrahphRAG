  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Isoniazid is known to interfere with the metabolism of vitamin B6 (pyridoxine), leading to a deficiency. This is due to isoniazid's ability to form a complex with pyridoxal phosphate, the active form of vitamin B6, which is essential for various enzymatic reactions in the body. While other vitamin deficiencies can occur, the most well-documented and clinically significant deficiency associated with isoniazid use is that of vitamin B6. Therefore, the most likely correct answer is vitamin B6.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opc\",\n    \"confidence\": 90\n}",
