  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Heparin is a well-known anticoagulant that works primarily by activating antithrombin, which inhibits thrombin and factor Xa, thus preventing clot formation. The statement about heparin being the 'weakest acid found in living things' is not accurate; heparin is a glycosaminoglycan and does not fit this description. The other statements regarding heparin's source (from pig intestinal mucosa), its mechanism of action (via antithrombin activation), and its potential to cause thrombocytopenia (a decrease in platelet count) are all true. Therefore, the incorrect statement is the one regarding heparin being the weakest acid.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opa\",\n    \"confidence\": 90\n}",
