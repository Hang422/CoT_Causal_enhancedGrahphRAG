  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Gp2b3A inhibitors are a class of antiplatelet drugs that inhibit the glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor on platelets, preventing platelet aggregation. The options provided include abciximab, eptifibatide, and tirofiban, all of which are known Gp2b3A inhibitors. Prasugrel, however, is a thienopyridine that works by inhibiting the ADP receptor on platelets (P2Y12), and is not classified as a Gp2b3A inhibitor. Therefore, the correct answer is Prasugrel, as it does not belong to the same class as the other three options.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opd\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}",
