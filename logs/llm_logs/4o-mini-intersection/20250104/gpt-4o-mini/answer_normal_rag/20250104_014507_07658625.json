  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"In the case of a needle stick injury involving a high-risk source (an AIDS patient with a very low CD4 count and high viral load), post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) is recommended. The standard PEP regimen includes a combination of antiretroviral medications, typically zidovudine (AZT) and lamivudine (3TC), for a duration of 4 weeks. This approach is supported by guidelines from health authorities such as the CDC. The option to monitor the nurse's blood alone is insufficient as immediate treatment is necessary to reduce the risk of HIV transmission. Therefore, the best-supported option is to administer zidovudine with lamivudine for 4 weeks.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opd\",\n    \"confidence\": 90\n}",
