  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Adrenal insufficiency is characterized by a deficiency in cortisol and often aldosterone. This condition typically leads to hyponatremia due to decreased aldosterone levels, which normally help retain sodium. Hyperkalemia can occur due to the lack of aldosterone, which promotes potassium excretion. Hypoglycemia is also associated with adrenal insufficiency due to low cortisol levels, which are necessary for gluconeogenesis. However, metabolic alkalosis is not typically associated with adrenal insufficiency; rather, it is often linked to conditions that cause hypokalemia, such as excessive aldosterone. Therefore, metabolic alkalosis is the least likely to be associated with adrenal insufficiency.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opd\",\n    \"confidence\": 90\n}",
