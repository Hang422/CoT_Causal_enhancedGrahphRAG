  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"The zona reticularis of the adrenal cortex is primarily responsible for the secretion of androgens, which are steroid hormones that include dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and androstenedione. The other options listed (glucocorticoids, mineralocorticoids, and aldosterone) are primarily secreted by other zones of the adrenal cortex: glucocorticoids by the zona fasciculata and mineralocorticoids (including aldosterone) by the zona glomerulosa. Therefore, the most accurate answer is that the major hormone secreted by the zona reticularis is androgens.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opd\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}",
