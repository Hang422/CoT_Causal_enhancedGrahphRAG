  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Pulmonary fibrosis is a known complication associated with certain chemotherapeutic agents. Among the options provided, Methotrexate (opa) is well-documented to cause pulmonary toxicity, including pulmonary fibrosis, particularly in patients receiving high doses or prolonged therapy. Doxorubicin (opb), Cisplatin (opc), and Busulfan (opd) are also associated with various pulmonary complications, but Methotrexate has a more established link to pulmonary fibrosis specifically. Therefore, based on the consensus in pharmacology and clinical practice, Methotrexate is the most likely correct answer.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opa\",\n    \"confidence\": 85\n}",
