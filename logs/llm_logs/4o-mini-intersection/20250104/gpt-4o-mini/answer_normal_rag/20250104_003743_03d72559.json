  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Digoxin is known to interact with several drugs, including cholestyramine, thiazide diuretics, and quinidine. Cholestyramine can bind to digoxin in the gastrointestinal tract, reducing its absorption. Thiazide diuretics can lead to electrolyte imbalances, particularly hypokalemia, which can increase the risk of digoxin toxicity. Quinidine can increase digoxin levels by inhibiting its renal clearance. Amlodipine, a calcium channel blocker, does not have significant interactions with digoxin, making it the exception among the listed options.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opd\",\n    \"confidence\": 90\n}",
