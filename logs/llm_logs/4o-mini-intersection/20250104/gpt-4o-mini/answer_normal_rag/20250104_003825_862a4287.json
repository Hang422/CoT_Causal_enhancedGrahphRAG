While there is some evidence suggesting that antidepressants and anticonvulsants may have adjunctive roles in treatment, the first-line treatment remains antipsychotics. Therefore, based on the consensus in pharmacological treatment for schizophrenia, the most appropriate answer is 'Anti psychotics'.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opb\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}",
