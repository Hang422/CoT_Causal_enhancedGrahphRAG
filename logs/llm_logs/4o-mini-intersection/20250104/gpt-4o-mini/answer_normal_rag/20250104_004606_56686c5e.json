  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Valproic acid is known to have several side effects, including causing obesity, hirsutism, and neural tube defects. However, it is not classified as an enzyme inducer; rather, it is an enzyme inhibitor, particularly of the cytochrome P450 system. Therefore, the statement that it is an enzyme inducer is incorrect. The other options are well-documented side effects of valproic acid, making 'It is an enzyme inducer' the only false statement.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opa\",\n    \"confidence\": 90\n}",
