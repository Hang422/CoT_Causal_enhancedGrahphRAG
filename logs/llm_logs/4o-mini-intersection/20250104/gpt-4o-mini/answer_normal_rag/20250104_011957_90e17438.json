  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Aspirin is known to irritate the gastrointestinal tract and can exacerbate or cause peptic ulcers. The retrieved knowledge indicates that aspirin predisposes to ulcer formation, which supports the conclusion that it is contraindicated in patients with peptic ulcers. While aspirin is used in the management of unstable angina, it is not contraindicated in that condition. Fever and myalgia are not contraindications for aspirin use. Therefore, the best-supported option is peptic ulcer.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opb\",\n    \"confidence\": 90\n}",
