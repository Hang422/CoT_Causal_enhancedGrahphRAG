  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Rifampicin is known to induce the metabolism of many drugs by inducing cytochrome P450 enzymes, which can significantly reduce the effectiveness of antiretroviral drugs such as zidovudine and lamivudine. This interaction can lead to subtherapeutic levels of these antiretrovirals, potentially resulting in treatment failure for HIV. Therefore, in a patient who is HIV positive and on a regimen that includes zidovudine, lamivudine, and indinavir, rifampicin should be avoided. The other options (pyrazinamide, isoniazid, and ethambutol) do not have the same level of interaction with these antiretrovirals and are generally considered safer in this context.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opd\",\n    \"confidence\": 90\n}",
