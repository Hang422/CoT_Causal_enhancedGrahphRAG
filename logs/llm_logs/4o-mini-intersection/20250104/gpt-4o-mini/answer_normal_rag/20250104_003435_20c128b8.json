  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Fluconazole is an antifungal medication primarily effective against Candida species and some other fungi, but it is not effective against Aspergillus species, which are typically treated with other antifungals like voriconazole or amphotericin B. Fluconazole does penetrate the blood-brain barrier, making it effective for treating fungal infections of the central nervous system. Its oral bioavailability is actually higher than that of ketoconazole, which is known for its lower absorption. Fluconazole inhibits the enzyme lanosterol 14-alpha-demethylase, which is involved in the synthesis of ergosterol, a key component of fungal cell membranes. Therefore, the most accurate statement is that it inhibits demethylation of lanosterol.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opd\",\n    \"confidence\": 90\n}",
