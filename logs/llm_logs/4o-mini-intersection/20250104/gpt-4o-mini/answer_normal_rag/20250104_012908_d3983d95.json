  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Chylomicrons are lipoprotein particles that transport dietary lipids from the intestines to other locations in the body, including the liver. They are formed in the intestinal mucosa and are the primary vehicle for lipid transport after a meal. VLDL, HDL, and LDL are involved in lipid transport but primarily deal with endogenous lipids and cholesterol rather than dietary lipids from the intestine. Therefore, the most accurate answer is that lipids are transferred from the intestine to the liver by chylomicrons.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opa\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}",
