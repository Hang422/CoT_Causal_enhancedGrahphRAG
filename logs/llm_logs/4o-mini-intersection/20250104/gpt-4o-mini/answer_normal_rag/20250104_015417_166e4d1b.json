  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Chloroquine is primarily known for its use in treating malaria and certain autoimmune diseases, particularly lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis. The retrieved knowledge indicates that chloroquine is effective in treating virus diseases and communicable diseases, which aligns with its use in autoimmune conditions. However, it is not indicated for infectious mononucleosis, which is typically treated with supportive care. Therefore, the best-supported option is that chloroquine is useful in discoid lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis, but not in infectious mononucleosis. Thus, the correct answer is 'opa' for discoid lupus erythematosus.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opa\",\n    \"confidence\": 85\n}",
