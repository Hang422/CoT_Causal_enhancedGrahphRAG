  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Salbutamol is a well-known beta-2 adrenergic agonist that is commonly used as a bronchodilator in the treatment of bronchial asthma. It is typically administered via aerosol inhalers, making it the most appropriate choice among the options provided. Ketotifen is an antihistamine, Fluticasone is a corticosteroid, and Montelukast is a leukotriene receptor antagonist, none of which are beta adrenergic agonists or used primarily as aerosols for asthma treatment.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opa\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}",
