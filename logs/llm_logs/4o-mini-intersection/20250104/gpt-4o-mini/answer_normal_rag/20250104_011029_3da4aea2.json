  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Ethambutol is known to cause retrobulbar neuritis, which is characterized by visual disturbances and is a well-documented side effect of the drug. The other options, such as deafness, red urine, and peripheral neuritis, are not commonly associated with ethambutol. Therefore, the most supported answer based on pharmacological knowledge is that ethambutol causes retrobulbar neuritis.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opa\",\n    \"confidence\": 90\n}",
