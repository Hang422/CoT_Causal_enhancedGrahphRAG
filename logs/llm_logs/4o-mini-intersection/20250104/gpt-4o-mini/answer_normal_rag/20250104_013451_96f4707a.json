  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Tamoxifen is known to have several adverse effects, including an increased risk of thromboembolism, endometrial carcinoma, and the potential for carcinoma in the contralateral breast. However, while cataracts can occur, they are not a well-established or common adverse effect directly associated with tamoxifen use. The other options are more directly linked to the pharmacological effects and risks of tamoxifen. Therefore, the best-supported answer is that cataracts are not a typical adverse effect of tamoxifen.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opd\",\n    \"confidence\": 85\n}",
