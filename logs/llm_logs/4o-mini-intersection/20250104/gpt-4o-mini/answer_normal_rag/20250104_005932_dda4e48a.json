  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Insulin is a peptide hormone produced by the beta cells of the pancreas, not the alpha cells (which produce glucagon). Insulin consists of two polypeptide chains (A and B) that are linked by disulfide bonds, making option opb correct. Insulin does not shift potassium outside the cell; rather, it facilitates the uptake of potassium into cells. The half-life of subcutaneous insulin is generally around 30 minutes to 2 hours, depending on the formulation, making option opd less accurate. Therefore, the most accurate statement regarding insulin is that it consists of two polypeptide chains bound by disulfide linkages.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opb\",\n    \"confidence\": 90\n}",
