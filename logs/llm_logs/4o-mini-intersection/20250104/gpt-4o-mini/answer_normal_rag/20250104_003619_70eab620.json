  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Fibrinolytic drugs, used in the treatment of acute myocardial infarction, primarily work by dissolving blood clots. One of the most significant adverse effects associated with these agents is the risk of bleeding, particularly intracranial hemorrhage, which can lead to a hemorrhagic stroke. The other options listed, such as acute renal failure, development of antiplatelet antibodies, and encephalitis secondary to liver dysfunction, are not commonly associated with fibrinolytic therapy. Therefore, the most likely adverse effect from the use of fibrinolytics in this context is a hemorrhagic stroke.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opd\",\n    \"confidence\": 90\n}",
