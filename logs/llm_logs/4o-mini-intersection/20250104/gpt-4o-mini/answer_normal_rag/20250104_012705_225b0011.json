  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Triamterene is a potassium-sparing diuretic that primarily works by inhibiting sodium reabsorption in the distal nephron, which leads to potassium retention. Therefore, it is known to cause hyperkalemia rather than hypokalemia. The other options do not align with the pharmacological effects of triamterene. Better glucose tolerance is not a known effect, muscle cramps can occur with electrolyte imbalances but are not directly caused by triamterene, and a decrease in urea level is not a primary effect of this medication. Thus, the most relevant option is that it does not cause hypokalemia, which is the opposite of its known effect.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opd\",\n    \"confidence\": 90\n}",
