  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Vitamin B12 absorption is primarily dependent on intrinsic factor, which is secreted by the stomach. The absorption of the vitamin B12-intrinsic factor complex occurs specifically in the ileum, as indicated by the retrieved knowledge that states 'ileum LOCATION_OF Intrinsic factor'. This aligns with established medical understanding that the ileum is the site where vitamin B12 is absorbed after it has been bound to intrinsic factor. The other options (duodenum, jejunum, colon) are not the primary sites for vitamin B12 absorption, making the ileum the most appropriate choice.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opb\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}",
