Which of the following enzymes is defective?\n\n    Options:\n    opa. Fructokinase\nopb. Aldolase A\nopc. Aldolase B\nopd. Sucrase\n\n### Retrieved Similar Medical Knowledge:\n- Enzymes ASSOCIATED_WITH Neonatal Jaundice\n- Enzymes CAUSES Malnutrition\n- Enterocytes INTERACTS_WITH Antibodies\n- Serine TREATS Micrococcus luteus\n- Enzymopathy PREDISPOSES Neonatal Jaundice\n- Enzymes CAUSES Neonatal hypoglycemia\n- Cell Line LOCATION_OF Epipodophyllotoxin\n\n    ### Instructions:\n            - Use standard medical knowledge as the primary guide.\n            - Consider enhanced information only if it aligns with consensus.\n            - If conflicting or unclear, present the most likely correct answer based on known facts.\n            - It's acceptable to show moderate confidence if the question is complex, but still choose one best answer.\n    ### Task:\n                1.

  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"The symptoms presented by the 6-month-old baby, including vomiting, lethargy, and severe jaundice after the introduction of fruit juice, suggest a metabolic disorder related to carbohydrate metabolism. The introduction of fruit juice, which is high in fructose, points towards a potential issue with fructose metabolism. Aldolase B is the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of fructose, and its deficiency leads to hereditary fructose intolerance, which can present with similar symptoms in infants. Fructokinase deficiency (Option opa) does not typically cause severe symptoms, as it leads to benign fructosuria. Aldolase A (Option opb) is not directly related to fructose metabolism. Sucrase (Option opd) is involved in sucrose digestion but is not the primary concern here. Therefore, the most likely defective enzyme in this scenario is Aldolase B (Option opc).\",\n    \"answer\": \"opc\",\n    \"confidence\": 90\n}",
