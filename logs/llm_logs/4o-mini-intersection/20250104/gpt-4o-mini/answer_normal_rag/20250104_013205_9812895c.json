  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"The question asks for the statement that is NOT true concerning amyloidosis. Option 'opa' states that amyloidosis associated with multiple myeloma has the poorest prognosis, which is generally considered true as this type of amyloidosis is often associated with a more aggressive disease course. Option 'opb' correctly identifies fine-needle biopsy of subcutaneous abdominal fat as a reliable method for diagnosing secondary systemic amyloidosis, which is well-supported in medical literature. Option 'opc' states that hepatic amyloid disease produces hepatomegaly but rarely jaundice, which aligns with known clinical presentations of hepatic amyloidosis. Option 'opd' claims that amyloidosis of the spleen is associated with severe anemia; however, while splenic involvement can occur, severe anemia is not a direct or common consequence of splenic amyloidosis. Therefore, 'opd' is the statement that is least accurate regarding amyloidosis.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opd\",\n    \"confidence\": 85\n}",
