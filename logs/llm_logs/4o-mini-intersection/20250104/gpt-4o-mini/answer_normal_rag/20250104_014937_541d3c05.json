  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Among the options provided, chloroquine is known to potentially cause myopathy, particularly in long-term use. Betamethasone, a corticosteroid, can also lead to muscle weakness and myopathy, especially with prolonged use. Chloramphenicol has been associated with various side effects, but myopathy is not a common one. Zidovudine (AZT) is known to cause myopathy and muscle wasting as a side effect. Therefore, chloramphenicol is the drug that does not typically cause myopathy, making it the best-supported option.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opc\",\n    \"confidence\": 85\n}",
