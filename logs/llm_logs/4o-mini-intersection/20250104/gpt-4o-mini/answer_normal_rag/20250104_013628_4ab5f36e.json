  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"The question asks for a 5α reductase inhibitor effective in both benign prostatic hypertrophy and male pattern baldness. Finasteride is well-documented as a 5α reductase inhibitor that treats benign prostatic hypertrophy and is also used for male pattern baldness. The other options do not fit this description: Flutamide is an anti-androgen, Prazosin is an alpha-1 blocker, and Minoxidil is a vasodilator used for hypertension and hair loss but is not a 5α reductase inhibitor. Therefore, the best-supported answer is Finasteride.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opb\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}",
