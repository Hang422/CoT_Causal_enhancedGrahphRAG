  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Aminoglycosides are known to primarily affect the inner hair cells in the cochlea, particularly in the basal area. This is supported by the evidence that aminoglycosides can cause cochlear lesions and sensorineural hearing loss, which are associated with damage to the inner hair cells. The basal area of the cochlea is more susceptible to damage from aminoglycosides compared to the apical area. Therefore, the most likely correct option is that aminoglycosides affect the inner hair cells in the basal area.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opb\",\n    \"confidence\": 90\n}",
