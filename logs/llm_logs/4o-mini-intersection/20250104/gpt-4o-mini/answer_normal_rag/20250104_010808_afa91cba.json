  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Aldosterone is a steroid hormone produced by the adrenal cortex that primarily acts on the kidneys to regulate sodium and potassium balance. It specifically targets the cells in the collecting duct of the nephron, promoting sodium reabsorption and potassium excretion. The other options (glomerulus, proximal convoluted tubule, and loop of Henle) do not represent the primary site of action for aldosterone. Therefore, the best-supported option is the collecting duct.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opa\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}",
