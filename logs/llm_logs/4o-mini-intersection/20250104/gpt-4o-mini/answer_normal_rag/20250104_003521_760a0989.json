  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Among the options provided, fludrocortisone is known to be the most potent mineralocorticoid. Aldosterone is the primary mineralocorticoid produced by the adrenal glands, but fludrocortisone is a synthetic analog that has a stronger effect on sodium retention and potassium excretion. DOCA (deoxycorticosterone acetate) is also a mineralocorticoid but is less potent than fludrocortisone. Triamcinolone is primarily a glucocorticoid and does not have significant mineralocorticoid activity. Therefore, fludrocortisone is the best-supported answer as the most potent mineralocorticoid.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opc\",\n    \"confidence\": 90\n}",
