  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Isoniazid (INH) is known to cause peripheral neuropathy, primarily due to pyridoxine (vitamin B6) deficiency. Pyridoxine is essential for the synthesis of neurotransmitters and the metabolism of amino acids. Supplementation with pyridoxine is a well-established treatment for INH-induced neuropathy, as it helps to alleviate the symptoms associated with the deficiency caused by INH. While thiamine is also associated with treating certain types of neuropathy, it is not the primary treatment for INH-induced neuropathy. Therefore, the best-supported option is pyridoxine.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opb\",\n    \"confidence\": 90\n}",
