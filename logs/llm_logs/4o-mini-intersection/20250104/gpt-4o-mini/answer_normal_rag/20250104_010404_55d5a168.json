  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"The plasma membrane of a cell is connected to the cytoskeleton primarily through proteins that serve as linkers. Spectrin is a cytoskeletal protein that forms a meshwork beneath the plasma membrane and is crucial for maintaining cell shape and integrity. Ankyrin is a protein that anchors spectrin to integral membrane proteins, thus linking the cytoskeleton to the plasma membrane. While tubulin is a component of microtubules and laminin is a glycoprotein found in the extracellular matrix, they do not directly link the plasma membrane to the cytoskeleton in the same manner as spectrin and ankyrin. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is ankyrin, as it specifically serves to connect spectrin to the plasma membrane.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opb\",\n    \"confidence\": 85\n}",
