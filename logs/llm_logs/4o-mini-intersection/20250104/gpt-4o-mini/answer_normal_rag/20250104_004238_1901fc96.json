  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Atropine is a muscarinic receptor antagonist that blocks the effects of acetylcholine at muscarinic receptors. In the context of the options provided: (1) Increased blood pressure caused by nicotine is primarily mediated through nicotinic receptors, which atropine does not block. (2) Increased skeletal muscle strength caused by neostigmine is due to increased acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junction, which is not directly affected by atropine. (3) Bradycardia caused by infusion of acetylcholine is a direct effect of acetylcholine on muscarinic receptors in the heart, which can be effectively blocked by atropine. Therefore, the only option that can be blocked by atropine is bradycardia caused by acetylcholine infusion. The correct answer is not 'All of these' as only one option is valid. Thus, the best-supported answer is opc.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opc\",\n    \"confidence\": 90\n}",
