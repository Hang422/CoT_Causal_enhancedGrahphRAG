  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Cisplatin is known to cause several side effects, including ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity, which are well-documented. The coasting effect is not a recognized side effect of cisplatin; rather, it is associated with other chemotherapeutic agents. Pulmonary fibrosis is not a direct side effect of cisplatin but can occur as a result of other cytotoxic chemotherapies. Therefore, the most accurate answer is that cisplatin does not produce the coasting effect.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opc\",\n    \"confidence\": 90\n}",
