  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"The respiratory center is primarily located in the brainstem, specifically in the medulla oblongata and pons, not the midbrain. It is directly stimulated by a fall in PaO2, but this is not the primary trigger; rather, it is more sensitive to changes in PaCO2. The respiratory center is connected with the cardiac center, as both centers coordinate to maintain homeostasis in response to changes in blood gases. During swallowing, the respiratory center is inhibited to prevent aspiration, which is a protective mechanism. Therefore, the most accurate statement regarding the respiratory center is that it is inhibited during swallowing.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opc\",\n    \"confidence\": 85\n}",
