  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Dobutamine is primarily a beta-1 adrenergic agonist with some beta-2 activity, and it is used as an inotropic agent to increase cardiac output without significantly increasing heart rate, unlike dopamine which can cause pronounced tachycardia due to its effects on beta-1 receptors. Additionally, dobutamine does not activate peripheral dopaminergic receptors, which is a key distinction from dopamine. Therefore, the most accurate statement regarding the differences between dobutamine and dopamine is that dobutamine does not activate peripheral dopaminergic receptors.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opd\",\n    \"confidence\": 90\n}",
