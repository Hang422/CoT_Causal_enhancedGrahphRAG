  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"The drug of choice for managing bleeding esophageal varices is typically Octreotide, which is a somatostatin analogue that reduces portal pressure and helps control bleeding. Ethanolamine oleate is used for sclerotherapy, but it is not the first-line treatment for acute bleeding. Propanolol is used for prophylaxis against variceal bleeding but not for acute management. Phytonadione (Vitamin K) is not relevant in this context. Therefore, based on the consensus in medical literature, Octreotide is the most appropriate choice.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opb\",\n    \"confidence\": 90\n}",
