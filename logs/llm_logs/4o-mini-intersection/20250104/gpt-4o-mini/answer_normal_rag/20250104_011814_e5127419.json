  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Quinine is known to cause a range of side effects, one of which is cinchonism, a syndrome characterized by symptoms such as tinnitus, headache, nausea, and restlessness. The symptoms of restlessness and sweating in this patient are consistent with cinchonism, which is a direct adverse effect of quinine administration. While hypoglycemia could cause restlessness and sweating, it is less likely in this context without additional information suggesting low blood sugar levels. Arrhythmias are a potential concern with quinine, but the specific symptoms described do not directly point to this. Therefore, cinchonism is the most likely cause of the symptoms observed.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opb\",\n    \"confidence\": 90\n}",
