  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Shock is a condition characterized by inadequate blood flow to the tissues, leading to insufficient oxygen delivery. This can result in stagnant hypoxia, where blood flow is reduced, causing a lack of oxygen in the tissues despite normal oxygen content in the blood. The other types of hypoxia listed (anemic, hypoxic, and histotoxic) are less directly related to the primary mechanism of shock, which is primarily about inadequate perfusion rather than issues with blood content or utilization of oxygen. Therefore, stagnant hypoxia is the most appropriate choice in the context of shock.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opa\",\n    \"confidence\": 85\n}",
