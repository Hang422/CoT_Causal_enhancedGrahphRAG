  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Steroids are often used in the treatment of certain complications of tuberculosis, such as meningitis and pericarditis, to reduce inflammation and prevent complications. However, in cases of ileo-caecal tuberculosis, steroids are generally not indicated as they can exacerbate the infection and lead to complications. Adrenal involvement in tuberculosis may also warrant steroid use, particularly if there is adrenal insufficiency. Therefore, the best-supported option for where steroids are not indicated is ileo-caecal tuberculosis.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opc\",\n    \"confidence\": 85\n}",
