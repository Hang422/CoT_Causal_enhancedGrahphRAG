Mouth\nopb. Stomach\nopc. Small intestine\nopd. Large intestine\n\n### Retrieved Similar Medical Knowledge:\n- Arthralgia ASSOCIATED_WITH Polyarthritis\n- Colon LOCATION_OF Disaccharides\n- Exhaustion ASSOCIATED_WITH Lymphohistiocytosis, Hemophagocytic\n- Duodenum LOCATION_OF Disaccharides\n- Digests PROCESS_OF Gut\n- Myocytes, Smooth Muscle INTERACTS_WITH Vascular Endothelial Cells\n- Kinins CAUSES Impairment, cardiovascular\n- Entire nerve LOCATION_OF Stenosis, unspecified\n\n    ### Instructions:\n            - Use standard medical knowledge as the primary guide.\n            - Consider enhanced information only if it aligns with consensus.\n            - If conflicting or unclear, present the most likely correct answer based on known facts.\n            - It's acceptable to show moderate confidence if the question is complex, but still choose one best answer.\n    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3.

  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Disaccharides are primarily digested in the small intestine, specifically by enzymes such as maltase, sucrase, and lactase that break them down into monosaccharides. While some digestion may occur in the mouth due to salivary amylase, the majority of disaccharide digestion occurs in the small intestine, making it the most appropriate answer. The stomach does not play a significant role in disaccharide digestion, and the large intestine is primarily involved in the absorption of water and electrolytes, not carbohydrate digestion.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opc\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}",
