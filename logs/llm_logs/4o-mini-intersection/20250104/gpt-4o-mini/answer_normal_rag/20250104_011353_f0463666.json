Increase in glucagon/insulin ratio, increased CAMP and increased blood glucose\nopb. Decreased insulin, increased free fatty acid which is equivalent to blood glucose\nopc. Decreased insulin, increased free fatty acid which is not equivalent to blood glucose\nopd. Elevated insulin and free fatty acid, equivalent to blood glucose\n\n### Retrieved Similar Medical Knowledge:\n- In situ perfusion ISA Therapeutic procedure\n- PRDM16 PART_OF Saccharomyces cerevisiae\n- Disease PREDISPOSES Diabetic Ketoacidosis\n- Diabetic Ketoacidosis PREDISPOSES Diabetes\n- Starvation CAUSES Diabetic Ketoacidosis\n- GPR18 INTERACTS_WITH Cells\n- Blood Vessels LOCATION_OF Parkinsonian Disorders\n- Symptoms PREDISPOSES Diabetic Ketoacidosis\n\n    ### Instructions:\n            - Use standard medical knowledge as the primary guide.\n            - Consider enhanced information only if it aligns with consensus.\n            - If conflicting or unclear, present the most likely correct answer based on known facts.\n            - It's acceptable to show moderate confidence if the question is complex, but still choose one best answer.\n    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3.

  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"In diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), there is a significant decrease in insulin levels, which leads to increased lipolysis and subsequently elevated free fatty acids. This process results in the production of ketone bodies, causing ketoacidosis. The glucagon/insulin ratio is increased due to low insulin levels, which also contributes to hyperglycemia. Therefore, the most accurate option is one that reflects decreased insulin, increased free fatty acids, and acknowledges that these changes are not equivalent to blood glucose levels, as blood glucose remains elevated due to insulin deficiency. Thus, option opc is the best choice as it correctly describes the metabolic state in DKA due to diabetes mellitus.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opc\",\n    \"confidence\": 90\n}",
