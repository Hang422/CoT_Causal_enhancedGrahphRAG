  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Growth hormone (GH) primarily exerts its effects on growth through the stimulation of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) production in the liver and other tissues. IGF-1 is a key mediator of the anabolic effects of growth hormone, promoting cell growth and division. While growth hormone can have direct effects on certain tissues, its major role in growth is through IGF-1. Therefore, the most accurate answer is that growth hormone has its effect on growth through IGF-1.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opb\",\n    \"confidence\": 90\n}",
