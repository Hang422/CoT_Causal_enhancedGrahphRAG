  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Glycoproteins are characterized by the presence of carbohydrate moieties attached to a core protein. The core protein is essential for the structure and function of glycoproteins. The statement 'Protein linked with glycosidic bond' (option opa) is partially correct, as glycoproteins do involve glycosidic bonds, but it does not fully capture the essence of glycoproteins. Option opb, 'Core protein', accurately reflects a fundamental characteristic of glycoproteins, as they consist of a core protein to which carbohydrate chains are attached. Option opc, 'Sugar residues are long in carbohydrate portion of glycoprotein', is misleading because glycoproteins can have varying lengths of sugar residues, and they are not necessarily long. Therefore, the best-supported option is opb, which directly identifies the core protein as a defining feature of glycoproteins.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opb\",\n    \"confidence\": 85\n}",
