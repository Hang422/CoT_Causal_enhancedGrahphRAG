Azithromycin is commonly used for treating non-gonococcal urethritis, while ceftriaxone is the recommended treatment for gonococcal urethritis. However, among the options provided, Azithromycin is the most appropriate choice as it is effective against Chlamydia, which is often associated with non-gonococcal urethritis. The other options do not align with the standard treatment protocols for these conditions.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opd\",\n    \"confidence\": 85\n}",
