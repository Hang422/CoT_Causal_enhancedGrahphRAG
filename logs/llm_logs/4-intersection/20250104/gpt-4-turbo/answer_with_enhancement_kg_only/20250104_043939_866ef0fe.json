It is more common with huminsulin\nopb. It may occur in the presence of infections\nopc. It may be due to antibodies to insulin\nopd. Use of glucocorticoids may be useful in severe cases\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nAmong the provided options, the statement that insulin resistance is more common with Huminsulin is incorrect, as synthetic human insulins like Huminsulin do not generally show a higher incidence of insulin resistance compared to other insulin types. Infections can increase insulin resistance through a stress-induced increase in counter-regulatory hormones. Antibodies to insulin can also lead to increased insulin resistance by reducing insulin efficacy. However, the use of glucocorticoids, which increase blood glucose levels and worsen insulin resistance, is not useful in severe cases of insulin resistance, contradicting the option suggesting their utility.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Analyzing the provided options in the context of insulin resistance in diabetic patients: Option opa suggests that insulin resistance is more common with Huminsulin, which is a synthetic human insulin. Medical consensus indicates that synthetic human insulins, including Huminsulin, do not generally show a higher incidence of insulin resistance compared to other types of insulin. Option opb states that insulin resistance may occur in the presence of infections, which is accurate as infections can increase insulin resistance through stress-induced hormonal changes. Option opc mentions that insulin resistance may be due to antibodies to insulin, which is also correct because antibodies can interfere with insulin's action, thereby increasing resistance. Option opd suggests that the use of glucocorticoids may be useful in severe cases of insulin resistance. However, glucocorticoids are known to increase blood glucose levels and exacerbate insulin resistance, making them counterproductive in managing insulin resistance. Therefore, the statement in option opd is incorrect based on standard medical knowledge.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
