Vitamin A\nopb. Vitamin C\nopc. Vitamin D\nopd. Vitamin B12\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nAmong the vitamins listed, Vitamin D is the most supported by consensus for reducing the risk of insulin resistance, obesity, and metabolic syndrome. Vitamin D enhances insulin sensitivity, which is crucial in managing and preventing insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome, as supported by the evidence path linking insulin sensitivity to predisposing metabolic syndrome. Vitamin A's role in fat cell development and Vitamin C's antioxidant properties, while beneficial for general health, have less direct and robust evidence linking them to significant reductions in obesity or metabolic syndrome. Vitamin B12, important for nerve function and metabolism, does not have a direct established link to reducing insulin resistance or obesity. Therefore, Vitamin D stands out as the most effective in this context based on its direct impact on enhancing insulin sensitivity and reducing associated risks.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The question focuses on identifying which vitamin among the listed options reduces the risk of insulin resistance, obesity, and metabolic syndrome. Based on standard medical knowledge and consensus, Vitamin D is recognized for its role in enhancing insulin sensitivity. This is crucial for managing and preventing insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome. The evidence linking Vitamin D to these health benefits is more direct and robust compared to the other vitamins listed. Vitamin A and Vitamin C, while beneficial for overall health, do not have as strong and direct evidence linking them to significant reductions in obesity or metabolic syndrome. Vitamin B12, important for nerve function and metabolism, similarly lacks a direct established link to reducing insulin resistance or obesity. Therefore, based on the available evidence and consensus, Vitamin D is the most likely correct answer as it directly impacts insulin sensitivity and reduces associated risks.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opc\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}",
