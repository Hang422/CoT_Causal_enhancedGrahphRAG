Protein linked with glycosidic bond\nopb. Core protein\nopc. Sugar residues are long in carbohydrate poion of glycoprotein\nopd. None\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nGlycoproteins are characterized by a core protein structure and glycosidic bonds that attach carbohydrate groups to this protein. These features are essential for their biological functions and structural integrity. While glycoproteins can have varying lengths of carbohydrate chains, the length is not a defining characteristic. The options describing the core protein and the glycosidic bond linkage accurately reflect the fundamental characteristics of glycoproteins.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Glycoproteins are proteins that have carbohydrate groups attached to the polypeptide chain. The attachment of these carbohydrate groups to the protein is typically through glycosidic bonds, which is a fundamental characteristic of glycoproteins. Additionally, glycoproteins indeed have a core protein structure, which is essential for their function and structural integrity. The length of the carbohydrate chains can vary and is not a defining characteristic of glycoproteins, making option opc less relevant in defining glycoproteins. Therefore, the options that best describe the characteristics of glycoproteins are those mentioning the core protein structure and the glycosidic bond linkage. Given that option opa specifically mentions the glycosidic bond, which is a critical and defining feature of glycoproteins, it aligns closely with the standard medical understanding of glycoprotein structure.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}",
