Aldosterone\nopb. DOCA\nopc. Fludrocoeisone\nopd. Triamcinolone\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nAldosterone is the most potent mineralocorticoid, primarily produced by the adrenal cortex and known for its strong effect on sodium reabsorption and potassium excretion by binding to mineralocorticoid receptors. This is supported by evidence showing Aldosterone's role as part of the adrenal cortex and its interaction with mineralocorticoid receptors. Fludrocortisone, although a synthetic corticosteroid with a strong affinity for mineralocorticoid receptors and used for its potent mineralocorticoid properties, is second to aldosterone in potency. DOCA, another synthetic corticosteroid, binds to mineralocorticoid receptors but is less potent than aldosterone in terms of sodium retention. Triamcinolone, primarily noted for its glucocorticoid activity, has minimal mineralocorticoid effects and is not considered potent in this regard. The evidence paths confirm the specific interactions of aldosterone with mineralocorticoid receptors and its location in the adrenal cortex, reinforcing its role as the most potent mineralocorticoid.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Aldosterone is recognized as the most potent mineralocorticoid, primarily produced by the adrenal cortex. It plays a crucial role in regulating sodium reabsorption and potassium excretion by binding to mineralocorticoid receptors. Fludrocortisone, while also a strong mineralocorticoid, is synthetic and generally considered second to aldosterone in terms of potency. DOCA, another synthetic option, does not match aldosterone's potency in sodium retention. Triamcinolone is mainly a glucocorticoid with minimal mineralocorticoid effects, making it the least potent in this context. The consensus in medical literature and pharmacological understanding supports aldosterone as the most potent mineralocorticoid due to its natural production and significant physiological effects.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
