Can be used in absence seizures\nopb. Can be mixed with saline\nopc. Can be given orally\nopd. It is the drug of choice for myoclonic seizures\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nFosphenytoin, unlike phenytoin, can be safely mixed with saline for IV administration, reducing the risk of precipitation and phlebitis. It is not intended for oral use, aligning with its design for parenteral administration. Both fosphenytoin and phenytoin are not effective for absence seizures and are not the drugs of choice for myoclonic seizures.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Fosphenytoin and phenytoin are both anticonvulsants used primarily in the treatment of seizures. The key difference between fosphenytoin and phenytoin lies in their formulation and administration properties. Fosphenytoin is a prodrug of phenytoin, designed to improve the safety and ease of intravenous administration. It can be mixed with saline, which is a significant advantage over phenytoin, as mixing phenytoin with saline can lead to precipitation and complications such as phlebitis. This property of fosphenytoin aligns with the enhanced information provided and is supported by standard medical knowledge. Both drugs are not indicated for absence seizures or myoclonic seizures, and neither is available for oral administration in the form of fosphenytoin. Therefore, the most accurate answer based on the options provided and the consensus in medical literature is that fosphenytoin can be mixed with saline.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
