Chlorothiazide\nopb. Beta blockers\nopc. ACE inhibitors\nopd. Amlodipine\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nACE inhibitors are contraindicated with spironolactone due to the increased risk of hyperkalemia from elevated blood potassium levels. This interaction is well-documented and generally advised against unless under strict medical supervision.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Spironolactone is a potassium-sparing diuretic commonly used in the treatment of conditions like heart failure, hypertension, and conditions of excess aldosterone. One of the primary concerns with spironolactone is its potential to cause hyperkalemia, an elevated level of potassium in the blood, which can be dangerous. ACE inhibitors, which are used for similar indications as spironolactone, also have a propensity to increase serum potassium levels. When used together, spironolactone and ACE inhibitors can significantly increase the risk of hyperkalemia, which can lead to serious cardiac complications. This interaction is well-documented in medical literature and clinical practice guidelines typically advise against the concurrent use of these drugs unless under careful monitoring and consideration. Therefore, based on the consensus and the enhanced information provided, ACE inhibitors are contraindicated with spironolactone due to the increased risk of hyperkalemia.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opc\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
