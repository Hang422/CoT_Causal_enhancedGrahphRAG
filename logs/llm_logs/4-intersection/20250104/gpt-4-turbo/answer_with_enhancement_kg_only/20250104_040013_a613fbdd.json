Adenylyl cyclase\nopc. Na+-K+-ATPase\nopd. Galactosyl transferase\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nAmong the options provided, 5'-nucleotidase, Adenylyl cyclase, and Na+-K+-ATPase are confirmed enzymatic markers of the plasma membrane, supported by their biochemical roles and interactions. Galactosyl transferase, primarily associated with the Golgi apparatus, is not a plasma membrane marker and is the correct answer to the question.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "### Core Medical Principle\nThe core medical principle involved here is the identification of specific enzymes that are characteristic markers of the plasma membrane in cells. These markers are crucial for understanding cellular functions such as signal transduction, ion transport, and energy transduction.\n\n### Analysis of Options\n- **5'-nucleotidase**: This enzyme is well-known for its role in the hydrolysis of nucleotides and is located on the outer surface of the plasma membrane. It is a marker for plasma membrane integrity and function.\n  \n- **Adenylyl cyclase**: This enzyme is integral to the plasma membrane and catalyzes the conversion of ATP to cyclic AMP, a critical second messenger in signal transduction pathways.\n  \n- **Na+-K+-ATPase**: This is a pivotal enzyme in maintaining the electrochemical gradient across the plasma membrane by pumping sodium out of and potassium into the cell. It is a well-established plasma membrane marker.\n  \n- **Galactosyl transferase**: Typically associated with the Golgi apparatus, this enzyme functions primarily in the synthesis of glycoproteins by transferring galactose to growing sugar chains. Its primary association is not with the plasma membrane but with the Golgi apparatus.\n\n### Conclusion\nBased on the standard medical knowledge and the roles of these enzymes in cellular physiology, 5'-nucleotidase, Adenylyl cyclase, and Na+-K+-ATPase are confirmed markers of the plasma membrane. Galactosyl transferase, however, is primarily linked with the Golgi apparatus and not the plasma membrane. Therefore, it is the correct answer to the question as it is not an enzymatic marker of the plasma membrane.\n\n### Final Analysis and Confidence Score\nThe analysis prioritizes medical consensus regarding the localization and function of these enzymes within cellular structures. The identification of Galactosyl transferase as primarily a Golgi apparatus enzyme, rather than a plasma membrane marker, is supported by standard cellular biology and physiology texts. Thus, the answer is based on well-established medical knowledge.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Based on the established roles of the enzymes listed, Galactosyl transferase is correctly identified as not being a plasma membrane marker but rather associated with the Golgi apparatus. This conclusion aligns with standard medical and physiological consensus.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
