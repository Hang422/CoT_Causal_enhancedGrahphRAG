Fibrinolysis\nopb. Activation of collagenase\nopc. Destruction of VWF\nopd. Stabilization of fibrin\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nPlasmin functions include fibrinolysis, activation of collagenase, and destruction of VWF. It does not stabilize fibrin, as its primary role involves breaking down fibrin, not stabilizing it. Evidence paths confirm plasmin's interaction with VWF, supporting its role in VWF degradation.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Plasmin is primarily known for its role in fibrinolysis, where it breaks down fibrin clots, a process crucial in the regulation of blood clotting. This aligns with the function described in option 'opa'. Additionally, plasmin is involved in the activation of other proteases such as collagenase, as indicated in option 'opb', which is part of its role in tissue remodeling and healing processes. Option 'opc' mentions the destruction of von Willebrand factor (VWF), which is consistent with plasmin's function in modulating components of the coagulation cascade, including the degradation of VWF to regulate clot formation and stability. Conversely, option 'opd' states that plasmin stabilizes fibrin, which contradicts its fundamental role in fibrinolysis. Plasmin's primary action is to degrade fibrin, not to stabilize it. Therefore, based on standard medical knowledge and the functions typically attributed to plasmin, option 'opd' is the incorrect statement about the functions of plasmin.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
