Nimodipine\nopb. Amlodipine\nopc. Diltiazem\nopd. Verapamil\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nNimodipine is the most appropriate drug indicated for subarachnoid hemorrhage primarily due to its specific effectiveness in preventing cerebral vasospasm, a common and serious complication of subarachnoid hemorrhage. While Amlodipine, Diltiazem, and Verapamil are also calcium channel blockers, their effectiveness and specificity for treating cerebral vasospasm in the context of subarachnoid hemorrhage are not as well established as that of Nimodipine. The evidence supports Nimodipine's higher specificity for cerebral arteries, making it the preferred choice for this indication.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The core medical principle in treating subarachnoid hemorrhage involves the prevention of cerebral vasospasm, a potentially life-threatening complication. Among the options provided, Nimodipine, Amlodipine, Diltiazem, and Verapamil are all calcium channel blockers, but their efficacy and specificity in the context of subarachnoid hemorrhage vary. Nimodipine is specifically indicated for the prevention of cerebral vasospasm following subarachnoid hemorrhage, supported by clinical evidence and medical consensus. Its ability to selectively target cerebral arteries enhances its effectiveness for this particular indication. The other drugs listed, while also being calcium channel blockers, do not have the same level of evidence or recommendation for this specific use. Therefore, based on the consensus and the specific pharmacological action of Nimodipine, it is the most appropriate choice for treating subarachnoid hemorrhage.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
