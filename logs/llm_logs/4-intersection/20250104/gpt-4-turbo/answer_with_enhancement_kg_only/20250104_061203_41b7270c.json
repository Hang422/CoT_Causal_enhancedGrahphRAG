Abciximab\nopb. Eptifibatide\nopc. Tirofiban\nopd. Prasugrel\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nAbciximab, Eptifibatide, and Tirofiban are correctly identified as Gp2b3A inhibitors, which block the glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor on platelets to prevent aggregation. Prasugrel, however, is not a Gp2b3A inhibitor; it belongs to the thienopyridine class and inhibits platelet activation by blocking ADP receptors, not the glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor. Therefore, Prasugrel is the correct answer to the question as it is not a Gp2b3A inhibitor.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "### Core Medical Principle:\nGp2b3A inhibitors are a class of antiplatelet drugs that specifically target and block the glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor on the surface of platelets. This action prevents platelet aggregation, which is a crucial step in the formation of blood clots. The drugs commonly recognized as Gp2b3A inhibitors include Abciximab, Eptifibatide, and Tirofiban.\n\n### Analysis of Options:\n- **Abciximab (opa)**: It is a well-known Gp2b3A inhibitor used to prevent platelets from aggregating by blocking the glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor.\n- **Eptifibatide (opb)**: Similar to Abciximab, Eptifibatide is a Gp2b3A inhibitor that acts on the same receptor to prevent platelet aggregation.\n- **Tirofiban (opc)**: This medication also belongs to the Gp2b3A inhibitor class, targeting the glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor.\n- **Prasugrel (opd)**: Unlike the other options, Prasugrel is not a Gp2b3A inhibitor. It is a thienopyridine class drug that inhibits platelet activation by blocking ADP receptors, not the glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor.\n\n### Final Analysis:\nBased on the standard medical knowledge and the specific actions of the drugs listed, it is clear that Prasugrel does not belong to the Gp2b3A inhibitors class. The other three options (Abciximab, Eptifibatide, and Tirofiban) are correctly classified as Gp2b3A inhibitors. Therefore, the correct answer to the question \"Gp2b3A inhibitors are all except\" is Prasugrel.\n\n### Confidence Score:\nGiven the clear distinction in the mechanism of action between Prasugrel and the other listed drugs, and the consensus in medical literature regarding their classifications, the confidence in this answer is high.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Prasugrel is not a Gp2b3A inhibitor but rather a thienopyridine that blocks ADP receptors, distinguishing it from the other options which are all Gp2b3A inhibitors.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 98\n}\n```",
