Selenium\nopb. Phosphorus\nopc. Boron\nopd. Zinc\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nSelenium deficiency is the most directly linked to cardiomyopathy among the options, due to its crucial role in antioxidant defense and protecting heart cells from oxidative stress, a recognized pathogenic mechanism in cardiomyopathy. Other nutrient deficiencies, while potentially affecting heart health, do not show as direct or well-documented connections to cardiomyopathy as selenium.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Among the options provided, selenium deficiency is most directly linked to cardiomyopathy. Selenium plays a critical role in the body's antioxidant defense system, particularly in the heart, where it helps to protect cells from oxidative stress. Oxidative stress is a well-documented pathogenic mechanism in various forms of cardiomyopathy. Deficiencies in other nutrients like phosphorus, boron, and zinc, while potentially impacting overall health and possibly heart function, do not have as direct or well-established links to cardiomyopathy as selenium deficiency does. Therefore, based on the consensus in medical literature and the enhanced information provided, selenium deficiency is the most likely cause of cardiomyopathy among the given options.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}",
