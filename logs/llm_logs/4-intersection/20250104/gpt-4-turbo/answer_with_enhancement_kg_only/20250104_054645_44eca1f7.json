Tamsulosin\nopb. Prazosin\nopc. Oxazocin\nopd. Dolazoline\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nTamsulosin, an alpha-1 adrenergic blocker, is specifically effective in providing symptomatic relief in benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) by relaxing smooth muscles in the bladder neck and prostate, which improves urine flow. Prazosin, also an alpha-1 blocker, is less selective towards bladder and prostate tissues and primarily used for hypertension, thus offering possible but less targeted relief in BPH symptoms. Oxazocin and Dolazoline are not recognized medications and have no established effects on BPH. The evidence paths confirm the role of pharmaceutical preparations in treating BPH and the importance of smooth muscle relaxation in the bladder and prostate for alleviating symptoms, supporting the use of Tamsulosin specifically for BPH.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The question pertains to identifying an alpha-1 adrenergic blocker that provides symptomatic relief in benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Among the options provided, Tamsulosin is well-recognized and specifically indicated for the treatment of BPH. It works by selectively targeting the alpha-1 receptors in the prostate and bladder neck, leading to muscle relaxation and improved urine flow, which is crucial for alleviating symptoms of BPH. Prazosin, while also an alpha-1 blocker, is primarily used for managing hypertension and is less selective for prostate tissue, making it a less ideal choice for BPH compared to Tamsulosin. The other two options, Oxazocin and Dolazoline, do not correspond to recognized medications for BPH or are not well-documented in medical literature, rendering them irrelevant for this query. Based on the consensus in medical guidelines and pharmacological efficacy, Tamsulosin is the most appropriate and effective choice for providing symptomatic relief in BPH.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
