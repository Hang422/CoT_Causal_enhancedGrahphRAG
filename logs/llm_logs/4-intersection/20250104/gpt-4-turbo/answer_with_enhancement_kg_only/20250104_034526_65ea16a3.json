Vitamin A\nopb. Vitamin B\nopc. Vitamin C\nopd. Vitamin E\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nNyctalopia, commonly known as night blindness, is primarily caused by a deficiency in Vitamin A. This deficiency leads to reduced production of rhodopsin, a pigment essential for vision in low-light conditions. The evidence paths confirm that Vitamin A deficiency is associated with pathogenic changes affecting rhodopsin, which directly supports the link between Vitamin A deficiency and nyctalopia. In contrast, deficiencies in Vitamins B, C, and E, while they can affect eye health through mechanisms like neurological symptoms, increased oxidative stress, and potential retinal damage, do not have a direct, well-established link to the specific condition of nyctalopia. Therefore, the most accurate and consensus-aligned answer to the question is Vitamin A.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Nyctalopia, also known as night blindness, is primarily associated with a deficiency in Vitamin A. This is because Vitamin A is crucial for the synthesis of rhodopsin, a pigment found in the retina that is essential for low-light vision. Deficiencies in other vitamins such as B, C, and E can impact overall eye health but do not directly cause nyctalopia. The medical consensus strongly supports the link between Vitamin A deficiency and the development of nyctalopia, making this the most accurate answer based on current knowledge.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
