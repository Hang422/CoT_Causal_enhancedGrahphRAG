Streptomycin\nopb. Ethambutol\nopc. Capreomycin\nopd. Rifampicin\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nRifampicin, primarily metabolized by the liver, is the safest antitubercular drug for use in severe renal failure. Ethambutol can be used with careful monitoring and dose adjustments. Streptomycin and Capreomycin, both primarily excreted by the kidneys, pose higher risks and are generally less suitable for patients with severe renal failure.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"In addressing the question of which antitubercular drug can be safely used in severe renal failure, it is crucial to consider the pharmacokinetics of each drug. Streptomycin and Capreomycin are primarily excreted by the kidneys, which makes them less suitable for patients with severe renal failure due to the risk of accumulation and toxicity. Ethambutol is also excreted renally but can be used with dose adjustments and careful monitoring. However, Rifampicin is primarily metabolized by the liver and only a minor fraction is excreted unchanged in the urine, making it the safest option among the listed drugs for patients with severe renal failure. This aligns with standard medical knowledge and consensus on the metabolism and excretion pathways of these drugs.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
