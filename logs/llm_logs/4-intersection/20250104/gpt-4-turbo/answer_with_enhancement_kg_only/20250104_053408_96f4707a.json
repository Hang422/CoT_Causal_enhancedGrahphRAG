Endometrial carcinoma\nopc. >Carcinoma in contralateral breast\nopd. >Cataract\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nTamoxifen, a selective estrogen receptor modulator, increases the risk of thromboembolism and endometrial carcinoma due to its estrogen-like effects on the liver and endometrial stimulation, respectively. It also potentially increases the risk of cataract formation by interfering with lipid metabolism affecting lens proteins. However, tamoxifen reduces the risk of carcinoma in the contralateral breast, contrary to causing it, by decreasing estrogen effects in breast tissue.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Tamoxifen is a selective estrogen receptor modulator commonly used in the treatment of estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer. It has several known adverse effects due to its complex interactions with estrogen receptors in various tissues. Thromboembolism is a recognized risk because tamoxifen exhibits estrogen-like effects on the liver, which can alter the coagulation pathway favoring clot formation. Endometrial carcinoma risk is increased due to tamoxifen's agonistic effects on the endometrial lining, stimulating its growth. Cataract formation is also a documented side effect, potentially due to tamoxifen's interference with lipid metabolism in the eye's lens. Contrarily, tamoxifen is known to reduce the risk of developing carcinoma in the contralateral (opposite) breast. This protective effect is due to its anti-estrogenic effects in breast tissue, which help prevent the development of new breast cancer cells. Therefore, the option stating that tamoxifen causes carcinoma in the contralateral breast is incorrect, as it actually reduces this risk.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opc\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
