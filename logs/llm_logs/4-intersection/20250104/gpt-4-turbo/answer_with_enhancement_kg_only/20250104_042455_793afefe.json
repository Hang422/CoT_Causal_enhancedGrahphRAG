Anti depressants\nopb. Anti psychotics\nopc. Anti epileptics\nopd. Mood stabilizers\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nSchizophrenia is primarily treated with antipsychotic medications, which effectively reduce psychotic symptoms by blocking dopamine receptors and addressing neurotransmitter imbalances. While antidepressants, mood stabilizers, and antiepileptics may be used to manage specific co-occurring symptoms, they do not impact the core psychotic symptoms significantly. Evidence supports that antipsychotics are directly associated with the prevention and reduction of schizophrenia's primary symptoms.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Schizophrenia is a psychiatric disorder characterized primarily by symptoms such as hallucinations, delusions, and disorganized thinking. The core treatment for schizophrenia involves the use of antipsychotic medications. These medications are effective in reducing psychotic symptoms by targeting neurotransmitter systems, particularly dopamine. Antidepressants, mood stabilizers, and antiepileptics may be used adjunctively to treat co-occurring symptoms such as depression, mood fluctuations, or seizure disorders, but they do not address the primary psychotic symptoms of schizophrenia. Therefore, based on medical consensus and the enhanced information provided, antipsychotics are the most appropriate and direct treatment for the core symptoms of schizophrenia.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
