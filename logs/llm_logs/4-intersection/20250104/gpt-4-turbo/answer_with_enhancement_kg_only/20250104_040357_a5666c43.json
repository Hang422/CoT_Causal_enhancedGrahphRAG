Proximal tubule\nopb. Distal tubules\nopc. Loop of Henle\nopd. Collecting duct\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nAldosterone primarily acts on the distal tubules of the kidney by binding to mineralocorticoid receptors, leading to increased sodium reabsorption and potassium excretion. This action helps regulate electrolyte balance and blood pressure. While aldosterone also affects the collecting duct, its primary site of action is the distal tubules.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Aldosterone is a hormone that plays a crucial role in the regulation of electrolyte and fluid balance by acting on the kidney. Its primary mechanism involves the regulation of sodium and potassium levels. Aldosterone acts mainly on the distal tubules and the collecting ducts of the nephron. It binds to mineralocorticoid receptors in the distal tubules, leading to increased reabsorption of sodium and secretion of potassium. This action helps in maintaining blood pressure and electrolyte balance. While aldosterone also has effects on the collecting duct, the consensus in medical literature points to its predominant action on the distal tubules. Therefore, based on the standard medical knowledge and the enhanced information provided, the most accurate answer is that aldosterone primarily acts on the distal tubules.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
