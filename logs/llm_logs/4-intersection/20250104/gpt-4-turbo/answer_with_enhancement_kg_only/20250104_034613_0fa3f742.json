Thiamine\nopb. Pyridoxine\nopc. Niacin\nopd. Riboflavin\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nINH (isoniazid) is known to cause neuropathy primarily through its interference with the metabolism of pyridoxine (vitamin B6), leading to its depletion. This depletion results in nerve damage and subsequent neuropathy. Supplementation with pyridoxine is the standard treatment to counteract this effect, as it replenishes vitamin B6, restores normal nerve function, and reduces symptoms of neuropathy. The evidence paths confirm that pyridoxine treats neuropathy and is associated with the uptake processes affected by isoniazid. Other vitamins like thiamine, niacin, and riboflavin do not have clear, direct evidence supporting their use in treating INH-induced neuropathy, and their roles in this specific condition remain uncertain or unsupported by current medical consensus.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"INH (isoniazid) is a medication commonly used to treat tuberculosis, but it can cause neuropathy as a side effect by interfering with the metabolism of pyridoxine (vitamin B6). This interference leads to a depletion of vitamin B6, which is crucial for nerve health and function. The standard medical treatment for preventing or addressing INH-induced neuropathy involves supplementing with pyridoxine to counteract the depletion caused by INH. This supplementation helps restore the normal levels of vitamin B6, thereby reducing the risk and severity of neuropathy. The other vitamins listed (thiamine, niacin, and riboflavin) do not have a direct or well-supported role in treating INH-induced neuropathy according to current medical consensus and available evidence.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
