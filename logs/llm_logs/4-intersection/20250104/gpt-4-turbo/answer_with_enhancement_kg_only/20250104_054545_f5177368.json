Retinol\nopb. Retinal\nopc. Retinoic acids\nopd. All of the above\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nVitamin A is essential for multiple physiological functions through its metabolites: retinol, retinal, and retinoic acids. Retinol supports skin, vision, and immune health; retinal is crucial for low-light vision; and retinoic acids regulate gene expression and cellular differentiation. The correct answer to the function of vitamin A is 'All of the above,' reflecting the significant roles of each form.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Vitamin A is a crucial nutrient that plays multiple roles in the human body through its different metabolites: retinol, retinal, and retinoic acids. Retinol is primarily involved in supporting skin health, vision, and immune function. Retinal is essential for vision, particularly in low-light conditions as it is a component of the visual pigment rhodopsin. Retinoic acids are involved in gene expression and the regulation of cellular differentiation and growth. Given that each of these metabolites contributes to the overarching functions of vitamin A, the most accurate answer that encompasses all these aspects is 'All of the above.' This choice aligns with the standard medical understanding of the diverse roles of vitamin A and its metabolites in human physiology.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
