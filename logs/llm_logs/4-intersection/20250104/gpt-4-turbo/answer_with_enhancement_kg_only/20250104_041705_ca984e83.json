Single dose in ascariasis\nopb. Immunostimulant\nopc. Paralysis of worms by depolarisation\nopd. Immunodepressant in high doses\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nLevamisole is effectively used as an anthelmintic for ascariasis and acts as an immunostimulant. It paralyzes worms through hyperpolarization of their muscle membranes. There is insufficient evidence to support its use as an immunodepressant at high doses, making this the correct answer to the question of what Levamisole is not used for.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "### Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\n1. **Understanding Levamisole's Uses**:\n   - **Single Dose in Ascariasis**: Levamisole is known to be effective as an anthelmintic, particularly for treating ascariasis. It is commonly used in a single dose to treat this condition.\n   - **Immunostimulant**: Levamisole has properties that enhance immune responses. It is used to stimulate immune function in various clinical settings.\n   - **Paralysis of Worms by Depolarization**: Levamisole acts on the neuromuscular system of worms, causing paralysis. However, it is important to note that the mechanism involves hyperpolarization rather than depolarization. This is a slight technical error in the options provided but does not change the overall use of Levamisole as an anthelmintic.\n\n2. **Evaluating the Immunodepressant Claim**:\n   - **Immunodepressant in High Doses**: The claim that Levamisole acts as an immunodepressant at high doses is not supported by standard medical literature or consensus. Levamisole is primarily known and used for its immunostimulating properties. While many drugs can have complex effects at varying doses, there is no substantial evidence or common clinical practice supporting the use of Levamisole as an immunodepressant.\n\n3. **Conclusion Based on Medical Consensus**:\n   - The most likely incorrect use of Levamisole, based on the options provided and standard medical knowledge, is as an immunodepressant. This aligns with the lack of evidence for such use in clinical practice or literature.\n\n### Final Analysis and Confidence Score\nGiven the analysis above and the alignment with medical consensus, the answer is that Levamisole is not used as an immunodepressant in high doses. The confidence in this conclusion is high due to the clear support from medical literature and practice regarding the primary uses of Levamisole.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Levamisole is known to be used as an anthelmintic and immunostimulant, and it paralyzes worms through hyperpolarization.
