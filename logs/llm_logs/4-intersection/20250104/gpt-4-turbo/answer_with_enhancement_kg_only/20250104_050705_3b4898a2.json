Meningitis\nopb. Pericarditis\nopc. Ileo-caecal tuberculosis\nopd. Adrenal involvement\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nSteroids are indicated in tuberculosis meningitis, pericarditis, and adrenal involvement to manage inflammation and replace insufficient hormones, respectively. However, they are not typically required in ileo-caecal tuberculosis, where localized intestinal inflammation is primarily treated with anti-tuberculosis medications and possibly surgery.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "### Core Medical Principle:\nSteroids are used in the treatment of certain forms of tuberculosis primarily to reduce inflammation and manage complications that are potentially life-threatening or could lead to significant morbidity. The use of steroids is based on their ability to modulate the immune response and prevent severe inflammatory reactions.\n\n### Analysis:\n- **Meningitis (opa)**: Tuberculosis meningitis is a severe form of tuberculosis where inflammation of the meninges can lead to serious complications. Steroids are used to reduce this inflammation and prevent complications such as hydrocephalus and permanent neurological damage. This is a well-established treatment protocol.\n  \n- **Pericarditis (opb)**: In tuberculous pericarditis, steroids are used to manage inflammation of the pericardium, which can lead to constrictive pericarditis or cardiac tamponade if not treated effectively. The use of steroids in this context is also well-supported by medical literature.\n  \n- **Adrenal involvement (opd)**: Tuberculosis can lead to adrenal insufficiency (Addison's disease) when it involves the adrenal glands. Steroids are crucial here not just for reducing inflammation but also for replacing the hormones that the damaged adrenal glands might no longer be able to produce adequately.\n  \n- **Ileo-caecal tuberculosis (opc)**: This form involves the ileocecal region of the gastrointestinal tract. The primary treatment is anti-tuberculosis medications, and surgery may be required in cases of obstruction, perforation, or abscess formation. Steroids are not typically indicated for managing localized intestinal inflammation in ileo-caecal tuberculosis unless there is a specific complication necessitating their use.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBased on the standard medical guidelines and the roles of steroids in managing various tuberculosis complications, steroids are not typically indicated in ileo-caecal tuberculosis unless there are specific complications. This aligns with the enhanced information provided and the consensus in medical practice.\n\n### Final Output:\n```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Steroids are crucial in managing severe inflammatory responses and hormonal deficiencies in certain forms of tuberculosis such as meningitis, pericarditis, and adrenal involvement. However, in ileo-caecal tuberculosis, the primary treatment involves anti-tuberculosis drugs and possibly surgery, with steroids not generally indicated unless specific complications arise that require their use.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opc\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
