Ca transporter\nopb. Cu transporter\nopc. Zn transporter\nopd. Se transporter\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nMenke's Kinky Hair Syndrome is a genetic disorder caused by a defect in the ATP7A gene, which is crucial for copper transport. This defect leads to impaired copper transport, resulting in a copper transporter defect. The syndrome is characterized by symptoms such as brittle, kinky hair, connective tissue abnormalities, neurological issues, and developmental delays, all of which are linked to copper imbalance in the body. The evidence paths confirm Menke's Kinky Hair Syndrome as a hereditary disease associated with genes and complications, supporting the genetic basis and the involvement of copper transport in the disorder.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Menke's Kinky Hair Syndrome is a genetic disorder characterized by a defect in the ATP7A gene, which is responsible for copper transport. This defect leads to impaired copper transport and accumulation, causing various symptoms including brittle, kinky hair, connective tissue abnormalities, and neurological issues. The disorder's link to copper transport is well-documented and aligns with the consensus in medical literature and genetic research. Therefore, the correct answer is that Menke's Kinky Hair Syndrome is due to a defect in a copper transporter.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 98\n}",
