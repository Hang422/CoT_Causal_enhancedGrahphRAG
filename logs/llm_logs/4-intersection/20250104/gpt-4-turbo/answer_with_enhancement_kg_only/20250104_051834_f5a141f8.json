Hyponatremia\nopb. Hyperkalemia\nopc. Hypoglycemia\nopd. Metabolic alkalosis\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nAdrenal insufficiency leads to hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, and hypoglycemia due to decreased production of aldosterone and cortisol. It does not cause metabolic alkalosis; instead, it typically leads to metabolic acidosis. This understanding is supported by evidence linking adrenal hormone deficiencies to specific kidney functions and blood electrolyte levels.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "### Core Medical Principle:\nAdrenal insufficiency involves a deficiency in the production of adrenal hormones, primarily cortisol and aldosterone. This condition impacts various body systems, notably the electrolyte balance and glucose metabolism.\n\n### Analysis:\n- **Hyponatremia (opa)**: Adrenal insufficiency leads to a decrease in aldosterone, which helps regulate sodium and water balance. Reduced aldosterone levels result in decreased sodium reabsorption, leading to hyponatremia.\n- **Hyperkalemia (opb)**: Similarly, the reduction in aldosterone causes less potassium to be excreted by the kidneys, resulting in hyperkalemia.\n- **Hypoglycemia (opc)**: Cortisol, another hormone produced by the adrenal glands, is crucial for glucose metabolism. A deficiency in cortisol can impair gluconeogenesis and lead to hypoglycemia.\n- **Metabolic alkalosis (opd)**: Adrenal insufficiency typically leads to metabolic acidosis, not alkalosis, due to the accumulation of acids in the body when aldosterone is deficient. Aldosterone normally helps in the excretion of hydrogen ions; its deficiency leads to less excretion and thus more acid retention.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBased on the standard medical understanding of adrenal insufficiency and its effects on electrolyte and acid-base balance, metabolic alkalosis is not associated with adrenal insufficiency. Instead, metabolic acidosis is more commonly observed. The enhanced information provided aligns with this understanding, confirming that adrenal insufficiency leads to metabolic acidosis rather than alkalosis.\n\n### Final Output:\n```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Adrenal insufficiency is characterized by deficiencies in aldosterone and cortisol, leading to hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, and hypoglycemia. It typically results in metabolic acidosis, not metabolic alkalosis, due to the reduced excretion of hydrogen ions. This understanding is consistent with standard medical knowledge and supported by the enhanced information provided.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
