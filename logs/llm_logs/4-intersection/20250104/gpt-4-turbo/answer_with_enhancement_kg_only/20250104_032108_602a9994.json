Atrial flutter\nopb. Parkinsonian tremor\nopc. Thyrotoxicosis\nopd. HOCM\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nPropranolol is beneficial in atrial flutter and thyrotoxicosis due to its beta-blocking effects on heart rate and symptoms. However, it is not the primary treatment for Parkinsonian tremor, where central nervous system changes are predominant, and is contraindicated in HOCM, where it may worsen blood flow obstruction.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "### Core Medical Principle Analysis:\nPropranolol is a non-selective beta-blocker widely used in various cardiovascular conditions due to its ability to block beta-adrenergic receptors in the heart and other parts of the body. This action results in decreased heart rate, myocardial contractility, and conduction velocity, which can be beneficial in certain medical conditions.\n\n### Evaluation of Options:\n- **Atrial Flutter (opa)**: Propranolol is effective in managing atrial flutter primarily by controlling the ventricular rate. It is commonly used in this condition to slow down the heart rate.\n  \n- **Parkinsonian Tremor (opb)**: While propranolol is used to treat essential tremor, its effectiveness in Parkinsonian tremor is less established. Parkinsonian tremor primarily involves central nervous system pathology, and the primary treatments are dopaminergic drugs rather than beta-blockers.\n\n- **Thyrotoxicosis (opc)**: Propranolol is beneficial in thyrotoxicosis for symptomatic control of hyperthyroid symptoms such as tachycardia and anxiety. It also inhibits the peripheral conversion of T4 to T3.\n\n- **Hypertrophic Obstructive Cardiomyopathy (HOCM) (opd)**: In HOCM, the use of beta-blockers like propranolol is a standard treatment to reduce heart rate and improve ventricular filling by prolonging diastole. This helps in reducing the dynamic left ventricular outflow tract obstruction.\n\n### Final Analysis:\nThe enhanced information suggests that propranolol is contraindicated in HOCM due to potential worsening of blood flow obstruction. However, this contradicts standard medical consensus where beta-blockers, including propranolol, are actually indicated in HOCM to alleviate symptoms by reducing the heart rate and thus the degree of obstruction. The use of propranolol in Parkinsonian tremor, while not the primary treatment, is not entirely unsupported but is less effective compared to its use in other listed conditions.\n\nGiven the above analysis, the most likely correct answer, based on the effectiveness and primary indication of propranolol, is that it is least useful in Parkinsonian tremor compared to the other options where it has a more direct and beneficial effect.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Propranolol is a beta-blocker with multiple uses in cardiovascular and endocrine disorders. It is effective in atrial flutter and thyrotoxicosis and is a standard treatment in HOCM. Its use in Parkinsonian tremor is less effective and not the primary treatment, making it the least useful option among the given choices.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
