Spectrin\nopb. Ankyrin\nopc. Tubulin\nopd. Laminin\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nAnkyrin is the correct answer as it directly binds the integral proteins of the plasma membrane to spectrin, which then connects to the cytoskeleton. This role is supported by evidence paths showing interactions between ankyrin and spectrin, confirming ankyrin's crucial function in linking the plasma membrane to the cytoskeleton.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The plasma membrane of a cell is intricately linked to the cytoskeleton, which provides structural support and facilitates various cellular functions. Among the options provided, Ankyrin and Spectrin are both involved in this linkage. Spectrin forms a network that lines the intracellular side of the plasma membrane and is connected to the membrane via interactions with integral proteins. Ankyrin plays a crucial role by binding these integral proteins directly to Spectrin, effectively anchoring the plasma membrane to the cytoskeleton. While Tubulin and Laminin are important in other structural contexts (Tubulin in microtubules and Laminin in the extracellular matrix), they do not directly bind the plasma membrane to the cytoskeleton in the context described. Therefore, based on the standard medical knowledge and the enhanced information provided, Ankyrin is the most accurate answer as it directly facilitates the binding of the plasma membrane to the cytoskeleton through its interaction with Spectrin.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
