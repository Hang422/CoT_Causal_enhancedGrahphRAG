This hormone is:\n\n                    ### Options\n                    opa. Endothelial growth factor (EGF)\nopb. Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG)\nopc. Human chorionic somatotropin (HCS)\nopd. Relaxin\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nHuman chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) is the hormone secreted by the placenta that is utilized in the early detection of pregnancy. This is confirmed by its presence in urine, which is the basis for most home pregnancy tests. The reasoning chains and evidence paths strongly support hCG's role in pregnancy detection, aligning with medical consensus. Other hormones such as Endothelial Growth Factor (EGF), Human Chorionic Somatotropin (HCS), and Relaxin, although produced by the placenta, do not play a role in the early detection of pregnancy. EGF is involved in cell growth and not specific to pregnancy, HCS influences metabolism during pregnancy but is not used in pregnancy tests, and Relaxin is involved in labor rather than pregnancy detection.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The core medical principle in question is the identification of the hormone secreted by the placenta that is used in the early detection of pregnancy. Among the options provided, Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) is well-recognized and widely accepted in medical literature and practice as the hormone tested for in most home pregnancy tests. This hormone is specifically secreted by the placenta shortly after implantation and its presence in urine is a reliable indicator of pregnancy, which is why it is utilized in pregnancy tests. The other hormones listed, such as Endothelial Growth Factor (EGF), Human Chorionic Somatotropin (HCS), and Relaxin, have roles in pregnancy and reproductive physiology but are not used for the early detection of pregnancy. Therefore, based on medical consensus and the enhanced information provided, hCG is the correct answer.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 98\n}",
