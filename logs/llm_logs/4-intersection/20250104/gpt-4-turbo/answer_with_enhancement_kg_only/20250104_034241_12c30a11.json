Krabbe's disease\nopb. Fabry's disease\nopc. Fragile syndrome\nopd. All\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nKrabbe's disease and Fabry's disease are lysosomal storage disorders, not glycogen storage diseases. Fragile X syndrome is a genetic disorder affecting the X chromosome and is not related to glycogen storage. The correct answer to the question is 'All,' as none of the listed diseases are glycogen storage diseases. Evidence paths confirm the metabolic or genetic nature of these diseases but do not classify them as glycogen storage diseases.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Glycogen storage diseases are a group of disorders that involve the storage and mobilization of glycogen. Krabbe's disease and Fabry's disease are classified as lysosomal storage disorders, which involve a different biochemical pathway primarily related to the breakdown of substances within the lysosomes, rather than issues with glycogen storage. Fragile X syndrome is a genetic disorder linked to the X chromosome that primarily affects intellectual development and does not involve glycogen storage mechanisms. Based on this understanding, none of the diseases listed in the options are glycogen storage diseases. Therefore, the correct answer is 'All,' as it accurately reflects that none of the options listed are associated with glycogen storage disorders.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
