Heparin sulfate\nopb. Protamine sulfate\nopc. Low molecular weight heparin\nopd. Warfarin\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nLow Molecular Weight Heparin is the recommended anticoagulant for prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism in patients undergoing cancer surgery, supported by its proven efficacy, safety, and guideline endorsements. Other options like heparin sulfate, warfarin, and protamine sulfate are less effective or inappropriate due to various pharmacological drawbacks and clinical considerations.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The primary consideration in choosing an anticoagulant for prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in patients undergoing cancer surgery is the effectiveness and safety of the drug in this specific context. Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) is widely recommended in clinical guidelines for this purpose. It has been shown to be effective in reducing the risk of VTE in cancer patients, who are at a higher risk due to both their disease and surgery. LMWH is preferred over unfractionated heparin (heparin sulfate) due to its more predictable pharmacokinetic profile and lower risk of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. Warfarin, while effective as a long-term anticoagulant, is less suitable for immediate postoperative VTE prophylaxis due to its need for careful monitoring and dose adjustment. Protamine sulfate is not an anticoagulant but a heparin antagonist, used to reverse the effects of heparin and is therefore not suitable for prophylaxis. Based on these considerations, the most appropriate choice for VTE prophylaxis in patients undergoing cancer surgery is low molecular weight heparin.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opc\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
