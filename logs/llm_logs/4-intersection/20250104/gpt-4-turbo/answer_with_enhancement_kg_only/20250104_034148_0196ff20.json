Ototoxicity\nopb. Nephrotoxicity\nopc. Coasting effect\nopd. Pulmonary fibrosis\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nCisplatin is known to cause ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity by damaging inner ear hair cells and accumulating in renal tubular cells, respectively. It also has a coasting effect where neurotoxic effects continue post-treatment. However, pulmonary fibrosis is not a recognized side effect of Cisplatin, aligning with medical consensus that does not associate Cisplatin with lung tissue damage leading to pulmonary fibrosis.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Cisplatin, a chemotherapy drug, is well-documented to cause several side effects due to its cytotoxic effects on various cells and tissues. Among the listed options, ototoxicity (damage to the ear causing hearing loss) and nephrotoxicity (damage to the kidneys) are well-established side effects of Cisplatin. These effects are due to the accumulation of the drug in the inner ear hair cells and renal tubular cells, respectively. The coasting effect, where neurotoxic effects continue even after the cessation of treatment, is also a recognized phenomenon associated with Cisplatin. However, pulmonary fibrosis, which involves scarring and damage to lung tissue, is not typically associated with Cisplatin use. This aligns with the medical consensus and available literature, which do not link Cisplatin with pulmonary fibrosis as a side effect. Therefore, the most likely correct answer, based on known medical facts and consensus, is that pulmonary fibrosis is not a side effect produced by Cisplatin.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
