Urine osmolality values are generally very low, often below 150 mmol/L, reflecting the severe impairment in the kidney's ability to concentrate urine. This aligns with medical consensus and is best represented by the option stating urine osmolality is <150 mmol/L.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Diabetes insipidus is characterized by a deficiency in the production or response to antidiuretic hormone (ADH), leading to a significant increase in urine output and a decrease in urine concentration. The condition results in the production of large volumes of dilute urine. Medical consensus supports that in cases of diabetes insipidus, urine osmolality is typically very low due to the impaired ability of the kidneys to concentrate urine. This is often reflected by urine osmolality values being less than 150 mmol/L, which is significantly lower than normal urine osmolality ranges (typically 300-900 mmol/L under normal conditions). The option stating that urine osmolality in diabetes insipidus is <150 mmol/L aligns with this understanding and is supported by both standard medical knowledge and the enhanced information provided.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
