A 62 year old man with renal artery stenosis\nopb. A 32 year old pregnant female\nopc. A 41 year old woman with hyperkalemia\nopd. A 56 year old diabetic woman\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nEnalapril, an ACE inhibitor, is generally contraindicated in certain patient groups due to specific risks. For a 62-year-old man with renal artery stenosis, enalapril is not recommended because it can worsen renal function by reducing renal perfusion. In a 32-year-old pregnant female, enalapril is contraindicated due to its potential teratogenic effects on the fetus, aligning with the evidence path indicating enalapril's association with teratogenesis. For a 41-year-old woman with hyperkalemia, enalapril use is risky as it can further elevate potassium levels, which is dangerous; this is supported by the evidence path linking hyperkalemia with enalapril. However, for a 56-year-old diabetic woman, enalapril is beneficial as it has a protective effect on kidneys in cases of diabetic nephropathy, which is confirmed by the evidence path associating enalapril with the treatment of diabetic nephropathy. Therefore, enalapril is best recommended for the 56-year-old diabetic woman to control high blood pressure while providing renal protection.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Enalapril, an ACE inhibitor, is commonly used in the management of hypertension and has specific benefits in diabetic patients by providing renal protection. For the 62-year-old man with renal artery stenosis, enalapril is not suitable as it can worsen renal function by reducing renal perfusion. In the case of the 32-year-old pregnant female, enalapril is contraindicated due to potential teratogenic effects on the fetus. For the 41-year-old woman with hyperkalemia, enalapril could exacerbate the condition by further increasing potassium levels, which is hazardous. However, for the 56-year-old diabetic woman, enalapril not only helps in controlling high blood pressure but also offers renal protection, which is particularly beneficial in diabetic nephropathy. This aligns with standard medical guidelines that recommend ACE inhibitors like enalapril for diabetic patients to manage hypertension and protect kidney function.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
