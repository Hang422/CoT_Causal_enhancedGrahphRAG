Fatty acids\nopb. Ketone bodies\nopc. Glucose\nopd. Any of the above\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nUnder normal conditions, the primary source of energy for cardiac muscle is fatty acids, which are metabolized more predominantly than other substrates. While cardiac muscle can also utilize glucose and ketone bodies, these are not the primary sources. Glucose is indeed used by cardiac muscle, but it is secondary to fatty acids. Ketone bodies are typically utilized under conditions of fasting or low carbohydrate intake, making them a less likely primary source under normal conditions. The evidence path indicating the interaction of glucose with myocardial cells supports its utilization but does not contradict the consensus that fatty acids are the primary energy source under normal conditions. Therefore, the most accurate answer is that fatty acids are the main source of energy for cardiac muscle at normal conditions.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The primary source of energy for cardiac muscle under normal conditions is fatty acids. This is supported by standard medical knowledge which indicates that the heart predominantly metabolizes fatty acids for energy. While cardiac muscle can also utilize glucose and ketone bodies, these sources are secondary and conditional, respectively. Glucose is used, but less so than fatty acids, and ketone bodies are typically used in conditions like fasting or carbohydrate restriction, not under normal dietary conditions. Therefore, the consensus and evidence strongly support fatty acids as the main energy source for cardiac muscle in normal conditions.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
