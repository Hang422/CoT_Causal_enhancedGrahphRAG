Outer hair cells in basal area\nopb. Inner hair cells in basal area\nopc. Outer hair cells in apical area\nopd. Inner hair cells in apical area\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nAminoglycosides primarily damage the outer hair cells in the basal area of the cochlea, leading to ototoxic effects. This damage is more pronounced in the basal turn, which is crucial for high-frequency sound processing. The involvement of outer hair cells in the cochlear structure and their interaction with cellular markers like SOX2 and HES1 supports this understanding, although these paths do not provide additional specifics on the mechanism of aminoglycoside-induced damage.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Aminoglycosides are a class of antibiotics known for their potential ototoxic effects, particularly affecting the hearing function. The ototoxicity primarily manifests through damage to the hair cells in the cochlea of the inner ear. The enhanced information provided aligns with the well-documented medical consensus that aminoglycosides predominantly damage the outer hair cells. This damage is more significant in the basal area of the cochlea, which is responsible for processing high-frequency sounds. The specificity of the damage to the outer hair cells in the basal turn is consistent with the typical presentation of aminoglycoside-induced hearing loss, which often begins with the loss of high-frequency hearing. Therefore, the most supported option based on both the standard medical knowledge and the enhanced information is that aminoglycosides affect the outer hair cells in the basal area.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
