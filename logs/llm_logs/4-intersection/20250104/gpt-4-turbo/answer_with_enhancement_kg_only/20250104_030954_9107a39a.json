Morphine patch\nopb. Diazepam\nopc. Clobazam\nopd. Haloperidol\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nMorphine, through its action as an opioid analgesic, effectively reduces respiratory drive and the sensation of breathlessness, directly palliating dyspnoea in patients with CA lung. This aligns with medical consensus and is supported by extensive clinical practice, unlike the other options which primarily address anxiety without significantly impacting the physiological aspects of dyspnoea.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"In addressing the palliation of dyspnoea in a patient with CA lung, the primary medical principle involves the management of symptoms to improve quality of life. Among the options provided, Morphine is well-recognized for its efficacy in palliating dyspnoea, particularly in end-stage diseases like cancer. Morphine acts by reducing the respiratory drive and the sensation of breathlessness, which is a direct approach to alleviating dyspnoea. The other options, such as Diazepam, Clobazam, and Haloperidol, primarily serve to manage anxiety or psychotic symptoms and do not directly reduce the sensation of dyspnoea. Therefore, based on medical consensus and the enhanced information provided, Morphine is the most appropriate choice for directly addressing dyspnoea in this scenario. This aligns with established clinical practices and guidelines in palliative care.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
