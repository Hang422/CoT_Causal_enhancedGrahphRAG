Androgen binding protein\nopb. Testosterone\nopc. LH\nopd. FSH\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nSertoli cells, located in the testes, support spermatogenesis by secreting androgen-binding protein, which binds to testosterone to maintain its concentration in the seminiferous tubules. Testosterone is produced by Leydig cells and its production is stimulated by LH from the pituitary gland. FSH from the pituitary gland stimulates Sertoli cells to produce androgen-binding protein. Thus, Sertoli cells do not secrete testosterone or LH.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Sertoli cells are specialized cells within the testes that play a crucial role in spermatogenesis. One of their primary functions is to secrete androgen-binding protein (ABP). ABP binds to testosterone, which is crucial for maintaining high levels of this hormone within the seminiferous tubules, thereby facilitating the maturation of sperm cells. Testosterone itself, however, is produced by Leydig cells, not Sertoli cells. The production of testosterone is stimulated by luteinizing hormone (LH), which is secreted by the pituitary gland. Similarly, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), also from the pituitary gland, stimulates Sertoli cells to produce ABP. Therefore, the correct answer is that Sertoli cells secrete androgen-binding protein, aligning with the standard medical understanding of their function.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
