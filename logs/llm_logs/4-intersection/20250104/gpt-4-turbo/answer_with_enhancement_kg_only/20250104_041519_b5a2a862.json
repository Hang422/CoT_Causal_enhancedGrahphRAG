Duodenum\nopb. Ileum\nopc. Jejunum\nopd. Colon\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nVitamin B12, bound to intrinsic factor, is absorbed in the ileum of the small intestine. This site-specific absorption is facilitated by receptors that specifically recognize the Vitamin B12-intrinsic factor complex. Evidence paths confirm the interaction between intrinsic factor and ileal cells, supporting this consensus.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The absorption of Vitamin B12, when bound to intrinsic factor, is a well-documented physiological process that occurs in the ileum of the small intestine. This specific absorption is facilitated by receptors in the ileal cells that recognize and bind the Vitamin B12-intrinsic factor complex. The duodenum, jejunum, and colon do not have the specific receptors needed for this process, making them incorrect choices for the site of Vitamin B12 absorption. The enhanced information provided aligns with the standard medical consensus, confirming that the ileum is the correct site for this absorption process.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 98\n}",
