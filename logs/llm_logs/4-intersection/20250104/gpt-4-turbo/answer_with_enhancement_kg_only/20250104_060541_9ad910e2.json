Directly simulated by fall in PaO2\nopb. Connected with cardiac center\nopc. Inhibited during swallowing\nopd. Situated in midbrain\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nThe respiratory centre, located in the medulla oblongata and pons, is primarily responsive to CO2 levels and not directly stimulated by falls in PaO2. It is connected with the cardiac center through the autonomic nervous system and is temporarily inhibited during swallowing to prevent aspiration. The centre is not situated in the midbrain.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The respiratory centre is primarily located in the medulla oblongata and pons, not the midbrain, ruling out option opd. It primarily responds to changes in CO2 levels rather than direct stimulation by a fall in PaO2, which eliminates option opa as the best answer. The respiratory centre is indeed connected with the cardiac center through the autonomic nervous system, supporting option opb. Additionally, the respiratory centre is known to be temporarily inhibited during activities like swallowing to prevent aspiration, which supports option opc. Both options opb and opc are correct, but the connection with the cardiac center (opb) is a more fundamental and continuous aspect of the respiratory centre's function compared to the temporary inhibition during swallowing (opc). Therefore, option opb is selected as the most likely correct answer based on the broader and more consistent role in physiological regulation.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}",
