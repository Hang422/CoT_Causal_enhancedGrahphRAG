Collecting duct\nopb. Glomerulus\nopc. Proximal convoluted tubule\nopd. Loop of Henle\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nAldosterone primarily acts at the collecting duct of the kidney. It binds to mineralocorticoid receptors, which are expressed in the cells of the collecting duct, leading to increased sodium reabsorption and potassium secretion. This action helps in the regulation of blood pressure and electrolyte balance. The evidence path confirming aldosterone's interaction with mineralocorticoid receptors supports this function. Other renal structures like the glomerulus, proximal convoluted tubule, and loop of Henle do not significantly interact with aldosterone in terms of sodium and water balance, aligning with medical consensus that the primary site of aldosterone action is the collecting duct.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

It primarily acts on the collecting ducts in the kidneys. Here, aldosterone binds to mineralocorticoid receptors, which leads to increased reabsorption of sodium and secretion of potassium.
