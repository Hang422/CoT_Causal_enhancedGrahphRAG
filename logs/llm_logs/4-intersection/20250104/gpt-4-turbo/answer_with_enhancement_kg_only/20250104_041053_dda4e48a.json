Produced by alpha cells of pancreas\nopb. Two polypeptide chains are bound by disulfide linkages\nopc. Shifts potassium outside the cell\nopd. S.c insulin tl/2 is 60 mins\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nInsulin is not produced by the alpha cells of the pancreas but by the beta cells, contradicting option A. Option B is correct as insulin consists of two polypeptide chains that are indeed linked by disulfide bonds. Option C is incorrect because insulin promotes the uptake of potassium into cells, not shifting it outside. Regarding option D, the half-life of subcutaneously injected insulin is approximately 5-6 minutes, not 60 minutes, making this option incorrect. The evidence path confirming insulin as part of the pancreas supports the understanding of its production site but does not directly address the specific cell type, which is clarified by medical consensus.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Analyzing the provided options in the context of standard medical knowledge about insulin: Option A is incorrect as insulin is produced by the beta cells of the pancreas, not the alpha cells. Option B states that insulin consists of two polypeptide chains linked by disulfide bonds, which is accurate according to the structure of insulin as understood in biochemistry. Option C is incorrect because insulin actually facilitates the uptake of potassium into cells rather than shifting it outside. Option D is also incorrect as the half-life of subcutaneously injected insulin is much shorter, approximately 5-6 minutes, not 60 minutes. Therefore, the most accurate and medically supported statement is Option B, which aligns with the well-established biochemical structure of insulin.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
