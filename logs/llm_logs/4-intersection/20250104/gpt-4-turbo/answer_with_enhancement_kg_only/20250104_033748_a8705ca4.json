Contraction of gall bladder\nopb. Secretion of pancreatic juice rich in enzymes\nopc. Increases the secretion of enterokinase\nopd. All\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nCholecystokinin (CCK) is known for causing the contraction of the gallbladder and stimulating the secretion of pancreatic juice rich in enzymes. These actions are well-supported by medical consensus and the provided evidence paths. However, the role of CCK in directly increasing the secretion of enterokinase in the small intestine is not strongly supported, making options (opa) and (opb) correct, but not option (opc). Consequently, option (opd) 'All' is also incorrect.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Cholecystokinin (CCK) is a well-studied gastrointestinal hormone with specific roles in the digestive system. It is primarily known for causing the contraction of the gallbladder, which aids in the release of bile into the small intestine. Additionally, CCK stimulates the secretion of pancreatic juice that is rich in digestive enzymes, facilitating the breakdown of fats, proteins, and carbohydrates. These actions are well-documented and supported by medical consensus. However, the role of CCK in the secretion of enterokinase, an enzyme involved in protein digestion, is not clearly established or supported by strong evidence. Therefore, while options (opa) and (opb) are correct, option (opc) lacks sufficient evidence. Consequently, option (opd) which includes all the listed actions, is incorrect due to the inclusion of the unsupported action (opc). Based on this analysis, the most accurate answer, supported by medical consensus, is to select the options that are well-supported.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}",
