Methotrexate\nopb. Doxorubicin\nopc. Cisplatin\nopd. Busulfan\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nMethotrexate and Busulfan are associated with a significant risk of pulmonary fibrosis, with Busulfan showing a higher specific association. Doxorubicin and Cisplatin, though capable of causing lung damage, are less commonly linked to pulmonary fibrosis.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "### Core Medical Principle\nPulmonary fibrosis is a serious lung condition characterized by progressive scarring of lung tissue. Various medications can induce pulmonary fibrosis as a side effect, particularly certain chemotherapeutic agents and immunosuppressants.\n\n### Analysis of Options\n- **Methotrexate (opa)**: This drug is primarily used in the treatment of cancer and autoimmune diseases. It is known to cause various side effects, including lung toxicity. Pulmonary fibrosis is a recognized, though relatively less common, side effect of methotrexate.\n  \n- **Doxorubicin (opb)**: Primarily used in cancer chemotherapy, doxorubicin is more commonly associated with cardiotoxicity rather than pulmonary fibrosis. Lung toxicity is not a prominent feature of doxorubicin's side effect profile.\n  \n- **Cisplatin (opc)**: Another chemotherapeutic agent, known for causing nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity. Pulmonary fibrosis is not typically associated with cisplatin.\n  \n- **Busulfan (opd)**: Used in chemotherapy, particularly before bone marrow transplants. Busulfan is well-documented for its association with pulmonary fibrosis, more so than methotrexate. It is one of the chemotherapeutic agents most strongly linked to this condition.\n\n### Final Analysis and Decision\nGiven the options and the enhanced information provided, Busulfan (opd) is the most strongly associated with pulmonary fibrosis. While Methotrexate also poses a risk, the association and frequency of pulmonary fibrosis are more significant with Busulfan. This aligns with the medical consensus and the specific information provided about the higher specific association of Busulfan with pulmonary fibrosis.\n\n### Confidence Score\nGiven the clear association of Busulfan with pulmonary fibrosis and its recognition in medical literature, the confidence in this decision is high.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Busulfan is more strongly associated with pulmonary fibrosis compared to the other options listed. Methotrexate also has a risk but less frequently leads to pulmonary fibrosis compared to Busulfan. Doxorubicin and Cisplatin are primarily associated with other types of toxicity.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}\n```",
