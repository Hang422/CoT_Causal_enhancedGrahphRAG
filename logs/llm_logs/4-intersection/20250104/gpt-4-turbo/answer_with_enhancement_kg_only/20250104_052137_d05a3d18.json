Leydig cells\nopb. Seolie cells\nopc. Seminiferous tubules\nopd. Epididymis\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nTestosterone production in males is primarily carried out by Leydig cells, located in the interstitial space of the testes. These cells are responsible for synthesizing and secreting testosterone, crucial for the development of male reproductive tissues and secondary sexual characteristics. Other options such as Sertoli cells, seminiferous tubules, and the epididymis do not primarily produce testosterone. The evidence paths provided do not offer additional relevant information to this specific function.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The primary site of testosterone production in males is the Leydig cells, which are located in the interstitial space of the testes. These cells are specifically tasked with the synthesis and secretion of testosterone, a key hormone in the development of male reproductive tissues and secondary sexual characteristics. The other options provided, such as Sertoli cells, seminiferous tubules, and the epididymis, play different roles in the male reproductive system. Sertoli cells support and nourish developing sperm cells, seminiferous tubules are involved in sperm production, and the epididymis functions in sperm maturation and storage. None of these are primarily involved in the production of testosterone. Therefore, based on standard medical knowledge and the consensus in the field of physiology, Leydig cells are the correct answer.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
