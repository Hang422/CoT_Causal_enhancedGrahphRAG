Mouth\nopb. Stomach\nopc. Small intestine\nopd. Large intestine\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nDigestion of disaccharides primarily occurs in the small intestine, facilitated by enzymes such as lactase and sucrase. The mouth and stomach do not significantly contribute to disaccharide digestion, as salivary amylase in the mouth targets starches and is deactivated by stomach acid. The large intestine also does not play a role in disaccharide digestion, as it lacks disaccharidase enzymes. Evidence paths support these conclusions by highlighting interactions between disaccharides and enzymes within the small intestine.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The digestion of disaccharides such as sucrose, lactose, and maltose primarily occurs in the small intestine. This process is facilitated by specific enzymes including lactase, sucrase, and maltase, which are present in the lining of the small intestine. These enzymes break down disaccharides into simpler sugars like glucose and fructose, which can then be absorbed into the bloodstream. The mouth, while involved in the breakdown of some carbohydrates through salivary amylase, does not significantly contribute to the digestion of disaccharides. Similarly, the stomach's acidic environment primarily focuses on protein breakdown and does not facilitate disaccharide digestion. The large intestine also does not contribute to disaccharide digestion as it primarily absorbs water and does not possess the necessary disaccharidase enzymes. Therefore, based on standard medical knowledge and the consensus in gastrointestinal physiology, the correct answer is that disaccharide digestion occurs in the small intestine.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opc\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
