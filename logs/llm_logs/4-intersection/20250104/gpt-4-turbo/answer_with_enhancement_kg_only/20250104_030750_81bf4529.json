Patient gives history of recurrent bacterial infections. Ophthalmic examination reveals white triangular plaques on conjunctiva. This patient is suffering from deficiency of:\n\n                    ### Options\n                    opa. Vitamin D\nopb. Vitamin B\nopc. Vitamin A\nopd. Vitamin C\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nThe patient's symptoms of diminished night vision, dry eyes, and white triangular plaques on the conjunctiva, along with a history of recurrent bacterial infections, strongly suggest a deficiency of Vitamin A. Night blindness and xerophthalmia (dryness of eyes) are classic symptoms of Vitamin A deficiency. The presence of Bitot's spots, the white plaques on the conjunctiva, further confirms this diagnosis, as these are specifically associated with Vitamin A deficiency. Vitamin A is also crucial for maintaining a healthy immune system, which aligns with the patient's history of recurrent infections. The evidence paths support these associations, linking night blindness and xerophthalmia directly to Vitamin A deficiency. Other vitamins such as Vitamin D, B, and C, though important for overall health, do not typically manifest with these ocular symptoms and are therefore unlikely to be the cause in this case.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The patient's symptoms of diminished night vision and dry eyes, along with the presence of white triangular plaques on the conjunctiva (Bitot's spots), are classic indicators of Vitamin A deficiency. Vitamin A is essential for the maintenance of healthy vision, particularly in low-light conditions, and for the integrity of epithelial tissues, which include the conjunctiva of the eyes. The recurrent bacterial infections reported by the patient could also be linked to Vitamin A deficiency, as it plays a crucial role in maintaining immune function. The other vitamins listed (Vitamin D, B, and C) do not typically present with these specific ocular symptoms when deficient. Therefore, based on the symptoms described and the medical consensus on the effects of vitamin deficiencies, Vitamin A deficiency is the most likely diagnosis.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opc\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
