Amyloidosis associated with multiple myeloma has the poorest prognosis\nopb. Fine - needle biopsy of subcutaneous abdominal fat is a simple & reliable method for diagnosing secondary systemic amyloidosis\nopc. Hepatic amyloid disease produces hepatomegaly but rarely jaundice\nopd. Amyloidosis of the spleen is associated with severe anemia\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nAmyloidosis associated with multiple myeloma typically has a poor prognosis. Fine-needle biopsy of subcutaneous abdominal fat is a reliable method for diagnosing systemic amyloidosis. Hepatic amyloid disease leads to hepatomegaly but rarely causes jaundice. However, amyloidosis of the spleen does not typically cause severe anemia, which usually results from other complications in amyloidosis.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "### Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\n1. **Analyzing Option opa: Amyloidosis associated with multiple myeloma has the poorest prognosis**\n   - Amyloidosis associated with multiple myeloma is known to have a poor prognosis due to the aggressive nature of multiple myeloma itself and the systemic impact of amyloid deposits. This aligns with standard medical knowledge.\n\n2. **Analyzing Option opb: Fine-needle biopsy of subcutaneous abdominal fat is a simple & reliable method for diagnosing secondary systemic amyloidosis**\n   - Fine-needle aspiration of subcutaneous abdominal fat is indeed a commonly used, minimally invasive technique for diagnosing systemic amyloidosis. It has a good diagnostic yield for amyloid proteins, making it both simple and reliable.\n\n3. **Analyzing Option opc: Hepatic amyloid disease produces hepatomegaly but rarely jaundice**\n   - Amyloid deposits in the liver can lead to an increase in liver size (hepatomegaly) but typically do not impair the liver's ability to conjugate bilirubin unless very advanced, hence jaundice is rare. This statement is consistent with medical consensus.\n\n4. **Analyzing Option opd: Amyloidosis of the spleen is associated with severe anemia**\n   - Amyloidosis involving the spleen can lead to splenomegaly, but it does not typically cause severe anemia directly. Severe anemia in amyloidosis is more likely related to other factors such as renal involvement or chronic disease impact on erythropoiesis.\n\n### Final Analysis\nBased on the analysis of each option against standard medical knowledge:\n- Options opa, opb, and opc are true and align well with established medical facts.\n- Option opd, stating that amyloidosis of the spleen is associated with severe anemia, does not align with typical presentations and outcomes of splenic amyloidosis. Severe anemia is not a direct common consequence of amyloid deposition in the spleen.\n\nGiven this analysis, the most likely incorrect statement (and thus the answer to the question of which statement is \"not true concerning amyloidosis\") is option opd.\n\n### Confidence Score\nThe confidence in this conclusion is high based on the alignment with well-documented medical knowledge and the clear differentiation of the spleen's role in amyloidosis relative to the other options provided.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"After evaluating each option against established medical knowledge, it is clear that options opa, opb, and opc align well with known facts about amyloidosis. However, option opd incorrectly associates severe anemia directly with amyloidosis of the spleen, which is not supported by typical medical presentations. Therefore, opd is identified as the incorrect statement.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
