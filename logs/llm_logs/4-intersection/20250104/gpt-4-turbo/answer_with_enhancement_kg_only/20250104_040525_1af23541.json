Carbamazepine\nopb. Vigabatrin\nopc. Sodium valproate\nopd. Lamotrigine\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nCarbamazepine, Sodium Valproate, and Lamotrigine are all indicated for the treatment of bipolar disorder as they act as mood stabilizers. Vigabatrin, however, is primarily used for epilepsy and does not have indications for bipolar disorder, supported by its direct link to epilepsy treatment in the evidence path.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"In addressing the question of which drug is not indicated for the treatment of bipolar disorder, we start by evaluating each option against established medical use. Carbamazepine, Sodium Valproate, and Lamotrigine are well-documented in medical literature as mood stabilizers used in the management of bipolar disorder. These drugs are commonly prescribed to stabilize mood swings in bipolar patients. On the other hand, Vigabatrin is primarily used in the treatment of epilepsy and is not typically used nor indicated for bipolar disorder. This aligns with the enhanced information provided, which confirms that Vigabatrin's primary indication is for epilepsy, not bipolar disorder. Therefore, based on the consensus in medical guidelines and literature, Vigabatrin is the correct answer as it is not indicated for the treatment of bipolar disorder.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
