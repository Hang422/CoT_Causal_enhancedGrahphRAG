Mannitol\nopb. Spironolactone\nopc. Furosemide\nopd. Hydrochlorothiazide\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nMannitol, an osmotic diuretic, increases intravascular volume which can exacerbate cardiac workload, making it contraindicated in patients with cardiac failure. This aligns with the standard medical consensus that osmotic diuretics like Mannitol can worsen conditions in heart failure due to the increase in intravascular volume. Spironolactone and Furosemide, on the other hand, are not contraindicated in cardiac failure; Spironolactone is a potassium-sparing diuretic that helps manage fluid overload by reducing the effects of aldosterone, beneficial in heart failure management. Furosemide, a loop diuretic, effectively reduces blood volume and decreases cardiac workload, commonly used in the management of cardiac failure. Hydrochlorothiazide, a thiazide diuretic, although less potent in severe heart failure, is not typically contraindicated unless the heart failure is unstable. The evidence paths confirm the classifications of these diuretics and their mechanisms, supporting their use or contraindication in cardiac failure scenarios.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The question requires identifying which diuretic is contraindicated in the presence of cardiac failure. Mannitol, an osmotic diuretic, is known to increase intravascular volume, which can exacerbate the workload on the heart, making it unsuitable for patients with cardiac failure. This aligns with standard medical knowledge that emphasizes the risk of increased intravascular volume in heart failure patients, as it can lead to worsening of the condition. Spironolactone and Furosemide are actually beneficial in managing cardiac failure due to their mechanisms that help reduce fluid overload and decrease cardiac workload, respectively. Hydrochlorothiazide, while less potent, is not typically contraindicated in stable heart failure cases. Therefore, based on the consensus and understanding of the mechanisms of these diuretics, Mannitol is the correct answer as it is contraindicated in cardiac failure due to its potential to increase cardiac workload by raising intravascular volume.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
