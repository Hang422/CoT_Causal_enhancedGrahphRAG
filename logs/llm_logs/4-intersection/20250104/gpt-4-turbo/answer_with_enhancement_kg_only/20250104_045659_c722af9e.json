All of the following are true about heparin except-\n\n                    ### Options\n                    opa. Weakest acid found in living things\nopb. Most commercial preparations of heparin now utilize pig intestinal slimes\nopc. Act via Antithrombin activation\nopd. Produce thrombocytopenia\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nHeparin, a sulfated glycosaminoglycan, is not the weakest acid found in living things, making option A the correct answer as it is the only false statement. Heparin is commonly sourced from pig intestinal mucosa for commercial preparations, acts via antithrombin activation to inhibit clotting factors, and can produce thrombocytopenia as a side effect. These facts align with standard medical consensus and pharmacological understanding.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Heparin is a well-known anticoagulant used in various medical settings, including cardiac surgery. It functions primarily through the activation of antithrombin, which then inhibits several key factors necessary for blood clot formation, aligning with the information provided in option C. Regarding its source, heparin is indeed predominantly extracted from pig intestinal mucosa, as stated in option B, which is a standard practice in its commercial production. Option D mentions that heparin can induce thrombocytopenia, a known side effect characterized by a reduced platelet count, which is a recognized complication of heparin therapy. However, option A describes heparin as the 'weakest acid found in living things,' which is inaccurate. Heparin is a strong acid due to its multiple sulfate groups, and there are weaker acids in biological systems, such as carbonic acid. Therefore, option A is the incorrect statement among the options provided.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
