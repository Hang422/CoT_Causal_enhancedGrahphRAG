He has a history of being treated for duodenal ulcer 4 years back. Investigation reveals elevation of gastrin levels. Which of the following statement is true regarding gastrin?\n\n                    ### Options\n                    opa. Secreted by parietal cells of stomach\nopb. Secreted by alpha ceils of pancreas\nopc. Decreases bicarbonate content in pancreatic secretion\nopd. It gets stimulated by endoluminal peptides in stomach\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nGastrin is secreted by G cells in the stomach, not by parietal cells or alpha cells of the pancreas. It primarily stimulates gastric acid secretion and does not directly affect bicarbonate content in pancreatic secretion. Gastrin is stimulated by amino acids and peptides in the stomach, making option D the correct statement regarding gastrin.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Gastrin is a hormone primarily involved in the regulation of gastric acid secretion. It is secreted by G cells located in the antrum of the stomach, not by parietal cells or alpha cells of the pancreas. Gastrin secretion is stimulated by the presence of amino acids and peptides in the stomach, which are detected during the digestion of protein. This aligns with the information provided in option D, which states that gastrin gets stimulated by endoluminal peptides in the stomach. The other options are incorrect: A suggests it is secreted by parietal cells, which is false as they secrete hydrochloric acid and intrinsic factor; B incorrectly states it is secreted by alpha cells of the pancreas, which actually secrete glucagon; C is incorrect as gastrin's primary role does not involve altering bicarbonate content in pancreatic secretion. Therefore, based on standard medical knowledge and the enhanced information provided, option D is the most accurate.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
