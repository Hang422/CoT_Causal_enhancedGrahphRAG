Directly\nopb. IG1-1\nopc. Thyroxine\nopd. Intranuclear receptors\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nGrowth hormone primarily affects growth through the production of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1). GH stimulates the liver to produce IGF-1, which then promotes growth in various tissues. This mechanism is supported by evidence showing GH's interaction with liver cells, crucial for IGF-1 production. Other pathways, such as direct effects on muscle or modulation of thyroid function, play secondary roles in GH-mediated growth.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Growth hormone (GH) primarily influences growth through a well-established mechanism involving the stimulation of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) production. GH acts on the liver and other tissues to promote the secretion of IGF-1, which in turn has direct effects on various tissues to promote growth. This pathway is a central aspect of GH function, supported by extensive research and clinical evidence. While GH may have some direct effects on tissues and could influence other hormonal pathways, the predominant and most significant route for its growth-promoting effects is through IGF-1. This understanding aligns with the consensus in endocrinology and physiology, making it the most supported answer.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
