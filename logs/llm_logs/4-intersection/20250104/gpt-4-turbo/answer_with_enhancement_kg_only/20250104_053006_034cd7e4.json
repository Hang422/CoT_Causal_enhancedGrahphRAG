Proprioception\nopb. Vibratory sense\nopc. Heat sensation\nopd. Touch\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nThe dorsal columns of the spinal cord are responsible for transmitting proprioception, vibratory sense, and fine touch. Heat sensation, however, is carried by the spinothalamic tract, not the dorsal columns. This distinction is crucial in understanding sensory pathways in the spinal cord. The evidence paths provided do not directly support these specific functions and are thus not included in the final reasoning.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "### Core Medical Principle:\nThe dorsal columns of the spinal cord are primarily responsible for transmitting sensory information related to proprioception, vibratory sense, and fine touch. Different sensory modalities are transmitted via distinct pathways in the spinal cord, with the spinothalamic tract being another major pathway that carries different types of sensory information, including temperature and pain sensations.\n\n### Analysis:\n- **Proprioception (opa)**: This is the sense of the relative position of one's own parts of the body and strength of effort being employed in movement. It is well-documented that proprioception is carried by the dorsal columns.\n  \n- **Vibratory sense (opb)**: This refers to the ability to perceive vibrations on the skin, which is also transmitted through the dorsal columns.\n  \n- **Heat sensation (opc)**: This sensory modality involves the perception of temperature. Heat sensation is not transmitted via the dorsal columns but rather through the spinothalamic tract, which carries information about pain and temperature.\n  \n- **Touch (opd)**: The sense of touch, especially fine touch, is transmitted through the dorsal columns.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBased on the standard medical knowledge and the specific functions of the sensory pathways in the spinal cord, heat sensation is the sensory modality that is not carried by the dorsal columns. This aligns with the consensus in neurophysiology regarding the role of the spinothalamic tract in transmitting temperature sensations.\n\n### Final Output:\n```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The dorsal columns of the spinal cord are responsible for transmitting proprioception, vibratory sense, and fine touch. Heat sensation, however, is carried by the spinothalamic tract. This distinction is supported by standard medical knowledge and consensus in neurophysiology.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opc\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
