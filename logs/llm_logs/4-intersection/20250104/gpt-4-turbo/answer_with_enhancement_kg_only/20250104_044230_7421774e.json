You would be concerned about the use of this drug if the patient also had what comorbid condition\n\n                    ### Options\n                    opa. Glaucoma\nopb. Essential tremor\nopc. Diabetes\nopd. Supraventricular tachycardia\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nThe primary concern with prescribing propranolol to a post-myocardial infarction patient is if the patient also has diabetes. Propranolol can mask the symptoms of hypoglycemia, increasing the risk of unrecognized hypoglycemic episodes, which is a significant safety concern. This is well-supported by medical consensus and evidence linking beta-blockers with altered glucose homeostasis. In contrast, while propranolol is used therapeutically for conditions like essential tremor and supraventricular tachycardia, and less significantly impacts systemic conditions like glaucoma when administered systemically.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Propranolol, a non-selective beta-blocker, is commonly used in the management of various cardiovascular conditions, including post-myocardial infarction management. However, its use in patients with diabetes is concerning due to its potential to mask the symptoms of hypoglycemia. Hypoglycemia unawareness can lead to severe and unrecognized low blood sugar episodes, which are dangerous. This concern is well-documented in medical literature and aligns with the consensus on the cautious use of beta-blockers in diabetic patients. The other conditions listed (glaucoma, essential tremor, and supraventricular tachycardia) do not present the same level of risk with propranolol. In fact, propranolol is often used therapeutically for essential tremor and supraventricular tachycardia, and its systemic effect on glaucoma is minimal. Therefore, the presence of diabetes in a patient being considered for propranolol therapy post-myocardial infarction is the most concerning comorbid condition.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opc\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
