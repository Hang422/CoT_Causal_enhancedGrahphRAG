Stagnant hypoxia\nopb. Anemic hypoxia\nopc. Hypoxic hypoxia\nopd. Histotoxic hypoxia\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nShock primarily causes hypoxic hypoxia, a condition where insufficient oxygen is available to meet the metabolic demands of tissues, due to inadequate tissue perfusion. This is supported by evidence linking shock to conditions that compromise oxygen delivery. Other types of hypoxia, such as anemic and histotoxic hypoxia, are less directly associated with the primary mechanisms of shock.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Shock is a critical condition characterized by inadequate blood flow to the tissues of the body, leading to insufficient oxygen delivery. This scenario typically results in hypoxic hypoxia, where the oxygen level is too low to meet the metabolic demands of tissues. Hypoxic hypoxia in the context of shock is primarily due to decreased tissue perfusion, which is a hallmark of shock. Other types of hypoxia, such as anemic hypoxia (reduced oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood), histotoxic hypoxia (tissues unable to use oxygen), and stagnant hypoxia (slow blood flow), although possible, are not the primary mechanisms directly associated with the onset of shock. Therefore, based on the standard medical understanding of the pathophysiology of shock, hypoxic hypoxia is the most accurate description of the type of hypoxia caused by shock.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opc\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
