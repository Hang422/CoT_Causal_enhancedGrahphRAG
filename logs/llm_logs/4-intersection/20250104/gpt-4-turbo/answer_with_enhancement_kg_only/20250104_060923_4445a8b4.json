Quinine\nopb. Chloroquine\nopc. Mefloquine\nopd. Atovaquone\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nChloroquine is known to accumulate in the retina and cause retinal toxicity, potentially leading to retinal pigmentation. This aligns with medical consensus and is supported by evidence paths linking Chloroquine to retinal cells. Quinine, Mefloquine, and Atovaquone, while effective against malaria, do not have documented associations with retinal pigmentation.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The question pertains to the association of certain antimalarial drugs with retinal pigmentation. Among the options provided, Chloroquine is well-documented in medical literature for its potential to cause retinal toxicity, which can include retinal pigmentation. This condition is often referred to as Chloroquine retinopathy. The mechanism involves the accumulation of Chloroquine in the retina, leading to damage and possible pigmentation changes. Quinine, Mefloquine, and Atovaquone, while also used to treat malaria, do not have strong associations with retinal pigmentation in the available medical literature. Therefore, based on the consensus and the evidence provided, Chloroquine is the most likely to cause retinal pigmentation among the options listed.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
