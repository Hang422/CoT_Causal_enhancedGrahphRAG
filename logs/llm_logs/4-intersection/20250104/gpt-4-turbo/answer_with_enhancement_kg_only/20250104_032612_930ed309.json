Thalamus\nopb. Corpus striatum\nopc. Tegmentum of pons\nopd. Tectum of midbrain\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nThe substantia nigra, known for dopamine production, transmits this neurotransmitter through its efferent fibers, primarily via the nigrostriatal pathway, to the corpus striatum. This connection is crucial for motor function regulation. The substantia nigra's other potential connections to brain regions like the thalamus, tegmentum of pons, and tectum of midbrain do not involve direct dopaminergic transmission, aligning with medical consensus and supported by evidence paths.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The substantia nigra is a critical structure in the brain known for its role in dopamine production. The primary pathway through which the substantia nigra sends dopamine is the nigrostriatal pathway, which targets the corpus striatum. This pathway is essential for the regulation of motor functions. The other listed regions, such as the thalamus, tegmentum of pons, and tectum of midbrain, do not receive direct dopaminergic fibers from the substantia nigra, according to standard medical knowledge. Therefore, based on the consensus and the enhanced information provided, the most likely correct answer is that the efferent fibers of the substantia nigra transmit dopamine to the corpus striatum.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
