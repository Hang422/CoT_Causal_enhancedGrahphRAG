Stroma\nopb. Corpora albicans\nopc. Corpora lutea\nopd. Mature follicles\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nProgesterone production in the ovary is primarily by the corpora lutea. This is supported by the standard physiological consensus that after ovulation, the corpus luteum forms from the remnants of the ovulated follicle. The primary function of the corpus luteum is to produce progesterone, which is crucial for maintaining the early stages of pregnancy until the placenta takes over. This is confirmed by the evidence path linking the structure of the corpus luteum directly to progesterone production. Other structures such as the mature follicles, corpora albicans, and stroma play significantly lesser roles in progesterone production. Mature follicles mainly focus on the maturation and release of eggs rather than progesterone production. Corpora albicans, being the degenerated form of the corpus luteum, have minimal hormonal activity. The ovarian stroma, primarily a structural component, has limited endocrine function and thus contributes minimally to progesterone production.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Progesterone is a key hormone in the female reproductive system, primarily involved in preparing and maintaining the uterus for pregnancy. After ovulation, the corpus luteum forms from the remnants of the ovulated follicle. Its primary function is to produce progesterone, which is crucial for maintaining the early stages of pregnancy until the placenta is fully developed to take over this function. The other options provided do not primarily focus on progesterone production: Mature follicles are mainly involved in the maturation and release of eggs, corpora albicans are the degenerated form of the corpus luteum and thus have minimal hormonal activity, and the ovarian stroma, while supportive structurally, has limited endocrine function. Therefore, based on standard medical knowledge and physiological consensus, the corpora lutea is the correct answer as it is directly linked to the primary production of progesterone in the ovary.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opc\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
