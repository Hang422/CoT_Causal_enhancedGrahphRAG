Ascaris\nopb. Filariasis\nopc. Malaria\nopd. Oncocerciasis\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nIvermectin is effective against parasitic diseases such as Ascaris, Filariasis, and Oncocerciasis, but it is not indicated for the treatment of Malaria, as it does not target the protozoan parasites (Plasmodium species) responsible for the disease.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Ivermectin is a well-known antiparasitic medication primarily used for treating several parasitic infections. According to standard medical knowledge, Ivermectin is indicated for the treatment of diseases caused by parasitic worms such as Ascaris (intestinal roundworms), Filariasis (caused by thread-like filarial worms), and Oncocerciasis (river blindness, caused by Onchocerca volvulus). However, Ivermectin is not effective against protozoan parasites like those that cause Malaria (Plasmodium species). This aligns with the enhanced information provided, which correctly identifies that Ivermectin does not target the parasites responsible for Malaria. Therefore, the correct answer, based on medical consensus and the information provided, is that Ivermectin is not indicated for Malaria.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opc\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
