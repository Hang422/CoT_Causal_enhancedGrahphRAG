Increases liver glycogenolysis\nopb. Causes broachiolar constriction\nopc. Evokes extrasystoles in the heart\nopd. Produces restlessness and anxiety\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nEpinephrine, when administered in high doses intravenously, does not cause bronchiolar constriction but rather induces bronchiolar relaxation through the activation of beta-2 adrenergic receptors. This is contrary to the incorrect claim in the original reasoning chain for Option B. The other actions listed, including increasing liver glycogenolysis, evoking extrasystoles in the heart, and producing restlessness and anxiety, are consistent with the known pharmacological effects of epinephrine.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "### Core Medical Principle\nEpinephrine, also known as adrenaline, is a catecholamine that acts on both alpha and beta adrenergic receptors. Its effects vary depending on the dose and the specific receptors it activates. At high doses, epinephrine primarily stimulates alpha-adrenergic receptors but also has significant effects on beta-adrenergic receptors.\n\n### Analysis of Options\n- **opa. Increases liver glycogenolysis**: True. Epinephrine stimulates the beta-2 adrenergic receptors in the liver, leading to increased glycogenolysis.\n- **opb. Causes bronchiolar constriction**: False. Epinephrine, particularly through its action on beta-2 adrenergic receptors, causes relaxation of the bronchial muscles, leading to bronchodilation, not constriction.\n- **opc. Evokes extrasystoles in the heart**: True. High doses of epinephrine can lead to cardiac arrhythmias, including extrasystoles, due to its action on beta-1 adrenergic receptors in the heart.\n- **opd. Produces restlessness and anxiety**: True. Epinephrine can cross the blood-brain barrier to a limited extent and can stimulate the central nervous system, leading to symptoms like restlessness and anxiety.\n\n### Final Analysis\nBased on the standard medical knowledge and the effects of epinephrine on adrenergic receptors, the statement that epinephrine causes bronchiolar constriction (opb) is incorrect. Instead, epinephrine causes bronchiolar relaxation. The other options align well with the known pharmacological actions of epinephrine when administered at high doses.\n\n### Confidence Score\nGiven the clear understanding of epinephrine's action on adrenergic receptors and the consensus in medical literature about its effects, the confidence in this analysis is high.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Epinephrine, when administered in high doses, leads to bronchiolar relaxation, not constriction, through its action on beta-2 adrenergic receptors. This is well-supported by medical consensus, making option B the correct answer as it incorrectly states that epinephrine causes bronchiolar constriction.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
