Glucocoicoids\nopb. Mineralcoicoids\nopc. Aldosterone\nopd. Androgens\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nThe zona reticularis of the adrenal cortex primarily secretes androgens, a type of steroid hormone. This is supported by the synthesis of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) in this layer, a precursor to more potent androgens. Evidence paths confirm the production location and classification of androgens, aligning with medical consensus that distinguishes the roles of different layers in the adrenal cortex.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The adrenal cortex is divided into three zones, each responsible for producing different types of hormones. The zona glomerulosa primarily produces mineralocorticoids such as aldosterone, the zona fasciculata produces glucocorticoids like cortisol, and the zona reticularis primarily secretes androgens, including dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA). This classification is well-supported by medical literature and aligns with the enhanced information provided, which specifically mentions the secretion of androgens by the zona reticularis. Therefore, based on the consensus in medical knowledge, the correct answer is that the major hormone secreted by the zona reticularis of the adrenal cortex is androgens.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
