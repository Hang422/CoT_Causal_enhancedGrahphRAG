Penicillin G\nopb. Tetracycline\nopc. Azithromycin\nopd. Doxycycline\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nPenicillin G is the drug of choice for treating Treponema pallidum, the causative agent of syphilis, as recommended by the CDC. It is effective at all stages of the disease due to its bactericidal effect, which involves disrupting bacterial cell wall synthesis. For patients allergic to penicillin, Doxycycline serves as an alternative treatment, though it is less effective than Penicillin G. Other antibiotics like Azithromycin and Tetracycline can be used in some cases but are generally less preferred due to potential resistance and side effects. The evidence path confirming Treponema pallidum as the causative agent of syphilis supports the primary choice of Penicillin G for treatment.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The primary medical principle in treating infections is to use the most effective and specific agent available that targets the causative organism. In the case of Treponema pallidum, the causative agent of syphilis, Penicillin G is widely recognized and recommended as the first-line treatment. This is supported by guidelines from reputable health organizations such as the CDC. Penicillin G acts by disrupting the bacterial cell wall synthesis, which is crucial for the bacterium's survival, thereby making it a highly effective treatment. While alternatives like Doxycycline, Azithromycin, and Tetracycline are mentioned for cases where patients may be allergic to penicillin, they are generally considered less effective and are secondary choices. The consensus clearly supports Penicillin G as the most effective treatment for Treponema pallidum, aligning with both standard medical knowledge and enhanced information provided.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
