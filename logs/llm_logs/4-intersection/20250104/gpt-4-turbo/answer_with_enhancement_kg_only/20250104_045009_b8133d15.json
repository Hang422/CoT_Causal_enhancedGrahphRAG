Striated\nopb. Large T tubules\nopc. Troponin system present\nopd. Caldesmon is impoant regulatory protein\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nCardiac muscle is striated and uses the troponin system for contraction, but unlike skeletal muscle, it has smaller T tubules. Caldesmon, important in smooth muscle, is not a regulatory protein in cardiac muscle. Thus, option D (Caldesmon is an important regulatory protein) is the correct answer as it does not describe a feature of cardiac muscle.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "### Core Medical Principle:\nCardiac muscle, like skeletal muscle, is striated and utilizes the troponin system for contraction regulation. It features specialized structures such as T tubules, although they are smaller compared to those in skeletal muscle. Regulatory proteins in cardiac muscle include troponin but not caldesmon, which is primarily involved in the regulation of smooth muscle.\n\n### Analysis:\n- **Option A (Striated)**: Cardiac muscle is indeed striated, which is a characteristic feature allowing for the alignment of sarcomeres and organized contraction.\n- **Option B (Large T tubules)**: This statement is incorrect as cardiac muscle has smaller T tubules compared to skeletal muscle. However, the presence of T tubules itself is a feature of cardiac muscle, just not large ones.\n- **Option C (Troponin system present)**: This is accurate. The troponin system is crucial for calcium-mediated regulation of contraction in cardiac muscle.\n- **Option D (Caldesmon is an important regulatory protein)**: This is incorrect for cardiac muscle. Caldesmon plays a role in smooth muscle regulation, not in cardiac muscle.\n\n### Final Analysis:\nThe question asks for the feature that is *not* characteristic of cardiac muscle. While option B might seem misleading by stating \"large\" T tubules, T tubules are still a feature of cardiac muscle, albeit smaller than those in skeletal muscle. Therefore, the most accurate answer that does not describe a feature of cardiac muscle is option D, where caldesmon is incorrectly noted as an important regulatory protein in cardiac muscle.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"After evaluating each option against the established characteristics of cardiac muscle, it is clear that while option B contains a slight inaccuracy regarding the size of T tubules, it still pertains to a feature of cardiac muscle. Option D, stating that caldesmon is an important regulatory protein in cardiac muscle, is entirely incorrect as caldesmon is associated with smooth muscle, not cardiac muscle. This makes option D the best answer.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
