Imipramine\nopb. Fluvoxamine\nopc. Phenelzine\nopd. Bupropion\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nImipramine, a tricyclic antidepressant, is known for its anticholinergic effects which can increase bladder capacity and reduce bedwetting, making it effective for treating nocturnal enuresis. This aligns with medical consensus and is supported by its classification and interaction within the group of tricyclic antidepressants. Other options such as Fluvoxamine (an SSRI), Phenelzine (an MAOI), and Bupropion (an NDRI) lack significant anticholinergic effects and are not effective for nocturnal enuresis, consistent with their pharmacological profiles.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The question pertains to identifying an antidepressant drug that can also be used to treat nocturnal enuresis (bedwetting). Among the options provided, Imipramine stands out as it is a tricyclic antidepressant known for its anticholinergic effects. These effects are beneficial in treating nocturnal enuresis as they can increase bladder capacity and decrease the frequency of bedwetting. This aligns with the pharmacological action of tricyclic antidepressants and is supported by medical consensus. The other drugs listed, such as Fluvoxamine (an SSRI), Phenelzine (an MAOI), and Bupropion (an NDRI), do not possess significant anticholinergic effects and are not typically used for treating nocturnal enuresis. Therefore, based on the pharmacological properties and clinical usage, Imipramine is the correct answer.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
