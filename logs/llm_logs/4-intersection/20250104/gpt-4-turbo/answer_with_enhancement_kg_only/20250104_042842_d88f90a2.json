Alpha IEN\nopb. Beta IFN\nopc. Gamma IFN\nopd. Natalizumab\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nBeta IFN is the primary first-line treatment for relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis, effectively reducing relapse frequency by modulating the immune response. Natalizumab serves as a second-line therapy, particularly useful in patients with inadequate response to first-line treatments, by blocking immune cell migration to the CNS. Alpha IFN and Gamma IFN are less suitable for RRMS, with Alpha IFN being less effective in reducing relapses and Gamma IFN potentially exacerbating the disease.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The primary treatment for relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) is based on reducing the frequency of relapses and managing symptoms effectively. Beta interferon (Beta IFN) is widely recognized and recommended as a first-line treatment for RRMS. It works by modulating the immune response, which is crucial in a disease characterized by an abnormal immune attack on the central nervous system. Clinical guidelines and studies support the use of Beta IFN due to its efficacy in reducing the frequency of relapses. Natalizumab is indeed a potent option but is generally reserved for cases where first-line treatments have failed or are contraindicated due to its higher risk profile, including the risk of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). Alpha IFN and Gamma IFN are not typically recommended for RRMS; particularly, Gamma IFN may exacerbate the disease. Therefore, based on the consensus and standard medical guidelines, Beta IFN is the most appropriate choice for the initial management of RRMS.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
