Salbutamol\nopb. Ketotifen\nopc. Fluticasone\nopd. Monteleukast\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nSalbutamol is the correct beta adrenergic agonist used as an aerosol for the treatment of bronchial asthma, aligning with pharmacological consensus and supported by evidence paths. Other options such as Ketotifen, Fluticasone, and Montelukast, while involved in asthma treatment, do not meet the criteria of beta adrenergic agonists or aerosol administration for this specific use.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The question requires identifying which of the listed drugs is a beta adrenergic agonist used as an aerosol for the treatment of bronchial asthma. Salbutamol, known also as albuterol in some regions, is a well-established beta-2 adrenergic agonist that acts by relaxing bronchial smooth muscle to provide relief from bronchoconstriction, making it a primary treatment for acute asthma symptoms and for ongoing management. It is commonly administered via inhalation, which makes it suitable as an aerosol treatment. The other options provided, namely Ketotifen, Fluticasone, and Montelukast, serve different roles in asthma management. Ketotifen is an antihistamine used mainly for prophylactic treatment of asthma, not as a beta agonist. Fluticasone is a corticosteroid used to reduce inflammation and also not a beta agonist. Montelukast is a leukotriene receptor antagonist, used to decrease inflammation and bronchoconstriction but again, not a beta agonist. Based on these distinctions and the alignment with pharmacological consensus, Salbutamol is the correct answer.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
