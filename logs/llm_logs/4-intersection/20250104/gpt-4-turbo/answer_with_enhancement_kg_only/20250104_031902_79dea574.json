Which of the following enzymes is defective?\n\n                    ### Options\n                    opa. Fructokinase\nopb. Aldolase A\nopc. Aldolase B\nopd. Sucrase\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nThe symptoms of vomiting, lethargy, and severe jaundice in the baby following fruit juice ingestion are indicative of a metabolic issue related to fructose metabolism. Aldolase B deficiency is the most likely cause, as it plays a critical role in the breakdown of fructose-1-phosphate into dihydroxyacetone phosphate and glyceraldehyde. Deficiency in Aldolase B leads to the accumulation of toxic metabolites, causing severe symptoms including jaundice. This conclusion is supported by standard biochemical pathways and the clinical presentation of hereditary fructose intolerance.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The symptoms described in the scenario - vomiting, lethargy, and severe jaundice following the ingestion of fruit juice - suggest a metabolic disorder involving fructose metabolism. Among the options provided, Aldolase B (opc) is the enzyme involved in the breakdown of fructose-1-phosphate into dihydroxyacetone phosphate and glyceraldehyde. A deficiency in Aldolase B leads to the accumulation of fructose-1-phosphate, which is toxic and can cause liver damage, hypoglycemia, and the symptoms observed. This condition is known as Hereditary Fructose Intolerance (HFI). The other options, such as Fructokinase, Aldolase A, and Sucrase, do not lead to the severe symptoms observed in this scenario when deficient. Fructokinase deficiency typically results in a benign condition called Essential Fructosuria, and deficiencies in Aldolase A and Sucrase do not align with the symptoms described. Therefore, based on the symptoms and the known biochemical pathways involved in fructose metabolism, Aldolase B deficiency is the most likely cause of the symptoms in this baby.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opc\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
