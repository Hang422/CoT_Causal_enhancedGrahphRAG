Methimazole\nopb. Propylthiouraril\nopc. Carbimazole\nopd. Perchlorate\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nPropylthiouracil (PTU) is the preferred drug for managing hyperthyroidism during the first trimester of pregnancy due to its lower teratogenic risks compared to Methimazole and Carbimazole. Methimazole and Carbimazole are not recommended during this period due to higher risks. Perchlorate, being less effective and less studied, is not a first-line treatment. The choice of PTU is supported by its established use in treating hyperthyroidism and its safety profile for the developing fetus.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The management of hyperthyroidism during pregnancy, particularly in the first trimester, requires careful consideration of the safety profiles of available medications. Propylthiouracil (PTU) is generally preferred during the first trimester due to its lower risk of causing birth defects compared to Methimazole and Carbimazole. Methimazole and Carbimazole are associated with a higher risk of teratogenic effects, making them less suitable during this critical period of fetal development. Perchlorate is not commonly used as a first-line treatment due to its lower efficacy and limited data on safety in pregnancy. Therefore, based on the consensus in medical guidelines and the safety profile of the drugs, Propylthiouracil is the most appropriate choice for managing hyperthyroidism in the first trimester of pregnancy.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
