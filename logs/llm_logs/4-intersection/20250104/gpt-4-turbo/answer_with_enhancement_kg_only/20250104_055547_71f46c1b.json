Vitamin B9\nopb. Vitamin B12\nopc. Vitamin B6\nopd. Vitamin B3\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nIsoniazid, a medication used primarily for the treatment of tuberculosis, is known to interfere with the metabolism of vitamin B6 (pyridoxine). This interference occurs because isoniazid inhibits the enzyme pyridoxine kinase, which is crucial for the activation of vitamin B6. As a result, patients on isoniazid are more likely to develop a vitamin B6 deficiency. This deficiency can lead to impaired neurotransmitter synthesis, potentially causing neurological symptoms. The evidence paths confirm the association between isoniazid and disruptions in pyridoxine metabolism, as well as the clinical use of pyridoxine to treat vitamin B6 deficiency. There is no direct evidence linking isoniazid use to significant alterations in the metabolism of vitamins B12, B9, or B3, and the reasoning chains for these vitamins do not contradict this consensus.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Isoniazid is a medication primarily used for treating tuberculosis. A well-documented side effect of isoniazid is its interference with the metabolism of vitamin B6 (pyridoxine). This occurs because isoniazid inhibits the enzyme pyridoxine kinase, which is essential for the activation of vitamin B6. Consequently, patients on isoniazid are at an increased risk of developing a vitamin B6 deficiency. This deficiency can lead to neurological symptoms due to impaired neurotransmitter synthesis. The medical consensus and available evidence strongly support the link between isoniazid use and vitamin B6 deficiency. There is no substantial evidence suggesting that isoniazid significantly affects the metabolism of other B vitamins listed in the options, such as B9, B12, or B3. Therefore, based on the consensus and the specific mechanism by which isoniazid affects vitamin B6 metabolism, the most likely vitamin deficiency seen in patients on isoniazid is vitamin B6.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opc\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
