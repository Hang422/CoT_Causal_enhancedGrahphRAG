Monotherapy for acute episodes\nopb. Monitoring of serum concentration is not useful for guiding dose adjustment\nopc. Can result in leucocytosis\nopd. Can result in hypehyroidism on long term use\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nLithium is used in bipolar disorder treatment, often requiring adjunctive therapies for acute episodes. Monitoring serum concentration is crucial for dose adjustment due to its narrow therapeutic window. Lithium can cause leucocytosis, a generally benign increase in white blood cells. Long-term use predominantly leads to hypothyroidism, not hyperthyroidism.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "### Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\n1. **Option Analysis:**\n   - **opa. Monotherapy for acute episodes:** Lithium is often used in the treatment of bipolar disorder, but it is typically not sufficient as monotherapy for acute manic episodes. It is more commonly used as a maintenance therapy to prevent mood swings.\n   - **opb. Monitoring of serum concentration is not useful for guiding dose adjustment:** This statement is incorrect. Monitoring serum lithium levels is crucial due to its narrow therapeutic index. Regular monitoring helps prevent toxicity and ensures therapeutic efficacy.\n   - **opc. Can result in leucocytosis:** Lithium has been documented to cause leucocytosis, which is an increase in white blood cell count. This effect is generally benign and does not typically require discontinuation of the drug.\n   - **opd. Can result in hyperthyroidism on long term use:** The more common thyroid-related side effect of long-term lithium use is hypothyroidism, not hyperthyroidism.\n\n2. **Most Likely Correct Option:**\n   - Based on the analysis, **opc (Can result in leucocytosis)** is the correct statement. It aligns with well-documented side effects of lithium and is supported by medical consensus.\n\n3. **Final Analysis and Confidence Score:**\n   - The decision is based on standard pharmacological knowledge about lithium's side effects and its clinical use in bipolar disorder. The information about leucocytosis as a side effect of lithium is well-supported and aligns with the consensus in medical literature and practice.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"After evaluating each statement against standard medical knowledge, opc is identified as the correct answer. Lithium is known to cause leucocytosis, a generally benign increase in white blood cells, which aligns with the consensus in medical literature. Other options were evaluated and found inconsistent with well-established medical facts.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opc\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
