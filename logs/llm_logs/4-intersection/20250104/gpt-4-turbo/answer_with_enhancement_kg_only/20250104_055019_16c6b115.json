Interleukin-6\nopb. Interleukin-6 receptor\nopc. Interleukin-5\nopd. Interleukin-5 receptor\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nTocilizumab is a monoclonal antibody used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, specifically targeting the interleukin-6 receptor (IL-6R). This action blocks the interaction of IL-6 with its receptor, thereby modulating the inflammatory response that characterizes the disease. The evidence supports tocilizumab's role and mechanism as aligned with its classification and therapeutic use in rheumatoid arthritis, focusing on its interaction with the IL-6 receptor.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Tocilizumab is a monoclonal antibody used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. The primary mechanism of action for tocilizumab involves targeting and inhibiting the interleukin-6 receptor (IL-6R). By blocking this receptor, tocilizumab prevents interleukin-6 (IL-6) from binding to its receptor, which is a crucial step in the inflammatory process that contributes to the symptoms and progression of rheumatoid arthritis. This aligns with the standard medical understanding and consensus on the drug's mechanism of action. The options provided include both interleukin-6 and its receptor; however, the specific target for tocilizumab is the interleukin-6 receptor, not the interleukin itself.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
