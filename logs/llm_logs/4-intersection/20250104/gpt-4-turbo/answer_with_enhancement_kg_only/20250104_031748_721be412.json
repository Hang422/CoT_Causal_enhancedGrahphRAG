Sparfloxacin\nopb. Tetracycline\nopc. Gentamicin\nopd. Clofazimine\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nAmong the listed drugs, Tetracycline is known to cause Pseudotumour cerebri. This is due to its effect on inhibiting the absorption of cerebrospinal fluid, which can lead to increased intracranial pressure, a characteristic of Pseudotumour cerebri. The other drugs, Sparfloxacin, Gentamicin, and Clofazimine, do not have known effects on cerebrospinal fluid dynamics or intracranial pressure. Specifically, Sparfloxacin has no known effect on cerebrospinal fluid, Gentamicin primarily affects renal function and auditory nerves without impacting cerebrospinal fluid dynamics, and Clofazimine, while used for leprosy and inflammatory conditions, has no reported cases linking it to Pseudotumour cerebri. Therefore, the correct answer is Tetracycline.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Pseudotumor cerebri, also known as idiopathic intracranial hypertension, is a condition characterized by increased intracranial pressure without an apparent cause. Among the drugs listed, Tetracycline is known to be associated with the development of Pseudotumor cerebri. This association is primarily due to Tetracycline's ability to inhibit the absorption of cerebrospinal fluid, leading to increased intracranial pressure. The other drugs mentioned, such as Sparfloxacin, Gentamicin, and Clofazimine, do not have documented effects on cerebrospinal fluid dynamics or are not commonly associated with increased intracranial pressure. Therefore, based on the consensus in medical literature and pharmacological understanding, Tetracycline is the correct answer.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
