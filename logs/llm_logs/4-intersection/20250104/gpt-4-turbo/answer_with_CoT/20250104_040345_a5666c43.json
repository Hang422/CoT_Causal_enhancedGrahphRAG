  "response": "### Core Medical Principle:\nAldosterone is a steroid hormone produced by the adrenal cortex. It plays a crucial role in regulating blood pressure and electrolyte balance by influencing sodium and water retention in the kidneys. Its primary action is mediated through the mineralocorticoid receptor.\n\n### Analysis of Options:\n- **opa. Proximal tubule**: Aldosterone has minimal direct action on the proximal tubule. The primary function here is reabsorption of about 65% of filtered sodium, but this process is largely independent of aldosterone.\n- **opb. Distal tubules**: Aldosterone acts significantly on the distal tubules. It binds to mineralocorticoid receptors in the distal tubules and increases sodium reabsorption and potassium excretion. This is a well-documented action of aldosterone.\n- **opc. Loop of Henle**: Aldosterone does not have a significant direct effect on the Loop of Henle. The Loop of Henle primarily focuses on creating a concentration gradient in the medulla, which is crucial for water reabsorption, but this process is largely independent of aldosterone.\n- **opd. Collecting duct**: Aldosterone also acts on the collecting ducts, particularly on the principal cells, where it increases sodium reabsorption and enhances water retention indirectly through the action of antidiuretic hormone (ADH). However, its primary and more direct effects are noted in the distal tubules.\n\n### Final Analysis:\nWhile aldosterone does influence both the distal tubules and the collecting duct, its primary and more direct action is in the distal tubules where it increases sodium reabsorption and potassium secretion. This is a fundamental aspect of its role in regulating electrolyte balance and blood pressure. The action on the collecting duct, though significant, is more of a secondary effect, particularly influenced by the presence of ADH for water reabsorption.\n\nGiven the evidence and the consensus in medical literature, the most accurate answer is that aldosterone primarily acts on the distal tubules.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Aldosterone primarily acts on the distal tubules by binding to mineralocorticoid receptors, increasing sodium reabsorption, and enhancing potassium excretion.
