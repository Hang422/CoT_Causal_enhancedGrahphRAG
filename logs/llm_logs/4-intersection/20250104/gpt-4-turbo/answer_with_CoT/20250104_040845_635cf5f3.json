  "response": "### Core Medical Principle:\nThe primary concern here is identifying which anti-tubercular drug is most likely to cause ototoxicity, manifesting as deafness and tinnitus. Ototoxicity refers to drug-induced damage to the ear, which can affect hearing, balance, or both.\n\n### Analysis of Options:\n1. **Streptomycin**: This is an aminoglycoside antibiotic known for its ototoxic effects, which can include both hearing loss and tinnitus. The mechanism involves damage to the sensory cells in the cochlea of the inner ear or to the auditory nerve.\n   \n2. **Isoniazid**: Primarily associated with peripheral neuropathy and less commonly with ototoxic effects. It is not typically known to cause significant auditory issues like deafness or tinnitus directly.\n\n3. **Ethambutol**: Known more for causing visual disturbances (e.g., optic neuritis) rather than auditory problems. It is very rarely linked to issues like tinnitus or deafness.\n\n4. **Rifampicin**: A broad-spectrum antibiotic used in tuberculosis treatment. It is not commonly associated with ototoxic effects and thus is unlikely to cause deafness or tinnitus.\n\n### Validation and Consensus:\n- The strongest evidence and medical consensus point towards **Streptomycin** as the drug most likely to cause ototoxic effects such as deafness and tinnitus. This aligns with the known side effects of aminoglycosides, which are well-documented to cause auditory nerve damage.\n- The other drugs listed (Isoniazid, Ethambutol, and Rifampicin) have different primary side effects and are much less likely to cause the symptoms described.\n\n### Final Analysis and Confidence Score:\nGiven the well-established link between Streptomycin and ototoxic effects, and considering the typical side effects of the other options, Streptomycin is the most likely cause of the patient's symptoms of deafness and tinnitus. The medical consensus strongly supports this conclusion.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Streptomycin, an aminoglycoside antibiotic, is well-known for its ototoxic effects, which can lead to symptoms such as deafness and tinnitus.
