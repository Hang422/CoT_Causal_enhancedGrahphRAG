  "response": "### Core Medical Principle:\nGastrin is a hormone primarily involved in the regulation of gastric acid secretion in the stomach. It is secreted by G cells located in the antrum of the stomach, pyloric region, and duodenum. Gastrin release is stimulated by the presence of food, particularly proteins and amino acids, in the stomach.\n\n### Analysis of Options:\n- **opa. Secreted by parietal cells of stomach**: This statement is incorrect. Gastrin is secreted by G cells, not parietal cells. Parietal cells secrete hydrochloric acid in response to gastrin but do not produce gastrin itself.\n  \n- **opb. Secreted by alpha cells of pancreas**: This statement is incorrect. Alpha cells of the pancreas secrete glucagon, not gastrin. Gastrin is produced in the stomach and duodenum, not the pancreas.\n  \n- **opc. Decreases bicarbonate content in pancreatic secretion**: This statement is incorrect. Gastrin primarily affects gastric acid secretion and does not directly influence the bicarbonate content in pancreatic secretion. The regulation of bicarbonate in the pancreas is more directly influenced by other hormones like secretin.\n  \n- **opd. It gets stimulated by endoluminal peptides in stomach**: This statement is correct. Gastrin secretion is stimulated by the presence of peptides and amino acids in the stomach. This is a well-established mechanism in the physiological regulation of gastrin.\n\n### Final Analysis:\nThe most accurate statement regarding gastrin, based on standard medical knowledge and physiological consensus, is that it is stimulated by endoluminal peptides in the stomach. This aligns with the known function of gastrin in response to dietary proteins, which helps in the digestive process by regulating gastric acid secretion.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Gastrin is secreted by G cells in the stomach and duodenum, not by parietal or pancreatic alpha cells. It does not directly affect pancreatic bicarbonate secretion but is stimulated by peptides and amino acids in the stomach, making option opd the correct choice.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
