  "response": "### Core Medical Principle:\nThe zona reticularis is one of the three layers of the adrenal cortex, each of which is responsible for producing different types of steroid hormones. The zona reticularis primarily secretes androgens, which are a type of sex steroid involved in the development of male secondary sexual characteristics and other functions.\n\n### Analysis of Options:\n- **opa. Glucocorticoids**: These are primarily secreted by the zona fasciculata of the adrenal cortex, not the zona reticularis.\n- **opb. Mineralocorticoids**: These are mainly produced by the zona glomerulosa.\n- **opc. Aldosterone**: This is a specific type of mineralocorticoid primarily secreted by the zona glomerulosa.\n- **opd. Androgens**: This is the correct answer as androgens are the major hormones produced by the zona reticularis. This includes hormones like dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA).\n\n### Validation Through Medical Consensus:\nThe consensus in medical literature and physiology textbooks confirms that the zona reticularis is primarily responsible for the secretion of androgens. This is supported by multiple sources and is a well-established fact in endocrinology.\n\n### Final Analysis:\nGiven the specific roles of each layer of the adrenal cortex, and the well-documented function of the zona reticularis in secreting androgens, the most accurate answer to the question is that the major hormone secreted by the zona reticularis of the adrenal cortex is androgens. This aligns with standard medical knowledge and consensus.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The zona reticularis of the adrenal cortex is known for its role in secreting androgens, such as DHEA, which are sex steroids. This is a well-established fact supported by medical consensus, distinguishing it from other layers of the adrenal cortex that secrete different types of hormones.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
