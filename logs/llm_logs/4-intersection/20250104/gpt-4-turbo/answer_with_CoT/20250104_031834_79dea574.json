  "response": "### Core Medical Principle:\nThe symptoms described in the scenario - vomiting, lethargy, and severe jaundice following the introduction of fruit juice in a baby - suggest a metabolic disorder related to the breakdown of fructose. The key enzymes involved in fructose metabolism include fructokinase, which phosphorylates fructose to fructose-1-phosphate, and aldolase B, which further breaks down fructose-1-phosphate into dihydroxyacetone phosphate and glyceraldehyde. A deficiency in aldolase B leads to the accumulation of fructose-1-phosphate, which is toxic and can cause severe liver and kidney damage.\n\n### Analysis of Options:\n- **Fructokinase (opa)**: Deficiency leads to benign fructosuria, which typically does not cause severe symptoms like jaundice or lethargy.\n- **Aldolase A (opb)**: Primarily involved in glycolysis, not specific to fructose metabolism. Deficiency would not typically result in symptoms triggered specifically by fructose ingestion.\n- **Aldolase B (opc)**: Deficiency leads to hereditary fructose intolerance. This condition causes severe symptoms upon ingestion of fructose, including liver dysfunction (jaundice), hypoglycemia (lethargy), and vomiting.\n- **Sucrase (opd)**: Involved in the breakdown of sucrose into glucose and fructose. Deficiency leads to sucrase-isomaltase deficiency, which typically presents with diarrhea and abdominal pain, not jaundice.\n\n### Final Analysis:\nGiven the symptoms and the timing with the introduction of fruit juice, the most likely diagnosis is hereditary fructose intolerance, which is caused by a deficiency in aldolase B. This enzyme's role in breaking down fructose-1-phosphate is critical, and its deficiency leads to the accumulation of this metabolite, causing toxic effects that are consistent with the symptoms described. The other enzyme deficiencies either do not align with the symptoms presented or would cause different symptoms.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The symptoms of vomiting, lethargy, and severe jaundice following the introduction of fruit juice in a 6-month-old baby suggest a metabolic disorder related to fructose metabolism, specifically hereditary fructose intolerance.
