  "response": "### Core Medical Principle:\nProgesterone is a hormone primarily involved in the menstrual cycle and pregnancy. In the ovary, progesterone production is crucial for preparing the endometrium for potential pregnancy after ovulation. The primary site of progesterone production in the ovary changes after ovulation.\n\n### Analysis of Options:\n- **opa. Stroma**: The ovarian stroma primarily provides structural support and contains cells that can produce some hormones, but it is not the primary site for progesterone production.\n- **opb. Corpora albicans**: The corpora albicans is the regressed form of the corpus luteum and does not actively produce significant hormones, including progesterone.\n- **opc. Corpora lutea**: After ovulation, the ruptured follicle transforms into the corpus luteum, which secretes high levels of progesterone to maintain the uterine lining for potential implantation of an embryo.\n- **opd. Mature follicles**: While mature follicles do produce some progesterone, their primary role is the release of the egg (ovulation); the majority of progesterone production occurs post-ovulation in the corpus luteum.\n\n### Final Analysis:\nThe corpora lutea is the transformed state of the ruptured follicle post-ovulation, specifically tasked with producing significant amounts of progesterone essential for maintaining the endometrium during the early stages of pregnancy. This aligns with standard medical knowledge where the corpus luteum's role in hormone production, particularly progesterone, is emphasized. The other options, while involved in ovarian function, do not primarily focus on progesterone production to the extent seen in the corpora lutea.\n\nGiven the clear role of the corpora lutea in progesterone production post-ovulation, and the lesser involvement or different roles of the other structures listed, the most accurate answer is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The corpora lutea is the primary site for progesterone production in the ovary, especially following ovulation. This is a well-established fact in reproductive physiology, supported by the understanding of the transformation of the ruptured follicle into the corpus luteum, which then produces significant levels of progesterone.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opc\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
