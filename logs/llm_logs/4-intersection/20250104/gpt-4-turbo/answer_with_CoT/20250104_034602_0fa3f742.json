  "response": "### Core Medical Principle:\nIsoniazid (INH), a medication used primarily for the treatment of tuberculosis, is known to cause a specific type of neuropathy due to its interference with the metabolism of pyridoxine (vitamin B6). This interference leads to a deficiency in pyridoxine, which is crucial for nerve function and health. The resulting condition is peripheral neuropathy, characterized by symptoms such as pain, burning, tingling, and numbness in the extremities.\n\n### Most Likely Correct Option Based on Consensus:\nThe standard treatment for preventing and managing INH-induced neuropathy is the supplementation of pyridoxine (vitamin B6). This approach is well-documented and widely accepted in medical practice. Pyridoxine supplementation replenishes the depleted levels of vitamin B6, thereby helping to restore normal nerve function and alleviate the symptoms of neuropathy.\n\n### Analysis of Other Options:\n- **Thiamine (Vitamin B1)**: While thiamine is important for nerve health, there is no direct link between INH-induced neuropathy and thiamine deficiency. Thus, supplementation with thiamine is not typically used for this specific type of neuropathy.\n- **Niacin (Vitamin B3)**: Similarly, niacin plays a role in general body functions and nerve health, but it is not specifically used to treat INH-induced neuropathy.\n- **Riboflavin (Vitamin B2)**: There is no evidence to suggest that riboflavin supplementation is effective in treating INH-induced neuropathy.\n\n### Final Analysis and Confidence Score:\nBased on the established medical consensus and the specific mechanism by which INH causes neuropathy (through pyridoxine depletion), the most appropriate treatment is the supplementation of pyridoxine. This approach directly addresses the underlying cause of the neuropathy associated with INH use and is supported by substantial clinical practice and literature.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"INH-induced neuropathy is primarily caused by the depletion of pyridoxine (vitamin B6), leading to nerve damage.
