  "response": "### Core Medical Principle:\nLoop diuretics are a class of diuretics that act on the ascending limb of the loop of Henle in the kidney. They inhibit the Na+.K+.2Cl- symporter, leading to increased excretion of sodium, potassium, chloride, and also affect the excretion of other ions such as calcium and magnesium.\n\n### Analysis of Options:\n1. **opa. They are called as \"high ceiling\" diuretics**\n   - True. Loop diuretics are termed \"high ceiling\" because they can cause a significant increase in urine output, which is much higher compared to other classes of diuretics.\n\n2. **opb. They act on Na+.K+.2Cl- symporter**\n   - True. The primary mechanism of action for loop diuretics is the inhibition of the Na+.K+.2Cl- symporter in the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle.\n\n3. **opc. They can cause hyperuricemia**\n   - True. Loop diuretics can lead to hyperuricemia by increasing uric acid reabsorption in the proximal tubule of the kidney.\n\n4. **opd. Loop diuretics lead to hypercalcemia and hypomagnesimia**\n   - Partly true and partly false. Loop diuretics indeed lead to hypomagnesemia by increasing magnesium excretion. However, they typically cause hypocalcemia, not hypercalcemia, by increasing calcium excretion. This part of the statement is incorrect.\n\n### Final Analysis:\nBased on the analysis, the statement in option D is partially incorrect because loop diuretics lead to hypocalcemia rather than hypercalcemia. The other parts of the statement regarding loop diuretics are accurate. Therefore, option D is the correct answer as it contains a false statement about the effect of loop diuretics on calcium levels.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Loop diuretics are known to increase the excretion of calcium, leading to hypocalcemia, not hypercalcemia, while they do cause hypomagnesemia. This makes option D partially incorrect, identifying it as the exception among the provided statements.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}\n```",
