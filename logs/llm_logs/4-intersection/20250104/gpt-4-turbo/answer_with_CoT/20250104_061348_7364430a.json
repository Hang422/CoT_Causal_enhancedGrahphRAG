Leucine\nopb. Lysine\nopc. Methionine\nopd. Proline\n\n### Reasoning Chains for Validation:\n- CHAIN: \"Leucine\" -> \"classified as an essential amino acid\" -> \"necessary for human diet\" -> 0%\n- CHAIN: \"Lysine\" -> \"classified as an essential amino acid\" -> \"necessary for human diet\" -> 0%\n- CHAIN: \"Methionine\" -> \"classified as an essential amino acid\" -> \"necessary for human diet\" -> 0%\n- CHAIN: \"Proline\" -> \"classified as a non-essential amino acid\" -> \"can be synthesized by the human body\" -> 100%\n\n### Retrieved Validation Paths:\n- (Leucine)-INTERACTS_WITH->(T-Lymphocyte)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Amino Acids)\n- (Leucine)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cells)-LOCATION_OF->(Amino Acids)\n- (Lysine)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cells)-INTERACTS_WITH/LOCATION_OF->(Amino Acids)\n\n            ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2.

  "response": "### Core Medical Principle:\nThe classification of amino acids into essential and non-essential categories is based on the body's ability to synthesize them. Essential amino acids cannot be synthesized de novo by the organism (in this case, humans) and must be obtained from the diet.\n\n### Analysis of Options:\n- **Leucine**: It is an essential amino acid, meaning it must be obtained through the diet as the human body cannot synthesize it.\n- **Lysine**: This is also an essential amino acid, required from dietary sources because the body cannot produce it on its own.\n- **Methionine**: Classified as an essential amino acid, Methionine is vital for various metabolic processes and must be ingested through food.\n- **Proline**: Unlike the other options, Proline is a non-essential amino acid. The human body can synthesize Proline, thus it does not necessarily need to be obtained from the diet.\n\n### Final Analysis:\nBased on the standard medical knowledge, Leucine, Lysine, and Methionine are all essential amino acids, which means they must be obtained from the diet as the body cannot synthesize them. Proline, however, is a non-essential amino acid, which the body can synthesize. Therefore, the correct answer to the question \"Essential amino acids are all except:\" is Proline.\n\n### Confidence Score:\nGiven the clear distinction in the synthesis capabilities of essential versus non-essential amino acids and the specific categorization of Proline as non-essential, the confidence in this answer is high.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Based on the established medical classification, Leucine, Lysine, and Methionine are essential amino acids, required from the diet. Proline, being a non-essential amino acid, can be synthesized by the human body and thus does not need to be necessarily obtained from dietary sources. Therefore, Proline is the correct answer as it is not an essential amino acid.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 100\n}\n```",
