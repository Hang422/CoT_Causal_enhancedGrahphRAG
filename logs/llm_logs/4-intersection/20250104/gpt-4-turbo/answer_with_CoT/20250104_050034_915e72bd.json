  "response": "### Core Medical Principle:\nThe stomach is known to secrete various substances that aid in digestion. These include enzymes and acids that facilitate the breakdown of food components.\n\n### Analysis of Options:\n1. **Lipase**: While the stomach does secrete a form of lipase known as gastric lipase, it is not the primary lipase responsible for fat digestion; that role is primarily taken by pancreatic lipase. However, gastric lipase does play a role in fat digestion in the stomach.\n   \n2. **Pepsinogens**: These are indeed secreted by the stomach. Pepsinogens are zymogens (inactive enzyme precursors) that are converted into the active enzyme pepsin in the presence of stomach acid (HCl). Pepsin is crucial for the breakdown of proteins in the stomach.\n\n3. **HCl (Hydrochloric Acid)**: HCl is a major component of gastric juice, secreted by the parietal cells of the stomach. It helps in creating an acidic environment, which is essential for the activation of pepsin from pepsinogen and for overall digestion.\n\n4. **None**: This option suggests that all listed substances are secreted by the stomach, which aligns with the functions of the stomach as described.\n\n### Final Analysis:\nAll the substances listed (Lipase, Pepsinogens, HCl) are indeed secreted by the stomach. Gastric lipase, although not as prominent as pancreatic lipase, is still a valid secretion of the stomach for lipid digestion. Pepsinogens and HCl are well-documented secretions of the stomach essential for protein digestion and creating an acidic environment, respectively.\n\nGiven this information, the correct answer is that none of the options listed are \"not secreted by the stomach.\" Therefore, the answer is \"None.\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"After evaluating each substance listed, it is clear that all are secreted by the stomach. Gastric lipase, though less known than pancreatic lipase, is secreted by the stomach and aids in fat digestion. Pepsinogens and HCl are fundamental to protein digestion and maintaining stomach pH. Thus, all options are secreted by the stomach.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
