  "response": "### Core Medical Principle:\nThe hormone utilized in the early detection of pregnancy is one that is secreted by the placenta and can be detected in biological fluids (such as urine) shortly after conception. The hormone should be specific to pregnancy to ensure the reliability of the test.\n\n### Analysis of Options:\n- **Endothelial Growth Factor (EGF)**: While EGF is involved in cell growth and may play roles in various physiological processes, it is not specific to pregnancy and is not used in pregnancy tests.\n- **Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG)**: hCG is a hormone produced by the placenta shortly after the embryo attaches to the uterine lining. It is specifically increased during early pregnancy and is the hormone detected by most pregnancy tests. This hormone's presence in urine or blood is a reliable indicator of pregnancy.\n- **Human Chorionic Somatotropin (HCS)**: Also known as human placental lactogen, HCS is involved in altering the metabolic state of the mother during pregnancy to facilitate the energy supply to the fetus. However, it is not used in the early detection of pregnancy through standard pregnancy tests.\n- **Relaxin**: This hormone helps prepare the uterus for pregnancy and is involved in the labor process. It is not used for early pregnancy detection.\n\n### Final Analysis:\nThe hormone that fits the description of being used in early pregnancy tests, due to its specific increase during early pregnancy and detection in biological fluids, is Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG). The other hormones, while important in various aspects of pregnancy and reproductive physiology, do not meet the criteria for early pregnancy detection used in standard pregnancy tests.\n\nGiven the specific role of hCG in the early stages of pregnancy and its widespread recognition and use in pregnancy tests, it is the correct answer. The medical consensus strongly supports this conclusion, and the reasoning chains align with known physiological facts.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG) is the hormone secreted by the placenta used in the early detection of pregnancy. It is specifically increased in early pregnancy and detectable in urine or blood, which is the basis for most pregnancy tests. The other options, while related to pregnancy, do not serve the purpose of early detection.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
