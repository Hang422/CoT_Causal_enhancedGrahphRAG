  "response": "### Core Medical Principle:\nThe question revolves around identifying which of the listed enzymes is not a typical marker of the plasma membrane in cells. Enzymatic markers of the plasma membrane are those enzymes that are predominantly located in or associated with the plasma membrane, playing roles in signal transduction, ion transport, or other membrane-specific functions.\n\n### Analysis of Options:\n1. **5'-nucleotidase**: This enzyme is known to be associated with the plasma membrane and is involved in the hydrolysis of nucleotide monophosphates. It is a well-recognized marker for the plasma membrane.\n\n2. **Adenylyl cyclase**: This enzyme converts ATP to cyclic AMP and is integral to signal transduction processes associated with the plasma membrane. It is also a recognized marker of the plasma membrane.\n\n3. **Na+-K+-ATPase**: This is a crucial enzyme for ion transport, specifically in maintaining the gradient of sodium and potassium across the plasma membrane. It is a definitive marker of the plasma membrane.\n\n4. **Galactosyl transferase**: This enzyme is primarily associated with the Golgi apparatus, where it functions in the glycosylation of proteins and lipids. While some literature suggests minor associations with other cellular locations under specific conditions, its primary and well-recognized association is with the Golgi apparatus, not the plasma membrane.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBased on the standard medical knowledge and consensus, **Galactosyl transferase** is not a typical enzymatic marker of the plasma membrane but rather of the Golgi apparatus. The other enzymes listed (5'-nucleotidase, Adenylyl cyclase, Na+-K+-ATPase) are well-documented as plasma membrane markers.\n\n### Final Output:\n```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"After evaluating each option against standard medical knowledge, it is clear that Galactosyl transferase, primarily associated with the Golgi apparatus, is not a marker of the plasma membrane. This conclusion aligns with the consensus on the typical cellular localization of these enzymes.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}\n```",
