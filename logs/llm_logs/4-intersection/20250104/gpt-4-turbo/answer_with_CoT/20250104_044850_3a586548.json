  "response": "### Core Medical Principle:\nThe digestion of disaccharides primarily occurs in the small intestine where specific enzymes, known as disaccharidases, break down disaccharides into monosaccharides which can then be absorbed by the body.\n\n### Analysis of Options:\n- **opa. Mouth**: While the mouth initiates the digestion of carbohydrates with salivary amylase, this enzyme primarily targets polysaccharides like starch, not disaccharides.\n- **opb. Stomach**: The acidic environment of the stomach deactivates salivary amylase and does not facilitate the digestion of disaccharides, as there are no enzymes in the stomach that specifically break down disaccharides.\n- **opc. Small intestine**: This is where disaccharides are predominantly digested. Enzymes such as lactase, sucrase, and maltase in the small intestine specifically act on disaccharides, converting them into monosaccharides.\n- **opd. Large intestine**: The large intestine does not play a significant role in the digestion of disaccharides. It primarily deals with the absorption of water and salts and the fermentation of undigested food by microbiota.\n\n### Final Analysis:\nThe digestion of disaccharides primarily occurs in the small intestine. This is supported by standard medical knowledge which identifies the presence of specific enzymes necessary for the breakdown of disaccharides into monosaccharides in the small intestine. The other options do not align with the physiological processes involved in disaccharide digestion as described in medical consensus.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The digestion of disaccharides occurs predominantly in the small intestine, where specific enzymes such as lactase, sucrase, and maltase break down disaccharides into monosaccharides. This is a well-established fact in physiology, supported by the presence and function of these enzymes specifically in the small intestine.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opc\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
