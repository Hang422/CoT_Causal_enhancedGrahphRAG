Ototoxicity\nopb. Nephrotoxicity\nopc. Coasting effect\nopd. Pulmonary fibrosis\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nCisplatin is known to cause Ototoxicity and Nephrotoxicity due to its effects on cochlear hair cells and renal tubular cells, respectively. It is also associated with the Coasting effect, where neurotoxic symptoms can persist after treatment. However, Pulmonary Fibrosis is not a recognized side effect of Cisplatin, as evidence linking it to lung tissue damage is broad and non-specific.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "### Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\n1. **Review of Cisplatin Side Effects**:\n   - **Ototoxicity**: Cisplatin is well-documented to cause ototoxicity, which involves damage to the inner ear, leading to hearing loss. This is a common side effect due to its toxic effects on cochlear hair cells.\n   - **Nephrotoxicity**: This is another well-known side effect of Cisplatin. It affects the kidneys, particularly the renal tubular cells, leading to renal dysfunction.\n   - **Coasting Effect**: This term refers to the phenomenon where certain side effects of chemotherapy, such as neurotoxicity, continue to worsen or persist even after the cessation of the therapy. Cisplatin is associated with this effect, particularly concerning its neurotoxic side effects.\n\n2. **Analysis of Pulmonary Fibrosis as a Side Effect**:\n   - **Pulmonary Fibrosis**: This condition involves the scarring and thickening of lung tissue, leading to severe respiratory issues. The enhanced information provided and standard medical literature do not commonly associate pulmonary fibrosis directly with Cisplatin use. While Cisplatin can have broad toxic effects, specific evidence linking it to pulmonary fibrosis is not robust or widely recognized in medical consensus.\n\n3. **Conclusion Based on Medical Consensus**:\n   - Given the well-documented evidence of ototoxicity, nephrotoxicity, and the coasting effect with Cisplatin, and the lack of strong evidence linking it to pulmonary fibrosis, the most likely correct answer is that pulmonary fibrosis is not a recognized side effect of Cisplatin.\n\n### Final Analysis and Confidence Score\nThe analysis prioritizes well-established medical knowledge about the side effects of Cisplatin, recognizing ototoxicity, nephrotoxicity, and the coasting effect as common issues, while noting the absence of strong evidence for pulmonary fibrosis as a side effect. Given the clarity of the evidence for the first three side effects and the lack of specific association for the fourth, the confidence in this conclusion is high.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Cisplatin is known to cause ototoxicity, nephrotoxicity, and the coasting effect, all well-documented in medical literature. Pulmonary fibrosis, however, is not a recognized side effect of Cisplatin, as it lacks specific and robust evidence linking it to this particular chemotherapy drug. The decision is based on a clear consensus in the medical community regarding these side effects.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
