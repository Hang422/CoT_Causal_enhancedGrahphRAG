Produced by alpha cells of pancreas\nopb. Two polypeptide chains are bound by disulfide linkages\nopc. Shifts potassium outside the cell\nopd. S.c insulin tl/2 is 60 mins\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nThe only correct statement about insulin among the options is that it consists of two polypeptide chains bound by disulfide linkages. Insulin is produced by beta cells of the pancreas, not alpha cells, and it increases the uptake of potassium into cells, contrary to shifting it outside. The half-life of subcutaneously administered insulin is approximately 5-6 minutes, not 60 minutes. The provided evidence paths do not directly support these specific biochemical details.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Analyzing the provided options about insulin, we can determine the correct statement based on standard medical knowledge. Option opa is incorrect because insulin is produced by the beta cells of the pancreas, not the alpha cells. Option opc is incorrect as insulin actually promotes the uptake of potassium into the cells, rather than shifting it outside. Option opd states that the half-life of subcutaneously administered insulin is 60 minutes, which is incorrect; the actual half-life is much shorter, approximately 5-6 minutes. The correct answer is option opb, which states that insulin consists of two polypeptide chains bound by disulfide linkages. This is a well-established fact in biochemistry, supported by the structure and synthesis process of insulin as studied in molecular biology.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
