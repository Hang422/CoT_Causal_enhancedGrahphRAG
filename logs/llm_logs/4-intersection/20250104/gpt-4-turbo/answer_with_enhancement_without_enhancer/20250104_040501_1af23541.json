Carbamazepine\nopb. Vigabatrin\nopc. Sodium valproate\nopd. Lamotrigine\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nCarbamazepine, Sodium Valproate, and Lamotrigine are confirmed as mood stabilizers indicated for bipolar disorder, supported by evidence paths linking them with mood stabilizer interactions. Vigabatrin, however, is primarily used for epilepsy and is not indicated for bipolar disorder, as it lacks associations with mood stabilizer treatments relevant to bipolar disorder.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"In addressing the question of which drug is not indicated for the treatment of bipolar disorder, we start by confirming the use of each drug listed. Carbamazepine, Sodium Valproate, and Lamotrigine are well-documented and widely accepted as mood stabilizers used in the management of bipolar disorder. These drugs are known to help control mood swings, a key component in the treatment of bipolar disorder. On the other hand, Vigabatrin is primarily used as an antiepileptic drug and does not have an indication for bipolar disorder. It is primarily used to treat seizures and lacks evidence of efficacy as a mood stabilizer in bipolar disorder. Therefore, based on standard medical knowledge and the enhanced information provided, Vigabatrin does not align with the treatment protocols for bipolar disorder.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
