Vitamin B9\nopb. Vitamin B12\nopc. Vitamin B6\nopd. Vitamin B3\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nIsoniazid, a medication used primarily for tuberculosis treatment, is known to interfere with vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) metabolism. This interference occurs because isoniazid inhibits the enzyme pyridoxine kinase, which is crucial for the activation of vitamin B6. As a result, patients on isoniazid are at an increased risk of developing vitamin B6 deficiency. This deficiency can lead to impaired neurotransmitter synthesis, potentially causing neurological symptoms. The evidence paths confirm that pyridoxine treats vitamin B6 deficiency and that isoniazid's interaction with pyridoxine metabolism leads to increased demand and depletion of vitamin B6 stores. There is no substantial evidence linking isoniazid use directly to the metabolism of vitamins B12, B9, or B3, and these vitamins are likely unaffected by isoniazid treatment.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Isoniazid is a medication primarily used for the treatment of tuberculosis. A well-documented side effect of isoniazid is its interference with the metabolism of vitamin B6 (pyridoxine). This occurs because isoniazid inhibits the enzyme pyridoxine kinase, which is essential for converting vitamin B6 into its active form. As a result, patients on isoniazid are at an increased risk of developing a vitamin B6 deficiency, which can lead to neurological symptoms due to impaired neurotransmitter synthesis. The evidence clearly supports that the deficiency most likely to be seen in patients on isoniazid is that of vitamin B6, not vitamins B12, B9, or B3, as there is no substantial evidence linking isoniazid with the metabolism of these other vitamins.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opc\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
