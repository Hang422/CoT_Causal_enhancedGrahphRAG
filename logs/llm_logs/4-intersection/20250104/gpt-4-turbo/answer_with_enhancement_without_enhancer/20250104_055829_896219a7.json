Strongyloidiasis\nopb. Trichomoniasis\nopc. Schistosomiasis\nopd. Rhinosporidiosis\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nPraziquantel is an antiparasitic medication primarily effective against certain flatworms, including the parasites that cause Schistosomiasis. It is not effective against nematodes, protozoa, or fungi, and therefore does not treat Strongyloidiasis, Trichomoniasis, or Rhinosporidiosis. The evidence path confirming Rhinosporidiosis as a fungal infection supports the reasoning that Praziquantel, being ineffective against fungi, is not suitable for treating Rhinosporidiosis. Thus, Praziquantel is correctly used for the treatment of Schistosomiasis.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Praziquantel is a well-established antiparasitic medication primarily used for the treatment of infections caused by certain species of flatworms, particularly the schistosomes, which are responsible for Schistosomiasis. This aligns with standard medical knowledge and pharmacological consensus. The other options listed, such as Strongyloidiasis, Trichomoniasis, and Rhinosporidiosis, are caused by different types of organisms (nematodes, protozoa, and fungi respectively), against which Praziquantel is ineffective. Therefore, based on the known pharmacological action of Praziquantel and its target organisms, the correct answer is that it is used for the treatment of Schistosomiasis.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opc\",\n  \"confidence\": 100\n}",
