Patient gives history of recurrent bacterial infections. Ophthalmic examination reveals white triangular plaques on conjunctiva. This patient is suffering from deficiency of:\n\n                    ### Options\n                    opa. Vitamin D\nopb. Vitamin B\nopc. Vitamin A\nopd. Vitamin C\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nThe patient's symptoms of diminished night vision, dry eyes, and white triangular plaques on the conjunctiva (Bitot's spots), along with a history of recurrent bacterial infections, strongly suggest a deficiency of Vitamin A. Night blindness and xerophthalmia (dryness of the eyes) are classic signs of Vitamin A deficiency. Bitot's spots are specifically associated with this deficiency and are not typically linked to deficiencies of Vitamins D, B, or C. Vitamin A is also crucial for maintaining a healthy immune system, which aligns with the patient's history of recurrent infections. The evidence paths confirm the association between these symptoms and Vitamin A deficiency, particularly highlighting the direct causes of night blindness and xerophthalmia due to this deficiency. Other vitamins mentioned do not show a direct link to the combination of symptoms presented by the patient.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "
