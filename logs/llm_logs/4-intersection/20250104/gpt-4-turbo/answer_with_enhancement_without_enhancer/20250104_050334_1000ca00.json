Stagnant hypoxia\nopb. Anemic hypoxia\nopc. Hypoxic hypoxia\nopd. Histotoxic hypoxia\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nShock primarily causes hypoxic hypoxia, characterized by inadequate tissue perfusion and reduced oxygen delivery to tissues. While shock can lead to conditions that might cause other types of hypoxia, such as anemic hypoxia in cases of severe blood loss, the direct and most common outcome is hypoxic hypoxia. Evidence paths regarding fluid loss and perfusion procedures support the systemic effects of shock but do not alter the fundamental understanding of its impact on oxygen delivery.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Shock is a critical condition that primarily affects the circulation system, leading to inadequate tissue perfusion and oxygen delivery. The core medical principle in understanding the types of hypoxia caused by shock is recognizing that the primary issue is the insufficient supply of oxygen to the tissues, which aligns with the definition of hypoxic hypoxia. Hypoxic hypoxia occurs when there is a reduction in the partial pressure of oxygen in the blood, typically due to respiratory issues or poor blood flow, which is a hallmark of shock. While shock can potentially lead to other forms of hypoxia, such as anemic hypoxia from blood loss, the most direct and common outcome from shock itself is hypoxic hypoxia. This is supported by the enhanced information provided, which emphasizes that shock leads to reduced oxygen delivery due to inadequate perfusion, fitting the description of hypoxic hypoxia. Therefore, based on the consensus and the enhanced information, the most likely correct answer is hypoxic hypoxia.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opc\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
