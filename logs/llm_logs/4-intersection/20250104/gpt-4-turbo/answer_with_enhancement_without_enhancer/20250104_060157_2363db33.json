Liver\nopb. Adipose tissue\nopc. RBC\nopd. Brain\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nThe HMP shunt is present in the liver, brain, and adipose tissue due to their involvement in processes requiring NADPH and ribose-5-phosphate. In contrast, mature red blood cells lack the necessary enzymes and organelles for the HMP shunt, making them the only listed option without this metabolic pathway.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The Hexose Monophosphate (HMP) shunt, also known as the pentose phosphate pathway, is crucial for producing NADPH and ribose-5-phosphate, which are essential for various metabolic processes including fatty acid synthesis and nucleotide synthesis. The liver, brain, and adipose tissue all require these metabolic products for their functions, such as detoxification in the liver, neurotransmitter synthesis in the brain, and lipid storage and synthesis in adipose tissue. These organs have the cellular machinery to support the HMP shunt. In contrast, mature red blood cells (RBCs) lack organelles such as mitochondria and a nucleus, and are limited in their metabolic capabilities. Specifically, mature RBCs do not have the necessary enzymes to carry out the HMP shunt. Therefore, based on standard medical knowledge and the consensus on metabolic pathways present in different tissues, RBCs are the correct answer as they do not possess the HMP shunt pathway.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opc\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
