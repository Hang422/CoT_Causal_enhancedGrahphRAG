Xylose\nopb. Mannose\nopc. Glucose\nopd. Ribose\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nGlucose is the only sugar among the options that is absorbed in the intestine against a concentration gradient, utilizing an energy-dependent active transport mechanism. Other sugars like xylose and ribose are absorbed via passive or facilitated diffusion, which do not work against the concentration gradient. Mannose, despite its structural similarity to glucose, lacks clear evidence of being absorbed against a concentration gradient in the same manner as glucose.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The absorption of sugars in the intestine involves different mechanisms, including passive diffusion, facilitated diffusion, and active transport. Among the options provided, glucose is well-documented in medical literature as being absorbed through an active transport mechanism, specifically via the sodium-glucose linked transporter (SGLT1), which operates against a concentration gradient and requires energy. This process is crucial for efficient glucose uptake, especially when luminal glucose concentrations are low relative to intracellular concentrations. Xylose and ribose are primarily absorbed through facilitated diffusion, which does not work against a concentration gradient. Mannose, although structurally similar to glucose, does not have strong evidence supporting active transport against a concentration gradient in the intestine similar to that of glucose. Therefore, based on the consensus and standard medical knowledge, glucose is the correct answer.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opc\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
