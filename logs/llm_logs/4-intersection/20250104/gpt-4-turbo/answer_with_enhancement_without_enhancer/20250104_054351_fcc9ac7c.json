Fatty acids\nopb. Ketone bodies\nopc. Glucose\nopd. Any of the above\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nUnder normal conditions, the primary source of energy for cardiac muscle is fatty acids. This is supported by the consensus that fatty acids are the predominant substrate utilized by the myocardium for energy metabolism. While cardiac muscle can also metabolize glucose and ketone bodies, these are not the primary sources under normal conditions. Glucose is indeed utilized by cardiac muscle, but it is secondary to fatty acids. Ketone bodies are typically used under conditions of fasting or low carbohydrate intake, making them a less likely primary source under normal conditions. The evidence paths confirm the role of fatty acids in energy metabolism processes in the myocardium, reinforcing their status as the main energy source under typical conditions.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The primary source of energy for cardiac muscle under normal conditions is fatty acids. This is well-supported by medical consensus, which indicates that fatty acids are the predominant substrate utilized by the myocardium for energy metabolism. While cardiac muscle can also metabolize glucose and ketone bodies, these sources are secondary and conditional, respectively. Glucose is used, but not as the primary source under normal conditions, and ketone bodies are typically utilized under specific metabolic states such as fasting or low carbohydrate intake. Therefore, the best-supported option, aligning with the standard medical knowledge, is that fatty acids are the main source of energy for cardiac muscle under typical conditions.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
