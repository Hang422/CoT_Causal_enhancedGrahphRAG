Clindamycin\nopb. Cefepime\nopc. Metronidazole\nopd. Azithromycin\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nAzithromycin is the preferred drug for treating both gonococcal and non-gonococcal urethritis due to its effectiveness against Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis. Clinical guidelines support its use for these indications, making it an optimal choice for dual treatment of these infections. Other options like cefepime, metronidazole, and clindamycin do not adequately cover both pathogens and are not recommended as first-line treatments for urethritis.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The treatment of urethritis, whether gonococcal or non-gonococcal, requires an antibiotic that effectively targets the causative organisms, primarily Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis. Azithromycin is widely recommended in clinical guidelines for this purpose due to its broad spectrum of activity that covers both these pathogens. It is administered as a single dose, which improves compliance and effectiveness in treating sexually transmitted infections. Other options listed, such as Clindamycin, Cefepime, and Metronidazole, do not provide the necessary coverage against both Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis, and are therefore not recommended as first-line treatments for urethritis. Based on standard medical knowledge and current clinical guidelines, Azithromycin is the most appropriate and effective choice for treating both gonococcal and non-gonococcal urethritis.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
