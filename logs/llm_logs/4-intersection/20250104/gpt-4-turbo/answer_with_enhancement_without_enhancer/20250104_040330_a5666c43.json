Proximal tubule\nopb. Distal tubules\nopc. Loop of Henle\nopd. Collecting duct\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nAldosterone primarily acts on the distal tubules and the collecting duct of the kidney. It binds to mineralocorticoid receptors in these locations to regulate sodium reabsorption, enhance potassium excretion, and maintain electrolyte balance and blood pressure. This action is crucial for maintaining homeostasis in the body.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Aldosterone is a hormone that plays a critical role in the regulation of electrolyte and fluid balance by acting on the kidneys. Its primary sites of action are the distal tubules and the collecting duct. In these locations, aldosterone binds to mineralocorticoid receptors, leading to increased reabsorption of sodium and water into the bloodstream, while enhancing the excretion of potassium. This mechanism is vital for maintaining blood pressure and electrolyte homeostasis. The enhanced information provided aligns well with standard medical knowledge, confirming that aldosterone acts predominantly on the distal tubules and the collecting duct. Therefore, the best-supported option, considering both the standard medical consensus and the contextual support, is that aldosterone acts on the distal tubules and the collecting duct.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
