Hyponatremia\nopb. Hyperkalemia\nopc. Hypoglycemia\nopd. Metabolic alkalosis\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nAdrenal insufficiency leads to hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, and hypoglycemia due to decreased production of aldosterone and cortisol, respectively. However, it is not associated with metabolic alkalosis; instead, it typically leads to metabolic acidosis. This understanding is supported by evidence linking aldosterone's role in kidney functions and cortisol's role in glucose metabolism.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "### Core Medical Principle:\nAdrenal insufficiency involves the underproduction of hormones like cortisol and aldosterone by the adrenal glands. This condition affects various body systems, notably electrolyte balance and glucose metabolism.\n\n### Analysis:\n- **Hyponatremia (opa)**: Adrenal insufficiency leads to a decrease in aldosterone, which helps regulate sodium and water balance in the body. Reduced aldosterone levels cause the kidneys to excrete more sodium, leading to hyponatremia.\n- **Hyperkalemia (opb)**: Similarly, with decreased aldosterone, the kidneys excrete less potassium, resulting in higher blood potassium levels, or hyperkalemia.\n- **Hypoglycemia (opc)**: Cortisol, another hormone produced by the adrenal glands, has important roles in glucose metabolism, including the stimulation of gluconeogenesis. A deficiency in cortisol can lead to decreased glucose production and hypoglycemia.\n- **Metabolic alkalosis (opd)**: Adrenal insufficiency typically leads to metabolic acidosis, not alkalosis. This is due to the reduced excretion of hydrogen ions and reabsorption of bicarbonate in the kidneys when aldosterone levels are low.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBased on the standard medical understanding of adrenal insufficiency's impact on body systems, metabolic alkalosis is not associated with adrenal insufficiency. Instead, this condition is more likely to cause metabolic acidosis due to the reasons outlined above. The enhanced information provided aligns well with this consensus in medical literature.\n\n### Final Output:\n```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Adrenal insufficiency is associated with hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, and hypoglycemia due to the roles of aldosterone and cortisol. It typically leads to metabolic acidosis rather than metabolic alkalosis, as aldosterone deficiency disrupts normal acid-base balance towards acidosis.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
