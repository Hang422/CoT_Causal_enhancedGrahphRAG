You would be concerned about the use of this drug if the patient also had what comorbid condition\n\n                    ### Options\n                    opa. Glaucoma\nopb. Essential tremor\nopc. Diabetes\nopd. Supraventricular tachycardia\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nPropranolol, a beta-blocker used post-myocardial infarction, can mask hypoglycemia symptoms, posing a risk in diabetic patients by potentially leading to unrecognized hypoglycemic episodes. This concern is supported by evidence paths linking diabetes, glucose homeostasis, and hypoglycemic agents. In contrast, propranolol's use in conditions like essential tremor and supraventricular tachycardia is therapeutic and not concerning. Incorrect concerns about exacerbating glaucoma through reduced aqueous humor production are clarified, as this mechanism is actually a treatment approach in glaucoma.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Propranolol is a non-selective beta-blocker commonly used in the management of cardiovascular conditions, including post-myocardial infarction therapy. However, its use in diabetic patients requires careful consideration due to its potential to mask the symptoms of hypoglycemia. This masking effect can lead to unrecognized and therefore untreated hypoglycemic episodes, which are dangerous. The other conditions listed (glaucoma, essential tremor, and supraventricular tachycardia) do not present a similar level of concern with propranolol use. In fact, propranolol is often used therapeutically for essential tremor and supraventricular tachycardia, and it can also decrease aqueous humor production, which is beneficial in glaucoma. Therefore, the most concerning comorbid condition in the context of propranolol use following a myocardial infarction is diabetes.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opc\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
