Methimazole\nopb. Propylthiouraril\nopc. Carbimazole\nopd. Perchlorate\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nPropylthiouracil is the preferred treatment for hyperthyroidism in the first trimester of pregnancy due to its lower risk of teratogenic effects compared to Methimazole. Methimazole and its pro-drug Carbimazole, which is metabolized to Methimazole, carry higher teratogenic risks and are not recommended during the first trimester. Perchlorate, being less effective and less studied for managing hyperthyroidism in pregnancy, is not considered a first-line treatment. The evidence path confirming Propylthiouracil's use in treating hyperthyroidism supports its safety and efficacy in this specific context.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The management of hyperthyroidism during pregnancy, particularly in the first trimester, requires careful consideration of the safety profiles of available medications. Methimazole and Carbimazole (which is converted to Methimazole in the body) are associated with higher risks of teratogenic effects, such as congenital malformations, when used during the first trimester. Propylthiouracil, on the other hand, is generally considered safer for use during the first trimester due to its lower risk of causing birth defects compared to Methimazole. Perchlorate is not commonly used as a first-line treatment due to its lower efficacy and limited data on safety in pregnancy. Based on standard medical guidelines and consensus, Propylthiouracil is the preferred choice for treating hyperthyroidism in the first trimester of pregnancy. This aligns with the enhanced information provided, which supports the use of Propylthiouracil due to its safety profile.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
