Aldosterone\nopb. DOCA\nopc. Fludrocoeisone\nopd. Triamcinolone\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nAldosterone is the most potent mineralocorticoid, produced by the adrenal cortex and effectively binding to mineralocorticoid receptors to increase sodium reabsorption and potassium excretion. Evidence confirms its role and interaction with these receptors, emphasizing its significant effect on electrolyte balance and blood pressure regulation. Other corticosteroids like DOCA and Fludrocortisone, while also binding to these receptors, are less potent compared to aldosterone. Triamcinolone primarily shows glucocorticoid activity with minimal mineralocorticoid effects.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Aldosterone is recognized as a key mineralocorticoid produced by the adrenal cortex, primarily involved in regulating sodium and potassium balance through its action on mineralocorticoid receptors. This function is crucial for maintaining blood pressure and electrolyte balance. The other options provided, such as DOCA (Deoxycorticosterone acetate) and Fludrocortisone, also exhibit mineralocorticoid activity, but they are generally considered less potent in comparison to aldosterone in terms of natural physiological roles and receptor affinity. Triamcinolone, on the other hand, is primarily known for its glucocorticoid effects rather than mineralocorticoid effects, making it the least relevant in this context. Based on standard medical knowledge and the consensus in endocrinology, aldosterone is the most potent mineralocorticoid among the options listed.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
