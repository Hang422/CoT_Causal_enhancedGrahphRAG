Pyrazinamide\nopb. Isoniazid\nopc. Ethambutol\nopd. Rifampicin\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nRifampicin induces hepatic enzymes, increasing the metabolism of indinavir and reducing its effectiveness, compromising HIV treatment. It should be avoided in HIV-positive patients on indinavir. Pyrazinamide, isoniazid, and ethambutol do not significantly interact with indinavir, zidovudine, or lamivudine, and are safe for use in this patient.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The core medical principle in this scenario involves understanding drug interactions, particularly how anti-tubercular drugs interact with antiretroviral therapy in HIV-positive patients. Rifampicin is known to induce hepatic enzymes, which can increase the metabolism of certain drugs, including indinavir, a protease inhibitor used in HIV treatment. This induction leads to reduced plasma concentrations of indinavir, potentially compromising its effectiveness in controlling HIV infection. The other drugs listed, such as Pyrazinamide, Isoniazid, and Ethambutol, do not significantly interact with the antiretroviral medications mentioned (zidovudine, lamivudine, and indinavir), making them safer choices in this context. Therefore, Rifampicin should be avoided in this patient to maintain effective HIV therapy. This decision aligns with standard medical guidelines and pharmacological knowledge about drug interactions.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
