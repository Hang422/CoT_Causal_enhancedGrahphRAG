Single dose in ascariasis\nopb. Immunostimulant\nopc. Paralysis of worms by depolarisation\nopd. Immunodepressant in high doses\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nLevamisole is correctly used as an anthelmintic effective in single doses for ascariasis, and as an immunostimulant. It causes paralysis of worms by depolarization, not hyperpolarization. There is no consensus supporting its use as an immunodepressant at high doses; this is a misunderstanding of its potential overstimulation effects on the immune system.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Levamisole is primarily known for its use as an anthelmintic agent, particularly effective in treating ascariasis with a single dose, which aligns with option 'opa'. It also functions as an immunostimulant, supporting the immune system, which is consistent with option 'opb'. The mechanism by which Levamisole works includes the paralysis of worms through depolarization, confirming the accuracy of option 'opc'. Regarding option 'opd', the claim that Levamisole acts as an immunodepressant in high doses is not supported by standard medical consensus. While high doses might lead to complications or side effects, categorizing these effects as immunodepression is incorrect and not supported by reliable medical literature or consensus. Therefore, the most likely incorrect use of Levamisole, as listed in the options, is as an immunodepressant in high doses.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
