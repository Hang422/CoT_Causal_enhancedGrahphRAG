Diclofenac\nopb. Acetaminophen\nopc. Ibuprofen\nopd. Naproxen\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nAcetaminophen, not a traditional NSAID, causes minimal gastric irritation compared to NSAIDs like Diclofenac, Ibuprofen, and Naproxen, which are associated with moderate to high gastric irritation. This aligns with its pharmacological profile of minimal COX enzyme inhibition, making it the safest option in terms of gastric side effects among the listed drugs.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The question asks which drug among the listed options causes the least gastric irritation. Acetaminophen, listed as option B, is technically not a traditional NSAID (Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drug) but is often grouped with them in discussions due to its pain-relieving properties. Unlike traditional NSAIDs such as Diclofenac, Ibuprofen, and Naproxen, Acetaminophen does not significantly inhibit COX enzymes, which are largely responsible for the gastric irritation associated with NSAIDs. This lack of COX inhibition results in minimal gastric side effects compared to the other options listed. Therefore, based on the pharmacological profile and the consensus in medical literature, Acetaminophen causes the least gastric irritation among the options provided.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
