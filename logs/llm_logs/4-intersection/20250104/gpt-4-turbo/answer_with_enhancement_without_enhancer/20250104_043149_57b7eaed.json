Monotherapy for acute episodes\nopb. Monitoring of serum concentration is not useful for guiding dose adjustment\nopc. Can result in leucocytosis\nopd. Can result in hypehyroidism on long term use\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nLithium, used in the treatment of manic-depressive psychosis, can result in leucocytosis, a generally benign side effect. It requires monitoring of serum concentrations for safe dose adjustments. Lithium is not typically effective as monotherapy for acute episodes and is associated with hypothyroidism, not hyperthyroidism, on long-term use.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "### Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\n1. **Monotherapy for acute episodes (opa)**: Lithium is often used in the management of bipolar disorder, particularly in the maintenance phase to prevent or mitigate the severity of future manic or depressive episodes. However, it is not typically effective as monotherapy for acute manic episodes, where faster-acting medications are generally preferred.\n\n2. **Monitoring of serum concentration is not useful for guiding dose adjustment (opb)**: This statement is incorrect. Monitoring serum lithium concentrations is crucial for effective and safe treatment. Lithium has a narrow therapeutic window, and its serum levels must be monitored to avoid toxicity while ensuring therapeutic efficacy.\n\n3. **Can result in leucocytosis (opc)**: Lithium has been documented to cause leucocytosis, which is an increase in white blood cells. This is generally a benign side effect and does not typically require cessation of therapy unless accompanied by other more severe side effects.\n\n4. **Can result in hyperthyroidism on long-term use (opd)**: This statement is incorrect. Lithium use is more commonly associated with hypothyroidism rather than hyperthyroidism. Monitoring thyroid function is recommended during long-term treatment with lithium.\n\n### Final Analysis\nBased on the standard medical knowledge and the enhanced information provided, the most accurate statement about lithium use in manic-depressive psychosis is that it can result in leucocytosis. This aligns with both the consensus in medical literature and the contextual support provided. The other options either misrepresent lithium's efficacy as monotherapy, incorrectly dismiss the importance of serum monitoring, or inaccurately describe its impact on thyroid function.\n\n### Confidence Score\nGiven the clarity of the medical consensus on these aspects of lithium use, the confidence in this answer is high.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Lithium is known to cause leucocytosis, a generally benign increase in white blood cells, which aligns with both standard medical knowledge and the enhanced information provided. Other options presented either inaccuracies or misrepresentations of lithium's use and effects in manic-depressive psychosis.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opc\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
