Mouth\nopb. Stomach\nopc. Small intestine\nopd. Large intestine\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nDigestion of disaccharides primarily occurs in the small intestine. Disaccharides such as sucrose, lactose, and maltose are broken down into monosaccharides by specific enzymes called disaccharidases, including lactase, sucrase, and maltase, which are located in the small intestine. This is supported by the evidence path indicating the presence of disaccharidases in the small intestine. The mouth, through the action of salivary amylase, initiates the breakdown of polysaccharides like starch into smaller chains and some maltose, but not the digestion of disaccharides. The stomach's acidic environment deactivates salivary amylase and does not facilitate significant disaccharide digestion. The large intestine does not have disaccharidase enzymes and mainly involves the fermentation of undigested carbohydrates by microbiota. Therefore, the correct answer to where disaccharide digestion occurs is the small intestine.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

This is facilitated by enzymes known as disaccharidases, which include lactase, sucrase, and maltase. These enzymes are specifically located in the small intestine and are responsible for breaking down disaccharides into monosaccharides, which are simpler sugars that can be absorbed by the body. The mouth is involved in the breakdown of polysaccharides through salivary amylase, but this does not extend to disaccharides. The stomach's acidic environment deactivates salivary amylase, thus not supporting disaccharide digestion. Furthermore, the large intestine does not contain disaccharidases and primarily deals with the fermentation of undigested carbohydrates by the microbiota. Based on these facts, the most accurate location for disaccharide digestion is the small intestine.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opc\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
