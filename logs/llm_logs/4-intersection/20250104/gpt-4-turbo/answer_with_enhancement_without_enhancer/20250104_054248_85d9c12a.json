Increases liver glycogenolysis\nopb. Causes broachiolar constriction\nopc. Evokes extrasystoles in the heart\nopd. Produces restlessness and anxiety\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nEpinephrine, when administered in high doses intravenously, increases liver glycogenolysis, evokes extrasystoles in the heart, and produces restlessness and anxiety, all supported by biochemical pathways and receptor interactions. However, it does not cause bronchiolar constriction; it causes bronchiolar relaxation, contrary to one of the options provided.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Epinephrine, a catecholamine, acts primarily on alpha and beta-adrenergic receptors. When administered intravenously at high doses, it is known to increase liver glycogenolysis due to its action on beta-adrenergic receptors, enhancing glucose production. It also evokes extrasystoles in the heart, which are premature heartbeats, by its stimulatory effect on cardiac beta-1 adrenergic receptors. Additionally, epinephrine can produce restlessness and anxiety, likely due to its overall stimulatory effects on the central nervous system and cardiovascular system. Importantly, epinephrine causes bronchiolar relaxation, not constriction, by activating beta-2 adrenergic receptors in the bronchial smooth muscle. This is a critical aspect of its use in treating conditions like asthma and other bronchoconstrictive disorders. Therefore, the statement that epinephrine causes bronchiolar constriction is incorrect, making it the option that does not align with the known actions of epinephrine when administered intravenously at high doses.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
