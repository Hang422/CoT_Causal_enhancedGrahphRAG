Chlorothiazide\nopb. Beta blockers\nopc. ACE inhibitors\nopd. Amlodipine\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nACE inhibitors are contraindicated with spironolactone due to the compounded risk of hyperkalemia, as both increase blood potassium levels. This interaction is well-documented and advised against unless under strict medical supervision. Beta blockers and amlodipine do not significantly affect potassium levels, while chlorothiazide may help balance the potassium-sparing effect of spironolactone.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The primary medical concern with combining spironolactone with other medications is the risk of hyperkalemia, a condition characterized by elevated potassium levels in the blood, which can lead to serious cardiac issues. Spironolactone is a potassium-sparing diuretic, meaning it helps the body retain potassium while excreting sodium and water. ACE inhibitors, which include drugs like lisinopril and enalapril, also increase potassium levels in the blood by inhibiting the enzyme that converts angiotensin I to angiotensin II, a process that typically promotes potassium excretion. Combining spironolactone with ACE inhibitors can therefore significantly increase the risk of hyperkalemia. This interaction is well-documented in medical literature and clinical practice guidelines, which typically advise against this combination unless under close medical supervision and frequent monitoring of potassium levels. The other options, including beta blockers, amlodipine, and chlorothiazide, do not share this specific contraindication. Beta blockers and amlodipine primarily affect blood pressure and heart rate without significant impact on potassium levels, while chlorothiazide, a thiazide diuretic, actually promotes potassium excretion, potentially counterbalancing the potassium-sparing effect of spironolactone.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opc\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
