      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in the field of Biochemistry.\n                    You are a medical expert determining the final answer.\n\n            ### Instructions:\n            - Use standard medical knowledge as the primary guide.\n            - Consider enhanced information only if it aligns with consensus.\n            - If conflicting or unclear, present the most likely correct answer based on known facts.\n            - It's acceptable to show moderate confidence if the question is complex, but still choose one best answer.\n\n\n                    ### Question\n                    Essential amino acids are all except:\n\n                    ### Options\n                    opa. Leucine\nopb. Lysine\nopc. Methionine\nopd. Proline\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nAmong the options provided, Leucine, Lysine, and Methionine are classified as essential amino acids, which means they must be obtained through the diet as the human body cannot synthesize them. Proline, on the other hand, is a non-essential amino acid because it can be synthesized by the human body. Therefore, the correct answer to the question 'Essential amino acids are all except:' is Proline. The evidence paths provided, although broad, confirm the involvement of these amino acids in cellular processes but do not directly impact the classification of these amino acids as essential or non-essential.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The question requires identifying which among the listed amino acids is not essential. Essential amino acids are those that the human body cannot synthesize and must be obtained through the diet. Leucine, Lysine, and Methionine are well-known essential amino acids, necessary for various metabolic and physiological processes. Proline, however, is classified as a non-essential amino acid because the human body can synthesize it. This classification is well-supported by standard biochemistry knowledge, aligning with the consensus in the field.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 98\n}",
