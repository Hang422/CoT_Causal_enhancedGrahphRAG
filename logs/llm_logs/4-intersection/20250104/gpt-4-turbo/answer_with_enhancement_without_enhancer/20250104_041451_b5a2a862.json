Duodenum\nopb. Ileum\nopc. Jejunum\nopd. Colon\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nVitamin B12, when bound to intrinsic factor, is absorbed in the ileum of the small intestine. This absorption is facilitated by specific receptors present only in the ileum, confirming the unique role of this section of the intestine in Vitamin B12 uptake.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The absorption of Vitamin B12, when bound to intrinsic factor, is a well-documented physiological process that occurs in the ileum of the small intestine. This is supported by standard medical knowledge which states that the ileum contains specific receptors that facilitate the uptake of Vitamin B12 bound to intrinsic factor. The other sections of the intestine, such as the duodenum, jejunum, and colon, do not have these specific receptors and thus do not play a primary role in the absorption of Vitamin B12. The enhanced information provided aligns with this consensus, further confirming the ileum as the correct location for this absorption process.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 98\n}",
