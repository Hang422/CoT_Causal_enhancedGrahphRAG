Drug implicated is?\n\n                    ### Options\n                    opa. Streptomycin\nopb. Isoniazid\nopc. Ethambutol\nopd. Rifampicin\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nStreptomycin, an aminoglycoside antibiotic, is known for its ototoxic effects, which can damage the auditory nerve leading to symptoms such as deafness and tinnitus. This aligns with medical consensus and is supported by evidence paths linking Streptomycin with ototoxicity. Other antitubercular drugs like Isoniazid, Ethambutol, and Rifampicin are less likely to cause these auditory symptoms based on their typical side effect profiles.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The primary concern here is the identification of an anti-tubercular drug causing deafness and tinnitus. Among the options provided, Streptomycin is well-documented for its ototoxic effects, which can manifest as hearing loss and tinnitus. This aligns with the known side effect profile of aminoglycosides, a class of antibiotics to which Streptomycin belongs. Ototoxicity is a recognized and significant adverse effect of Streptomycin, supported by both clinical evidence and pharmacological consensus. The other drugs listed - Isoniazid, Ethambutol, and Rifampicin - primarily have different side effect profiles and are less commonly associated with auditory complications. Therefore, based on the symptoms described and the typical side effects of the medications listed, Streptomycin is the most likely cause of the auditory symptoms experienced by the patient.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
