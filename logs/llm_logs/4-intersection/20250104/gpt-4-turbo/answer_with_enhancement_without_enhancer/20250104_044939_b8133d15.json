Striated\nopb. Large T tubules\nopc. Troponin system present\nopd. Caldesmon is impoant regulatory protein\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nCardiac muscle is striated and utilizes the troponin system for contraction, but contrary to option B, it has smaller T tubules compared to skeletal muscle. Caldesmon, mentioned in option D, is significant in smooth muscle, not cardiac muscle, where troponin and tropomyosin are the primary regulatory proteins. Thus, option D is the correct answer as it incorrectly attributes caldesmon as a regulatory protein in cardiac muscle.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "### Core Medical Principle:\nCardiac muscle shares several features with skeletal muscle, such as being striated and using the troponin system for contraction regulation. However, it differs in certain structural and regulatory proteins compared to skeletal and smooth muscles.\n\n### Analysis:\n- **Option A (Striated)**: Cardiac muscle is indeed striated, similar to skeletal muscle, which helps in the organized contraction mechanism.\n- **Option B (Large T tubules)**: Cardiac muscle has T tubules, but they are generally smaller than those found in skeletal muscle. However, the term \"large\" is relative and could be misleading without specific context. In comparison to smooth muscle, cardiac muscle T tubules could be considered large.\n- **Option C (Troponin system present)**: The troponin system is a key regulatory mechanism in cardiac muscle, similar to skeletal muscle, facilitating the process of muscle contraction by binding calcium.\n- **Option D (Caldesmon is an important regulatory protein)**: Caldesmon is primarily associated with smooth muscle, not cardiac muscle. In cardiac muscle, the regulation of contraction is predominantly controlled by proteins such as troponin and tropomyosin.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBased on the standard medical knowledge, cardiac muscle does not use caldesmon as a regulatory protein. This makes option D the correct answer as it incorrectly attributes caldesmon as a regulatory protein in cardiac muscle, which is not supported by medical consensus.\n\n### Final Output:\n```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"After evaluating each option against standard medical knowledge, it is clear that caldesmon is not a regulatory protein in cardiac muscle, but rather in smooth muscle. This aligns with the consensus in medical literature, confirming that option D is the correct answer.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
