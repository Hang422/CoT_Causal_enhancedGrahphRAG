Propanolol\nopb. Aiprazolam\nopc. Buspirone\nopd. Haloperidol\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nPropranolol, while a beta-blocker used for cardiovascular issues, is sometimes used off-label for physical symptoms of anxiety but is not a primary treatment for anxiety disorders. Alprazolam, a benzodiazepine, is directly indicated and commonly prescribed for anxiety disorders. Buspirone is specifically approved for treating generalized anxiety disorder and acts on serotonin receptors. Haloperidol, an antipsychotic, is primarily used for schizophrenia and acute psychosis and is not typically used for anxiety. Therefore, Haloperidol is the drug among the options that is not used for treating anxiety.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Analyzing the provided options for medications not used for anxiety, we find that Propranolol, Alprazolam, and Buspirone have roles in the management of anxiety. Propranolol, a beta-blocker, is often used off-label to manage physical symptoms of anxiety such as palpitations and tremors, particularly in performance anxiety. Alprazolam is a benzodiazepine, well-known and frequently prescribed specifically for anxiety disorders due to its efficacy in reducing anxiety symptoms. Buspirone is approved for the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder, working through serotonin receptors and providing an anxiolytic effect without the sedative effects typical of benzodiazepines. Haloperidol, however, is an antipsychotic primarily used for managing schizophrenia and acute psychotic states and is not typically utilized for anxiety disorders. Its use in anxiety would be highly atypical and not supported by standard medical guidelines. Therefore, based on the consensus and typical medical practice, Haloperidol is the correct answer as it is not used for treating anxiety.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
