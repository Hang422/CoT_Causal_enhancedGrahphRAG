Discoid lupus erythematous\nopb. Rheumatoid ahritis\nopc. Infectious mononucleosis\nopd. All of the above\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nChloroquine is effectively used in the treatment of Discoid Lupus Erythematosus and can be beneficial in Rheumatoid Arthritis but is not suitable for the treatment of Infectious Mononucleosis. The evidence paths and reasoning chains confirm and support these applications, aligning well with medical consensus.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Chloroquine is a medication primarily known for its use in the treatment of malaria and certain autoimmune diseases. According to standard medical knowledge, chloroquine is used in the management of Discoid Lupus Erythematosus (DLE), a chronic skin condition. It is also used in the treatment of Rheumatoid Arthritis, where it can help reduce inflammation and pain. However, there is no evidence supporting the use of chloroquine in the treatment of Infectious Mononucleosis, a viral infection typically caused by the Epstein-Barr virus. Therefore, while chloroquine is effective for both DLE and Rheumatoid Arthritis, it is not suitable for Infectious Mononucleosis. The enhanced information provided aligns with this consensus, confirming the use of chloroquine in DLE and Rheumatoid Arthritis but not in Infectious Mononucleosis.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}",
