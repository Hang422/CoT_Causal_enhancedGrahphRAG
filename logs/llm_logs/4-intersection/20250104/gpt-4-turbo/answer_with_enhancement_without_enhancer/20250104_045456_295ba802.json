Vitamin A\nopb. Vitamin C\nopc. Vitamin D\nopd. Vitamin B12\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nVitamin D is the most effective among the listed vitamins in reducing the risk of insulin resistance, obesity, and metabolic syndrome. It enhances insulin sensitivity through its role in calcium metabolism, which is directly linked to lower risks of insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome, as supported by both biochemical consensus and evidence paths.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Vitamin D is recognized for its role in bone health due to its ability to aid calcium absorption. Beyond this, there is substantial evidence suggesting that Vitamin D also plays a significant role in metabolic processes, including the regulation of insulin and glucose metabolism. Research indicates that Vitamin D can enhance insulin sensitivity, which is crucial in preventing insulin resistanceâ€”a key component of metabolic syndrome, which also encompasses conditions like obesity. The enhanced information provided aligns with existing medical consensus that Vitamin D can reduce the risk of insulin resistance, obesity, and metabolic syndrome, making it the most supported option among those listed.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opc\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}",
