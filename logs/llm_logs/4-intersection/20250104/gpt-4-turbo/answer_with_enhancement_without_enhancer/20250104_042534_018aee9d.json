Fibrinolysis\nopb. Activation of collagenase\nopc. Destruction of VWF\nopd. Stabilization of fibrin\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nPlasmin is primarily involved in fibrinolysis by breaking down fibrin clots and also activates collagenase by converting pro-collagenase to its active form. It can degrade von Willebrand factor, impacting blood clotting processes. However, plasmin does not stabilize fibrin; rather, it breaks it down, contradicting the claim of fibrin stabilization. This understanding excludes misleading interpretations and focuses on plasmin's established functions in line with medical consensus.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Plasmin is a crucial enzyme in the process of fibrinolysis, where it breaks down fibrin clots, a key component in the blood clotting process. This aligns with the function listed in option 'opa'. Additionally, plasmin is involved in the activation of collagenase, as it converts pro-collagenase to its active form, supporting the function mentioned in option 'opb'. Plasmin also has a role in the degradation of von Willebrand factor (VWF), which is crucial in clotting, aligning with option 'opc'. However, plasmin's primary action on fibrin is to break it down, not to stabilize it. Therefore, option 'opd', which suggests that plasmin stabilizes fibrin, contradicts its well-established role in fibrinolysis. Based on the consensus in medical literature and the functions generally attributed to plasmin, option 'opd' is the incorrect function and does not align with the known actions of plasmin.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
