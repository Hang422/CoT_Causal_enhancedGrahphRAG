Penicillin G\nopb. Tetracycline\nopc. Azithromycin\nopd. Doxycycline\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nPenicillin G is the drug of choice for treating Treponema pallidum, the causative agent of syphilis, as recommended by the CDC. It is effective at all stages of the disease due to its bactericidal effect, which involves disrupting bacterial cell wall synthesis. For patients allergic to penicillin, Doxycycline serves as an alternative treatment, though it is less effective than Penicillin G. Other antibiotics like Azithromycin and Tetracycline can be used in some cases but are generally less preferred due to potential resistance and side effects. The evidence path confirming Treponema pallidum as the cause of syphilis supports the relevance of these treatments.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The primary consideration in selecting a treatment for Treponema pallidum, the bacterium responsible for syphilis, is the effectiveness and recommendation by authoritative health bodies such as the CDC. Penicillin G is widely recognized and recommended as the first-line treatment for all stages of syphilis due to its bactericidal action, which effectively disrupts the synthesis of the bacterial cell wall, leading to the death of the bacterium. This makes it highly effective against Treponema pallidum. For patients who are allergic to penicillin, alternatives like Doxycycline are considered, though they are generally seen as less effective compared to Penicillin G. Other options such as Azithromycin and Tetracycline are also available but are less preferred due to issues like potential resistance and side effects. Given this consensus and the strong recommendation from health authorities, Penicillin G is the most appropriate choice.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
