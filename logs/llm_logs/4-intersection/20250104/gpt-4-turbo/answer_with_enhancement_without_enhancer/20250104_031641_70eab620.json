Acute renal failure\nopb. Development of antiplatelet antibodies\nopc. Encephalitis secondary to liver dysfunction\nopd. Hemorrhagic stroke\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nThe most likely adverse effect of fibrinolytic drugs in the treatment of acute myocardial infarction is hemorrhagic stroke. This is due to the increased risk of bleeding associated with the breakdown of blood clots by these drugs, a well-documented effect supported by both medical consensus and evidence paths linking hemorrhage to hemorrhagic stroke.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Fibrinolytic drugs are primarily used in the treatment of acute myocardial infarction to dissolve blood clots that are blocking the coronary arteries. The core medical principle here is the mechanism of action of fibrinolytics, which involves breaking down the fibrin in blood clots. While this action is beneficial for restoring blood flow to the heart, it also increases the risk of bleeding elsewhere in the body. Among the options provided, hemorrhagic stroke is a recognized and serious adverse effect of fibrinolytic therapy. This is because the systemic action of these drugs can lead to bleeding in the brain, particularly in the presence of uncontrolled hypertension or other risk factors. The other options, such as acute renal failure, development of antiplatelet antibodies, and encephalitis secondary to liver dysfunction, are not typically associated with the use of fibrinolytics in the context of acute myocardial infarction. Therefore, based on medical consensus and the mechanism of action of fibrinolytics, hemorrhagic stroke is the most likely adverse effect.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
