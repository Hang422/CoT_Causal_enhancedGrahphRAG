Nimodipine\nopb. Amlodipine\nopc. Diltiazem\nopd. Verapamil\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nNimodipine is the most appropriate drug indicated for subarachnoid hemorrhage primarily due to its specific effectiveness in preventing cerebral vasospasm, a common and serious complication of subarachnoid hemorrhage. While other calcium channel blockers like Amlodipine, Diltiazem, and Verapamil are also mentioned, they lack the specificity that Nimodipine has for cerebral arteries. Based on medical consensus and supported evidence, Nimodipine is the most effective and specifically indicated calcium channel blocker for this condition.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The core medical principle in the treatment of subarachnoid hemorrhage involves the prevention of cerebral vasospasm, a potentially life-threatening complication. Nimodipine, a calcium channel blocker, is specifically indicated for this purpose due to its preferential effect on cerebral arteries, which helps in reducing the incidence of cerebral vasospasm following a subarachnoid hemorrhage. Other calcium channel blockers like Amlodipine, Diltiazem, and Verapamil, although effective in other cardiovascular conditions, do not have the same specificity or evidence supporting their use in the prevention of cerebral vasospasm associated with subarachnoid hemorrhage. Therefore, based on medical consensus and supported evidence, Nimodipine is the most appropriate and effective choice for this indication.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
