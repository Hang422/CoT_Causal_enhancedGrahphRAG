Vasopressin\nopb. Terlipressin\nopc. Desmopressin\nopd. Pralipressin\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nNeurogenic diabetes insipidus, characterized by a deficiency of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) due to issues in the posterior pituitary gland, leads to symptoms like excessive urination and thirst. Desmopressin, a synthetic analogue of ADH, effectively treats this condition by mimicking ADH, thus reducing urine output and increasing urine osmolality. It is the drug of choice for neurogenic diabetes insipidus, aligning with medical consensus and supported by evidence that Desmopressin is used to treat central diabetes insipidus.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Neurogenic diabetes insipidus, also known as central diabetes insipidus, is primarily caused by a deficiency of antidiuretic hormone (ADH), which is produced in the hypothalamus and stored in the posterior pituitary gland. This condition leads to frequent urination and increased thirst due to the kidneys' inability to conserve water. The treatment involves replacing ADH to mitigate these symptoms. Desmopressin (DDAVP) is a synthetic analogue of ADH that is preferred for its longer duration of action and fewer side effects compared to natural ADH. It effectively mimics the action of natural ADH, thus reducing the symptoms of diabetes insipidus by decreasing urine output and increasing urine concentration. The other options listed, such as Vasopressin, Terlipressin, and Pralipressin, are also analogues of ADH but are not the primary choices for treating neurogenic diabetes insipidus. Desmopressin is specifically tailored for long-term management due to its efficacy and safety profile, making it the drug of choice for this condition. This aligns with the medical consensus and is supported by clinical practice and guidelines.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opc\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
