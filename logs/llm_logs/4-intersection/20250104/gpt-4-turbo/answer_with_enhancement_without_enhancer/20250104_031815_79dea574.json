Which of the following enzymes is defective?\n\n                    ### Options\n                    opa. Fructokinase\nopb. Aldolase A\nopc. Aldolase B\nopd. Sucrase\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nThe symptoms of vomiting, lethargy, and severe jaundice in the baby are indicative of Hereditary Fructose Intolerance, caused by a deficiency in Aldolase B. This enzyme is crucial for fructose metabolism, and its deficiency leads to the accumulation of toxic metabolites in the liver, manifesting as severe metabolic disturbances. The other enzymes listed, while involved in carbohydrate metabolism, do not lead to the symptoms observed when deficient in the context of fructose ingestion.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The symptoms described in the scenario - vomiting, lethargy, and severe jaundice upon the introduction of fruit juice - are characteristic of Hereditary Fructose Intolerance (HFI). HFI is a condition where the body lacks the enzyme Aldolase B, which is essential for the proper metabolism of fructose. This deficiency leads to the accumulation of fructose-1-phosphate in the liver, causing severe metabolic disturbances including hypoglycemia, liver dysfunction, and jaundice. The other enzymes listed, such as Fructokinase, Aldolase A, and Sucrase, while involved in carbohydrate metabolism, do not result in the severe symptoms seen in HFI when deficient. Fructokinase deficiency leads to a benign condition known as Essential Fructosuria, Aldolase A deficiency is associated with muscle issues, and Sucrase deficiency leads to Sucrase-Isomaltase Deficiency, which primarily causes gastrointestinal symptoms like diarrhea and bloating but not jaundice or lethargy. Therefore, based on the symptoms and the role of Aldolase B in fructose metabolism, the most likely enzyme deficiency in this case is Aldolase B.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opc\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
