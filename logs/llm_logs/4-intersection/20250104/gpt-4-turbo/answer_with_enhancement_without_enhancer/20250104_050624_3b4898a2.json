Meningitis\nopb. Pericarditis\nopc. Ileo-caecal tuberculosis\nopd. Adrenal involvement\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nSteroids are indicated for tuberculosis meningitis, pericarditis, and adrenal involvement due to their anti-inflammatory effects and hormone replacement role. However, they are not typically required for ileo-caecal tuberculosis, where surgery and specific anti-tuberculosis medications are preferred. This aligns with medical consensus and is supported by relevant evidence paths.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Steroids are used in the treatment of certain forms of tuberculosis primarily for their anti-inflammatory effects and, in some cases, for hormone replacement. In tuberculosis meningitis, steroids help reduce inflammation of the meninges, which is crucial to prevent serious complications such as brain damage. In tuberculosis pericarditis, steroids are used to reduce the inflammation of the pericardium, thereby preventing constrictive pericarditis. In cases of adrenal involvement in tuberculosis, which can lead to adrenal insufficiency, steroids serve as a critical hormone replacement therapy. However, in ileo-caecal tuberculosis, which primarily involves the ileum and caecum parts of the gastrointestinal tract, the primary treatment involves anti-tuberculosis medications and potentially surgery to manage complications like obstruction or perforation. Steroids do not play a central role in the management of ileo-caecal tuberculosis as the condition does not primarily involve issues that steroids are used to address, such as significant inflammation or hormone deficiency. This aligns with medical consensus and is supported by standard treatment guidelines.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opc\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
