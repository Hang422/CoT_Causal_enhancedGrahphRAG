Hypervolemia\nopb. Hypeension\nopc. Hypovolemia\nopd. Decrease osmolarity\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nHypovolemia, characterized by decreased blood volume, leads to increased secretion of ADH as the body conserves water to increase blood volume and maintain blood pressure. This physiological response is a direct and potent stimulus for ADH release, aligning with medical consensus.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Antidiuretic hormone (ADH), also known as vasopressin, is primarily involved in regulating water balance in the body. It is secreted by the posterior pituitary gland and acts to conserve water by reducing its loss in urine. ADH secretion is typically stimulated by conditions that require the body to conserve water, such as increased plasma osmolarity (higher solute concentration in the blood) or decreased blood volume. Among the options provided: Hypervolemia (increased blood volume) and decreased osmolarity would typically lead to a decrease in ADH secretion as they indicate an excess of water. Hypertension (high blood pressure) does not directly correlate with ADH secretion unless it is related to a volume status change. Hypovolemia (decreased blood volume), however, directly stimulates ADH secretion as the body needs to conserve water to maintain blood pressure and volume. This aligns with the physiological response to prevent further volume depletion and is a well-supported medical consensus.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opc\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
