This hormone is:\n\n                    ### Options\n                    opa. Endothelial growth factor (EGF)\nopb. Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG)\nopc. Human chorionic somatotropin (HCS)\nopd. Relaxin\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nHuman chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) is the hormone secreted by the placenta utilized in the early detection of pregnancy. This is supported by consistent reasoning chains and evidence paths linking hCG with pregnancy tests. Other hormones such as EGF, HCS, and Relaxin, though produced by the placenta, are not used in early pregnancy detection.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The hormone utilized in the early detection of pregnancy is human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). This hormone is secreted by the placenta shortly after the embryo attaches to the uterine lining. The presence of hCG in a woman's blood or urine is a reliable indicator of pregnancy, which is why it is commonly used in pregnancy tests. The other hormones listed, such as Endothelial Growth Factor (EGF), Human Chorionic Somatotropin (HCS), and Relaxin, are indeed produced by the placenta but do not play a role in the early detection of pregnancy. The consensus in medical literature and practice supports the use of hCG as the primary marker for early pregnancy detection, aligning with the enhanced information provided.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 98\n}",
