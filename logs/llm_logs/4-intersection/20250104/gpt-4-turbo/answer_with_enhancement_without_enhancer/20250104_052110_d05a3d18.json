Leydig cells\nopb. Seolie cells\nopc. Seminiferous tubules\nopd. Epididymis\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nTestosterone production in males is primarily carried out by Leydig cells, located in the interstitial tissue of the testes. These cells are specifically responsible for the synthesis of testosterone, crucial for male sexual development and reproductive function. Other structures like Sertoli cells, seminiferous tubules, and the epididymis, while important in the reproductive system, do not primarily contribute to testosterone production.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The primary site of testosterone production in males is the Leydig cells, which are located in the interstitial tissue of the testes. These cells are specifically tasked with the synthesis of testosterone, a key hormone in male sexual development and reproductive functions. The other options provided, such as Sertoli cells, seminiferous tubules, and the epididymis, play significant roles in the male reproductive system but are not the primary sites for testosterone production. Sertoli cells support and nourish developing sperm cells, seminiferous tubules are involved in sperm production, and the epididymis functions in sperm maturation and storage. Based on standard medical knowledge and the consensus in physiological understanding, Leydig cells are the correct answer.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
