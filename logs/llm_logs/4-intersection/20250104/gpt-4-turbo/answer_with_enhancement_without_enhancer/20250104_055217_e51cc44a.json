Tyrosine transaminase\nopb. Tyrosine hydroxylase\nopc. Phenylalanine hydroxylase\nopd. Phenylketonuria hydroxylase\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nPhenylketonuria is primarily caused by a deficiency in the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase. This enzyme is responsible for converting phenylalanine into tyrosine. When phenylalanine hydroxylase is deficient, phenylalanine accumulates in the body, leading to phenylketonuria. This is supported by evidence paths showing a direct link between phenylalanine hydroxylase and increased blood phenylalanine levels, which predispose individuals to phenylketonuria. Other enzymes like tyrosine transaminase and tyrosine hydroxylase, involved in different metabolic pathways, do not lead to phenylketonuria when deficient. The term 'phenylketonuria hydroxylase' appears to be a misnomer or confusion, likely intended to refer to phenylalanine hydroxylase. Therefore, the correct answer to the question of what deficiency causes phenylketonuria is phenylalanine hydroxylase.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Phenylketonuria (PKU) is a genetic disorder characterized by a deficiency in the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase. This enzyme is crucial for the metabolic pathway that converts the amino acid phenylalanine into tyrosine. In the absence of functional phenylalanine hydroxylase, phenylalanine accumulates in the body, which can lead to various health issues including intellectual disability and other severe problems if not managed. The other options provided, such as tyrosine transaminase and tyrosine hydroxylase, are involved in different aspects of amino acid metabolism and their deficiencies lead to different metabolic disorders, not PKU. The term 'phenylketonuria hydroxylase' does not correspond to any known enzyme and seems to be a confusion or error, likely intended to refer to phenylalanine hydroxylase. Based on standard medical knowledge and the consensus in biochemical pathology, the correct answer is phenylalanine hydroxylase.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opc\",\n  \"confidence\": 98\n}",
