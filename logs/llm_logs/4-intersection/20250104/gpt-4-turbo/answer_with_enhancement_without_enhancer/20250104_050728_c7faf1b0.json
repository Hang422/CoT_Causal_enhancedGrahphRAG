Methotrexate\nopb. Doxorubicin\nopc. Cisplatin\nopd. Busulfan\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nMethotrexate and Busulfan are both associated with a higher risk of causing pulmonary fibrosis, a known complication in their use. Methotrexate's role in causing pulmonary toxicity that can lead to fibrosis is well-documented, as is Busulfan's, especially in the context of pre-bone marrow transplant chemotherapy. Doxorubicin, while less commonly associated with pulmonary fibrosis, still poses a risk. Cisplatin, primarily linked to nephrotoxicity and neurotoxicity, has the least association with pulmonary fibrosis among the options.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Pulmonary fibrosis is a serious lung condition characterized by progressive scarring of lung tissue. Among the drugs listed, both Methotrexate and Busulfan are known to be associated with the risk of inducing pulmonary fibrosis. Methotrexate is used in various chemotherapeutic and autoimmune disease treatments and has documented evidence of causing pulmonary toxicity, which can lead to fibrosis. Busulfan, often used in the preparatory regimen for bone marrow transplantation, also has a well-documented risk of pulmonary fibrosis. Doxorubicin and Cisplatin, while associated with other severe side effects, are less commonly linked to pulmonary fibrosis, with Cisplatin primarily causing nephrotoxicity and neurotoxicity. Given the stronger and more direct associations with pulmonary fibrosis, Methotrexate and Busulfan are the primary contenders. Between these, Methotrexate is more widely used and has a broader spectrum of documentation regarding pulmonary complications, making it a slightly more likely candidate for this specific side effect.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}",
