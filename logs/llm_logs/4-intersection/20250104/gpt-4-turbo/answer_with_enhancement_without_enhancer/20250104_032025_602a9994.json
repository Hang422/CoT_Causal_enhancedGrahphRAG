Atrial flutter\nopb. Parkinsonian tremor\nopc. Thyrotoxicosis\nopd. HOCM\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nPropranolol is effective in managing atrial flutter and thyrotoxicosis by reducing heart rate and blocking beta receptors, respectively. However, it is not typically useful for Parkinsonian tremor, where dopaminergic drugs are preferred, and may worsen conditions like Hypertrophic Obstructive Cardiomyopathy (HOCM) due to its negative inotropic effects.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "### Core Medical Principle:\nPropranolol is a non-selective beta-blocker widely used in various cardiovascular conditions due to its ability to block beta-adrenergic receptors, thereby reducing heart rate, blood pressure, and myocardial oxygen demand. Its applications extend to other areas based on these primary effects.\n\n### Analysis of Options:\n- **Atrial Flutter (opa)**: Propranolol is effective in managing atrial flutter primarily by reducing the heart rate, which helps control the rhythm disturbance.\n  \n- **Parkinsonian Tremor (opb)**: Propranolol is generally used for essential tremor, not Parkinsonian tremor. Parkinsonian tremor, which is associated with Parkinson's disease, typically responds better to dopaminergic medications rather than beta-blockers.\n  \n- **Thyrotoxicosis (opc)**: In thyrotoxicosis, propranolol is beneficial as it helps in controlling symptoms like tachycardia and anxiety by blocking the peripheral conversion of T4 to T3, along with its beta-blocking effects.\n  \n- **Hypertrophic Obstructive Cardiomyopathy (HOCM) (opd)**: Propranolol can be used in HOCM to reduce heart rate and improve diastolic filling, although care must be taken due to its negative inotropic effects which can potentially worsen the outflow obstruction under certain conditions.\n\n### Final Analysis:\nGiven the options and the typical uses of propranolol, the least appropriate use among the listed options is for Parkinsonian tremor. While propranolol is indeed used for some types of tremor, Parkinsonian tremor specifically involves mechanisms that are better targeted by dopaminergic therapy rather than by beta-blockade. The other conditions listed (atrial flutter, thyrotoxicosis, and HOCM) have established roles for the use of propranolol, albeit with some nuances in the case of HOCM.\n\n### Confidence Assessment:\nThe decision is based on standard pharmacological treatments for the conditions listed, with a clear distinction in the mechanism of action required for Parkinsonian tremor compared to the beta-adrenergic receptor blockade provided by propranolol.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Propranolol is not typically useful for Parkinsonian tremor, where dopaminergic drugs are preferred. This condition involves a different pathophysiological mechanism that is not primarily targeted by beta-blockers. The other conditions listed have established roles for the use of propranolol.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
