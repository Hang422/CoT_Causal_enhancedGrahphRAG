Vitamin A\nopb. Vitamin B\nopc. Vitamin C\nopd. Vitamin E\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nNyctalopia, or night blindness, is primarily caused by a deficiency in Vitamin A, which is essential for the production of rhodopsin, a pigment necessary for low-light vision. Deficiencies in Vitamins B, C, and E, while associated with other ocular and neurological issues, do not have a direct, established link to nyctalopia.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Nyctalopia, commonly known as night blindness, is a condition characterized by difficulty seeing in low light or darkness. This condition is primarily linked to a deficiency in Vitamin A. Vitamin A is crucial for the synthesis of rhodopsin, a pigment found in the retina that is vital for vision in low-light conditions. Deficiencies in other vitamins such as B, C, and E can lead to various health issues, but they are not directly associated with the development of nyctalopia. The consensus in medical literature supports Vitamin A deficiency as the cause of nyctalopia, aligning with the enhanced information provided. Therefore, the most likely correct answer, based on known medical facts and consensus, is Vitamin A.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
