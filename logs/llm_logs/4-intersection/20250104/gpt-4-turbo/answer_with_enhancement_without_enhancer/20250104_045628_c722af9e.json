All of the following are true about heparin except-\n\n                    ### Options\n                    opa. Weakest acid found in living things\nopb. Most commercial preparations of heparin now utilize pig intestinal slimes\nopc. Act via Antithrombin activation\nopd. Produce thrombocytopenia\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nHeparin, a sulfated glycosaminoglycan, is not the weakest acid found in living things, making this statement false and the correct answer to the question. Heparin is commonly sourced from pig intestinal mucosa, acts via antithrombin activation, and can produce thrombocytopenia, all of which are true statements supported by both the reasoning chains and relevant evidence paths.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Heparin is a well-known anticoagulant used in various medical settings, including cardiac surgery. It functions primarily through the activation of antithrombin, which in turn helps to inhibit thrombin and factor Xa, crucial components in the clotting cascade. This mechanism is well-documented and aligns with the statement in option 'opc'. Heparin is indeed sourced from pig intestinal mucosa, as stated in option 'opb', which is a common practice for the commercial production of heparin. Option 'opd' mentions that heparin can produce thrombocytopenia, which is a recognized side effect known as heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT); this is a serious complication but well-recognized in medical literature. The statement in option 'opa', describing heparin as the 'weakest acid found in living things', is incorrect. Heparin is a weak acid, but it is not the weakest acid in living organisms, as there are many other substances with lower pKa values. Therefore, based on the consensus and standard medical knowledge, option 'opa' is the correct answer as it is the only statement that is false.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
