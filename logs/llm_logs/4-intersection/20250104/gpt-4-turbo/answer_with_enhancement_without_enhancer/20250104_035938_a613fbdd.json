Adenylyl cyclase\nopc. Na+-K+-ATPase\nopd. Galactosyl transferase\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nAmong the options provided, 5'-nucleotidase, adenylyl cyclase, and Na+-K+-ATPase are all recognized as markers of the plasma membrane. 5'-nucleotidase is known for its role in the outer cell membrane where it hydrolyzes extracellular nucleotides. Adenylyl cyclase, involved in the generation of cAMP, is an integral membrane enzyme found in the plasma membrane. Na+-K+-ATPase, crucial for maintaining cellular ion gradients, is also a well-established component of the plasma membrane. In contrast, galactosyl transferase is primarily associated with the Golgi apparatus, not the plasma membrane, making it the correct answer as the enzyme not marking the plasma membrane. The evidence paths provided confirm the membrane associations for 5'-nucleotidase and adenylyl cyclase but do not directly address their specific cellular locations, thus their general relevance to cell membranes supports the consensus but is not decisive for this specific question.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The question requires identifying which of the listed enzymes is not a marker of the plasma membrane. Based on standard medical knowledge, 5'-nucleotidase, adenylyl cyclase, and Na+-K+-ATPase are well-established as plasma membrane markers. 5'-nucleotidase is involved in hydrolyzing extracellular nucleotides at the plasma membrane. Adenylyl cyclase, integral to cAMP production, is located in the plasma membrane and plays a role in signal transduction. Na+-K+-ATPase is crucial for ion gradient maintenance across the plasma membrane. In contrast, galactosyl transferase is primarily associated with the Golgi apparatus, where it functions in glycoprotein synthesis, rather than the plasma membrane. This aligns with the consensus in cellular biology, making galactosyl transferase the correct answer as it is not a marker of the plasma membrane.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
