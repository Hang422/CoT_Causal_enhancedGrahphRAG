Thiamine\nopb. Pyridoxine\nopc. Niacin\nopd. Riboflavin\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nThe treatment for INH-induced neuropathy is pyridoxine supplementation. Isoniazid causes neuropathy by interfering with pyridoxine metabolism, leading to a deficiency. Supplementing with pyridoxine replenishes vitamin B6, restores nerve function, and alleviates neuropathy symptoms. This approach is supported by medical consensus and evidence paths linking pyridoxine to the treatment of neuropathy associated with isoniazid use.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"INH (isoniazid) is a medication commonly used in the treatment of tuberculosis. One of the known side effects of isoniazid is the potential to cause neuropathy. This neuropathy is believed to occur due to isoniazid's interference with the metabolism of pyridoxine (vitamin B6), leading to a deficiency. The standard treatment for preventing or addressing INH-induced neuropathy is the supplementation of pyridoxine. This approach is well-supported in medical literature and is a consensus among healthcare professionals. The other options provided, such as Thiamine, Niacin, and Riboflavin, do not directly address the specific mechanism by which isoniazid causes neuropathy. Therefore, based on the consensus and the mechanism of action, pyridoxine is the correct choice for treating INH-induced neuropathy.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
