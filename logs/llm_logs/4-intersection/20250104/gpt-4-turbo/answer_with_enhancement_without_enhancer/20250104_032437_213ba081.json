Stomach\nopb. Duodenum\nopc. Ileum\nopd. Duodenum + Jejunum\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nIron is primarily absorbed in the duodenum and secondarily in the jejunum of the small intestine. This absorption process is supported by the anatomical connectivity between the stomach, duodenum, and jejunum, where iron is processed and moved through these sections for absorption. The evidence paths confirm the anatomical relationships and support the consensus that the duodenum, followed by the jejunum, are the main sites for iron absorption.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Iron absorption primarily occurs in the small intestine, specifically within the duodenum and to a lesser extent in the jejunum. This is supported by standard medical knowledge which highlights the duodenum as the main site for iron absorption due to its proximity to the stomach and its role in the initial stages of nutrient absorption. The enhanced information provided also supports this understanding by emphasizing the anatomical connectivity and functional roles of the duodenum and jejunum in iron absorption. Given that option 'opd' (Duodenum + Jejunum) includes both primary sites of iron absorption, it aligns best with the consensus in medical literature and the enhanced information provided.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
