Alpha IEN\nopb. Beta IFN\nopc. Gamma IFN\nopd. Natalizumab\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nBeta IFN is the drug of choice for relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) as it modulates the immune response and is approved as a first-line treatment due to its efficacy in reducing the frequency of relapses. Natalizumab, although effective in reducing inflammation and relapse rates by blocking immune cell migration to the CNS, is generally reserved for patients with inadequate response to first-line treatments like Beta IFN. Alpha IEN, with its antiviral and antiproliferative properties, is not primarily used for RRMS and is less effective in reducing relapse rates compared to Beta IFN. Gamma IFN is not recommended for RRMS treatment as it can potentially exacerbate autoimmune diseases by increasing the immune response.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The primary consideration in selecting a treatment for relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) is the drug's efficacy in reducing the frequency and severity of relapses, as well as its safety profile. Beta interferon (Beta IFN) is widely recognized and approved as a first-line treatment for RRMS. It works by modulating the immune response, which is crucial in a disease characterized by abnormal immune activity against the central nervous system. Clinical studies and practice guidelines support the use of Beta IFN due to its proven track record in reducing relapse rates and its relatively well-understood safety profile. Natalizumab is also effective but is typically reserved for cases where first-line treatments are inadequate due to its higher risk of serious side effects, such as progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy. Alpha interferon (Alpha IEN) and Gamma interferon (Gamma IFN) are not standard treatments for RRMS, with Gamma IFN potentially exacerbating the disease. Therefore, based on the consensus and standard medical guidelines, Beta IFN is the most appropriate choice for the initial management of RRMS.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
