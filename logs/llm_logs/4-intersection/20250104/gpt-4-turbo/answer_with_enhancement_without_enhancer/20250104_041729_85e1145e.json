Activation of protein kinase\nopb. Activation of adenylate cyclase\nopc. Ca2+ release.\nopd. All\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nCyclic AMP (cAMP) primarily functions through the activation of protein kinase A (PKA). cAMP binds to the regulatory subunits of PKA, leading to the release and activation of catalytic subunits that phosphorylate target proteins. This is supported by evidence paths showing interactions between cAMP and cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinases. Contrary to some claims, cAMP does not activate adenylate cyclase nor directly cause Ca2+ release. Its role is specific to the activation of PKA.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Cyclic AMP (cAMP) is a well-known second messenger involved in numerous signal transduction pathways. The primary mechanism by which cAMP exerts its effects is through the activation of protein kinase A (PKA). When cAMP levels increase within a cell, cAMP binds to the regulatory subunits of PKA, causing a conformational change that releases the catalytic subunits. These catalytic subunits then phosphorylate various target proteins, leading to changes in cell function. This pathway is well-documented and widely accepted in the field of physiology. The option suggesting that cAMP activates adenylate cyclase is incorrect, as adenylate cyclase is actually the enzyme responsible for the synthesis of cAMP from ATP, not a downstream target of cAMP. Additionally, cAMP does not directly cause Ca2+ release; while it may influence pathways that affect Ca2+ levels, this is not its primary action. Therefore, the correct answer, based on the consensus and the primary action of cAMP, is the activation of protein kinase.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
