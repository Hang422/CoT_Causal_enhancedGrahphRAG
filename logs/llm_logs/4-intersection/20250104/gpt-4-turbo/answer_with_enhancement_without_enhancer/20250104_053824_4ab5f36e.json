Flutamide\nopb. Finasteride\nopc. Prazosin\nopd. Minoxidil\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nFinasteride is a 5α reductase inhibitor that effectively reduces the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT), crucial for treating both benign prostatic hypertrophy and male pattern baldness. Evidence confirms the role of DHT in prostate and scalp structures, supporting finasteride's mechanism. Other options like Flutamide, Prazosin, and Minoxidil do not inhibit 5α reductase and thus do not affect DHT production.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The question requires identifying a 5α reductase inhibitor effective in treating both benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH) and male pattern baldness. Finasteride is known to inhibit the enzyme 5α reductase, which is responsible for converting testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT). DHT plays a significant role in the development of BPH and male pattern baldness. Finasteride's mechanism of action directly targets this pathway, making it effective for both conditions. The other options provided, such as Flutamide, Prazosin, and Minoxidil, do not function as 5α reductase inhibitors. Flutamide is an antiandrogen but does not inhibit the enzyme directly. Prazosin is an alpha-blocker used primarily for hypertension and BPH symptoms but does not affect DHT production. Minoxidil is used for hair growth but works through a different mechanism unrelated to DHT inhibition. Therefore, based on the standard medical knowledge and the consensus on the mechanism of action of these drugs, Finasteride is the correct answer.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
