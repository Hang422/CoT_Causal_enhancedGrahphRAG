Ascaris\nopb. Filariasis\nopc. Malaria\nopd. Oncocerciasis\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nIvermectin is effective against Ascaris, Filariasis, and Oncocerciasis, aligning with its known antiparasitic properties. However, it is not indicated for Malaria, as it does not target the Plasmodium species responsible for the disease. The reasoning chains for Ascaris, Filariasis, and Oncocerciasis are supported by evidence, while the chain for Malaria correctly notes Ivermectin's ineffectiveness against this infection, despite misleading broad evidence paths.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Ivermectin is a well-known antiparasitic medication primarily used for treating several parasitic infections. According to standard medical knowledge, Ivermectin is indicated for the treatment of Ascaris (a type of intestinal roundworm), Filariasis (caused by infection with filarial worms), and Oncocerciasis (also known as river blindness, caused by the worm Onchocerca volvulus). These indications align with Ivermectin's mechanism of action, which involves binding to invertebrate muscle and nerve cells of parasites, causing paralysis and death of the parasite. However, Ivermectin is not indicated for Malaria, as this disease is caused by Plasmodium parasites, which are protozoans, not helminths. Ivermectin does not affect Plasmodium species, thus it is not used in the treatment or prevention of Malaria. This conclusion is supported by both the standard medical consensus and the enhanced information provided, which correctly identifies the lack of efficacy of Ivermectin against Malaria.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opc\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
