Aprepitant\nopb. Dexamethasone\nopc. Ondansetrin\nopd. All of the above\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nAprepitant, Dexamethasone, and Ondansetron are all used to manage chemotherapy-induced vomiting, each acting through different mechanisms: Aprepitant as an NK1 receptor antagonist, Dexamethasone as a corticosteroid and antiemetic, and Ondansetron as a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist. These drugs are often used in combination to achieve a synergistic effect in preventing nausea and vomiting associated with chemotherapy.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The question asks for the drug used in managing chemotherapy-induced vomiting. Aprepitant acts as an NK1 receptor antagonist, Dexamethasone serves as a corticosteroid and antiemetic, and Ondansetron functions as a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist. Each of these drugs is utilized to prevent or manage nausea and vomiting induced by chemotherapy, often in combination to enhance efficacy through their different mechanisms of action. Given that all three drugs are recognized and used for this purpose, the correct answer must include all of them.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
