Salbutamol\nopb. Ketotifen\nopc. Fluticasone\nopd. Monteleukast\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nSalbutamol is the correct choice as it is a beta adrenergic agonist used as an aerosol for the treatment of bronchial asthma, aligning with medical consensus and supported by evidence paths linking beta adrenergic agonists with pharmaceutical preparations for asthma.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Salbutamol is a well-known beta adrenergic agonist commonly used in the treatment of bronchial asthma. It functions by relaxing the muscles in the airways and increasing air flow to the lungs, making it an effective treatment for asthma symptoms. The other options listed do not fit the criteria as closely: Ketotifen is an antihistamine used more for allergic conditions, Fluticasone is a corticosteroid used to reduce inflammation, and Montelukast is a leukotriene receptor antagonist used to manage asthma symptoms and prevent asthma attacks. Based on the standard medical knowledge and consensus, Salbutamol is the correct choice as it is specifically a beta adrenergic agonist used as an aerosol for asthma treatment.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
