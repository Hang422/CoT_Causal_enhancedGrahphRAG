Directly\nopb. IG1-1\nopc. Thyroxine\nopd. Intranuclear receptors\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nThe primary mechanism by which growth hormone affects growth is through its stimulation of the liver to produce insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1). IGF-1 then acts on various tissues to promote growth. This pathway is well-supported by both the reasoning chains and the evidence paths provided, aligning with the standard medical consensus.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Growth hormone primarily influences growth by stimulating the liver to produce insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), which then acts on various tissues to promote growth. This pathway is well-documented and aligns with the standard medical consensus. The option 'IG1-1' seems to be a typographical error for 'IGF-1', which is the correct mediator of growth hormone's effects according to the established physiological mechanisms. Therefore, despite the typographical error in the option, it is clear that this is the intended correct answer.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
