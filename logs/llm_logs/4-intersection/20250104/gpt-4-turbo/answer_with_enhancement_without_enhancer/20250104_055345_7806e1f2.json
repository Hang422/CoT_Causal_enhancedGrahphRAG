Stroma\nopb. Corpora albicans\nopc. Corpora lutea\nopd. Mature follicles\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nProgesterone production in the ovary primarily occurs in the corpora lutea. This structure, which forms from the remnants of the follicle post-ovulation, is the main site for significant progesterone synthesis, essential for maintaining the uterine lining and supporting early pregnancy. Other ovarian structures like mature follicles, corpora albicans, and the stroma play lesser roles in progesterone production.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Progesterone is a crucial hormone in the female reproductive system, primarily involved in preparing and maintaining the uterus for pregnancy. After ovulation, the follicle transforms into the corpora lutea, which is responsible for the bulk of progesterone production during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. This hormone supports the uterine lining and prepares it for potential implantation of an embryo. The other options provided, such as the stroma, corpora albicans, and mature follicles, have roles in the ovary but do not primarily produce significant amounts of progesterone compared to the corpora lutea. The stroma mainly provides structural support, corpora albicans are the degenerated remains of the corpora lutea and do not secrete hormones, and while mature follicles produce some hormones, they are more focused on estrogen production prior to ovulation. Therefore, based on standard medical knowledge and the consensus in physiological understanding, the corpora lutea is the primary site for progesterone production in the ovary.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opc\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
