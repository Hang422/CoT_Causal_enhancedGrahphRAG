Bromocriptine\nopb. Haloperidol\nopc. Reserpine\nopd. Chlorpromazine\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nBromocriptine is a dopamine agonist that decreases prolactin secretion, thus it does not cause hyperprolactinemia. This aligns with the standard medical consensus that dopamine agonists inhibit prolactin release. The evidence path indicating Bromocriptine's interaction with dopamine supports this mechanism. In contrast, Haloperidol and Chlorpromazine, both dopamine antagonists, increase prolactin secretion and are known to cause hyperprolactinemia. Reserpine, which depletes dopamine, may also increase prolactin secretion and potentially cause hyperprolactinemia. Therefore, among the options provided, only Bromocriptine does not cause hyperprolactinemia.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The core medical principle involved in this question is the regulation of prolactin secretion by dopamine. Dopamine agonists, such as Bromocriptine, inhibit prolactin release, thereby reducing the risk of hyperprolactinemia. This aligns with the standard medical consensus and the pharmacological action of Bromocriptine. In contrast, Haloperidol and Chlorpromazine, which are dopamine antagonists, and Reserpine, which depletes dopamine, are known to potentially increase prolactin levels, leading to hyperprolactinemia. Therefore, based on the mechanism of action and the consensus in medical literature, Bromocriptine is the correct answer as it does not cause hyperprolactinemia.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
