Dexamethasone\nopb. Betamethasone\nopc. Hydrocoisone\nopd. Prednisolone\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nDexamethasone is the preferred treatment for a pregnant female suspected of having a baby with congenital adrenal hyperplasia to prevent virilization. It effectively crosses the placenta and does not activate fetal adrenal glands, aligning with medical consensus and supported by evidence linking it to the treatment of virilism.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The core medical principle in treating a pregnant female suspected of having a baby with congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) is to prevent virilization of the female fetus. Dexamethasone is the drug of choice in this scenario because it effectively crosses the placenta and does not activate fetal adrenal glands, which is crucial for preventing the overproduction of androgens that lead to virilization. This choice is supported by medical consensus and evidence, making it the most appropriate option among the ones listed. Other corticosteroids like betamethasone, hydrocortisone, and prednisolone are less preferred for this specific prenatal purpose due to differences in placental crossing and potency.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
