None of the above\nopb. Albumin\nopc. Globulins\nopd. Chylomicrons\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nFree fatty acids are primarily transported in the bloodstream bound to albumin, which facilitates their transport to tissues like the liver and muscle for oxidation in the mitochondria. This is supported by evidence showing interactions between albumins and fatty acids. Chylomicrons and globulins do not play significant roles in this specific transport process.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The core medical principle in question involves the transport mechanism of free fatty acids (FFAs) in the bloodstream to mitochondria for oxidation. Free fatty acids, when released into the bloodstream, are primarily bound to albumin. Albumin serves as a carrier protein that facilitates the transport of these fatty acids to various tissues, including the liver and muscle, where they are oxidized in the mitochondria. The role of albumin in the transport of FFAs is well-documented and widely accepted in biochemistry and medical literature. Chylomicrons, on the other hand, are involved in the transport of dietary lipids from the intestines to other parts of the body but are not primarily responsible for the transport of FFAs to mitochondria for oxidation. Globulins generally play roles in the immune system and other functions but are not key players in the transport of FFAs. Therefore, based on the consensus and the enhanced information provided, albumin is the correct answer for the transport of FFAs to mitochondria for oxidation.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
