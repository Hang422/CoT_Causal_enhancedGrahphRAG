He has a history of being treated for duodenal ulcer 4 years back. Investigation reveals elevation of gastrin levels. Which of the following statement is true regarding gastrin?\n\n                    ### Options\n                    opa. Secreted by parietal cells of stomach\nopb. Secreted by alpha ceils of pancreas\nopc. Decreases bicarbonate content in pancreatic secretion\nopd. It gets stimulated by endoluminal peptides in stomach\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nGastrin is a hormone primarily secreted by G cells located in the antrum of the stomach, not by parietal cells or alpha cells of the pancreas, making options A and B incorrect. Gastrin's primary function is to stimulate gastric acid secretion from parietal cells and does not directly influence the bicarbonate content in pancreatic secretion, thus option C is incorrect. Gastrin secretion is indeed stimulated by the presence of amino acids and peptides in the stomach, which aligns with the physiological response to food intake, confirming option D as correct. This understanding is supported by standard physiological consensus and not directly enhanced by the broad evidence paths provided.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

It is not secreted by parietal cells or alpha cells of the pancreas, which rules out options A and B. Gastrin's function includes stimulating gastric acid secretion from parietal cells and it does not have a direct role in altering the bicarbonate content of pancreatic secretion, thus eliminating option C. The secretion of gastrin is stimulated by the presence of amino acids and peptides in the stomach, which is a response to food intake. This aligns with the physiological understanding of gastrin's role in digestion and confirms option D as the correct answer based on medical consensus.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
