Lipase\nopb. Pepsinogens\nopc. HCI\nopd. None\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nThe stomach secretes pepsinogens, HCl, and lipase. Pepsinogens and HCl are crucial for protein digestion and creating an acidic environment, respectively. Lipase is also secreted by the stomach but plays a less significant role compared to its secretion in the pancreas. Therefore, all options listed are secreted by the stomach, making 'None' the correct answer.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The stomach is known to secrete several substances that aid in digestion. Among these, pepsinogens are precursors to the enzyme pepsin, which is crucial for the breakdown of proteins in the stomach. Hydrochloric acid (HCl) is secreted by the parietal cells of the stomach and serves to create an acidic environment that is necessary for the activation of pepsin from pepsinogens, as well as for killing bacteria and denaturing proteins. Lipase, although more commonly associated with the pancreas, is also secreted in small amounts by the stomach and assists in the digestion of fats. Given that all these substances are indeed secreted by the stomach, the correct answer to the question of which is not secreted by the stomach is 'None'. This aligns with the enhanced information provided and standard medical knowledge.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
