Collecting duct\nopb. Glomerulus\nopc. Proximal convoluted tubule\nopd. Loop of Henle\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nAldosterone primarily acts in the collecting duct of the kidney, where it binds to mineralocorticoid receptors to increase sodium reabsorption and potassium excretion, crucial for maintaining blood pressure and electrolyte balance. This action is supported by evidence confirming aldosterone's interaction with mineralocorticoid receptors. Other nephron segments like the glomerulus, proximal convoluted tubule, and loop of Henle show minimal or insignificant effects from aldosterone, aligning with medical consensus.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Aldosterone is a hormone known for its role in regulating sodium and potassium balance in the body. It primarily acts on the collecting ducts of the kidneys. Here, aldosterone binds to mineralocorticoid receptors, leading to increased reabsorption of sodium into the bloodstream and increased excretion of potassium into the urine. This mechanism is crucial for maintaining blood pressure and electrolyte balance. The other parts of the nephron, such as the glomerulus, proximal convoluted tubule, and loop of Henle, do not significantly interact with aldosterone in terms of its primary function of sodium and potassium regulation. This understanding is well-supported by physiological evidence and aligns with medical consensus.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
