Krabbe's disease\nopb. Fabry's disease\nopc. Fragile syndrome\nopd. All\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nKrabbe's disease, Fabry's disease, and Fragile X syndrome are not glycogen storage diseases. Krabbe's and Fabry's are lysosomal storage disorders, while Fragile X syndrome is a genetic disorder affecting the X chromosome, primarily associated with intellectual disabilities. None of these conditions involve the specific enzymatic pathways disrupted in glycogen storage diseases. Therefore, the correct answer is 'All,' as none of the options listed are types of glycogen storage diseases.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Glycogen storage diseases are a group of disorders that involve the storage and mobilization of glycogen in the body. These diseases are characterized by specific enzyme deficiencies that affect glycogen metabolism, leading to excessive accumulation of glycogen in tissues. Krabbe's disease and Fabry's disease are classified as lysosomal storage disorders, not glycogen storage diseases. They involve different enzymatic pathways and accumulate different substances within the lysosomes. Fragile X syndrome is a genetic disorder linked to the X chromosome and is primarily associated with intellectual disabilities and does not involve glycogen storage pathways. Therefore, none of the conditions listed in the options are glycogen storage diseases. Based on this understanding, the correct answer is that all the options listed are exceptions to glycogen storage diseases.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 100\n}",
