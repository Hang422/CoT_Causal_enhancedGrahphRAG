Outer hair cells in basal area\nopb. Inner hair cells in basal area\nopc. Outer hair cells in apical area\nopd. Inner hair cells in apical area\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nAminoglycosides predominantly damage the outer hair cells in the basal area of the cochlea. This conclusion is supported by both the medical consensus on the specific susceptibility of these cells to ototoxic effects and the interactions highlighted in the evidence paths involving key cochlear genes and structures.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Aminoglycosides are a class of antibiotics known for their potential ototoxic effects, particularly in the cochlea of the inner ear. The ototoxicity primarily manifests as damage to hair cells, which are essential for hearing. The consensus in medical literature indicates that aminoglycosides predominantly affect the outer hair cells rather than the inner hair cells. Furthermore, the damage is more pronounced in the basal turn of the cochlea compared to the apical area. This is due to the higher susceptibility of the outer hair cells in the basal area to the ototoxic effects of aminoglycosides. The enhanced information provided aligns with this understanding, reinforcing the conclusion that aminoglycosides primarily damage the outer hair cells in the basal area of the cochlea.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
