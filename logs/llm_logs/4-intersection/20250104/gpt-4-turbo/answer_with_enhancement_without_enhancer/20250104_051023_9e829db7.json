Streptomycin\nopb. Ethambutol\nopc. Capreomycin\nopd. Rifampicin\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nRifampicin is the safest antitubercular drug for use in severe renal failure due to its primary metabolism by the liver, posing minimal risk of toxicity. Ethambutol can be used with careful dose adjustments and monitoring. Streptomycin and Capreomycin are not recommended due to their primary renal excretion, which increases the risk of toxicity in patients with severe renal failure.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "### Core Medical Principle:\nIn the management of tuberculosis in patients with severe renal failure, it is crucial to select antitubercular drugs that are primarily metabolized by the liver rather than the kidneys to avoid accumulation and potential toxicity.\n\n### Analysis of Options:\n- **Streptomycin (opa)**: This drug is primarily excreted by the kidneys, and its use in patients with severe renal failure could lead to toxic accumulation. Therefore, it is generally not recommended without significant dose adjustments and careful monitoring.\n  \n- **Ethambutol (opb)**: Ethambutol is also excreted through the kidneys, and while it can be used in renal failure, it requires careful dose adjustments and monitoring to avoid optic neuritis and other toxic effects.\n  \n- **Capreomycin (opc)**: Similar to Streptomycin, Capreomycin is also primarily excreted by the kidneys and poses a high risk of toxicity in patients with renal failure. It is typically not recommended without stringent monitoring.\n  \n- **Rifampicin (opd)**: Rifampicin is primarily metabolized by the liver, which makes it a safer choice in patients with severe renal failure as it does not accumulate significantly in the body due to renal impairment.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBased on the core medical principle and the metabolism of these drugs, Rifampicin is the safest option for use in patients with severe renal failure. It is metabolized by the liver, thereby minimizing the risk associated with renal excretion and accumulation.\n\n### Final Analysis:\nGiven the metabolism pathways of the drugs listed and the need to avoid renal toxicity in patients with severe renal failure, Rifampicin stands out as the most appropriate choice. It aligns well with the medical consensus on managing tuberculosis in patients with compromised renal function. The other drugs either require significant dose adjustments or are generally avoided in such conditions due to their renal clearance mechanisms.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Rifampicin is primarily metabolized by the liver, making it a safer choice in patients with severe renal failure compared to the other options, which are primarily cleared by the kidneys and pose a higher risk of toxicity.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
