Propanolol\nopb. Oral contraceptives\nopc. Reserpine\nopd. Flupenthixol\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nDepression is not a side effect of Flupenthixol. While Propranolol, Oral Contraceptives, and Reserpine have mechanisms that can lead to depression, Flupenthixol, primarily an antipsychotic, does not directly cause depression and is sometimes used to manage depressive symptoms in certain cases.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "### Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\n1. **Review of Each Option:**\n   - **Propranolol:** This is a beta-blocker commonly used to treat high blood pressure and other conditions. It is known to potentially cause depression as a side effect due to its CNS effects.\n   - **Oral Contraceptives:** These can influence mood and may lead to depression in some users, likely due to hormonal changes and their impact on neurotransmitters.\n   - **Reserpine:** An antihypertensive medication that depletes catecholamines (like norepinephrine and dopamine) in the brain, which can lead to depressive symptoms.\n   - **Flupenthixol:** Primarily used as an antipsychotic and sometimes to treat depressive symptoms in dual-action formulations (like flupenthixol decanoate). It is not typically associated with causing depression as a primary side effect.\n\n2. **Analysis of Enhanced Information:**\n   - The enhanced information supports that Flupenthixol does not directly cause depression and may even be used to manage depressive symptoms in certain contexts. This aligns with the general understanding of its use in clinical practice.\n\n3. **Medical Consensus and Final Decision:**\n   - Based on the standard medical knowledge and the enhanced information provided, Flupenthixol does not typically list depression as a direct side effect, unlike the other options listed. While it is an antipsychotic and could have complex effects on mood, its primary association with depression is more about management rather than causation.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nGiven the analysis and the alignment with both standard medical knowledge and the enhanced information, the most likely correct answer is that depression is not a side effect of Flupenthixol.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"After reviewing each medication, it is evident that Propranolol, Oral Contraceptives, and Reserpine have mechanisms that can lead to depression. Flupenthixol, however, is used primarily as an antipsychotic and for managing depressive symptoms in certain formulations, not causing them as a primary side effect. This conclusion is supported by both standard medical knowledge and the enhanced information provided.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}\n```",
