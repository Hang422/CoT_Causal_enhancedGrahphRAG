It is more common with huminsulin\nopb. It may occur in the presence of infections\nopc. It may be due to antibodies to insulin\nopd. Use of glucocorticoids may be useful in severe cases\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nHuminsulin does not cause more common insulin resistance compared to other insulin types. Infections elevate stress hormones, increasing insulin resistance. Antibodies to insulin can reduce its efficacy, thus increasing resistance. Glucocorticoids, contrary to improving severe insulin resistance, actually worsen it by increasing blood glucose levels and impairing insulin action.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "### Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\n1. **Analyzing Each Option:**\n   - **Option opa (It is more common with huminsulin):** Huminsulin is a brand name for human insulin. There is no evidence suggesting that insulin resistance is more common with huminsulin compared to other types of insulin. Insulin resistance generally relates to the body's response to insulin, not the type of insulin used.\n   \n   - **Option opb (It may occur in the presence of infections):** Infections can indeed lead to increased insulin resistance. This occurs because infections raise stress levels and stress hormones (like cortisol), which can impair insulin sensitivity.\n   \n   - **Option opc (It may be due to antibodies to insulin):** In some cases, individuals may develop antibodies against insulin, especially in the context of exogenous insulin administration. These antibodies can interfere with insulin action, leading to increased insulin resistance.\n   \n   - **Option opd (Use of glucocorticoids may be useful in severe cases):** Glucocorticoids are known to increase blood glucose levels and can impair insulin action, thus worsening insulin resistance. They are not typically used to manage insulin resistance and can actually exacerbate the condition.\n\n2. **Identifying the Incorrect Statement:**\n   - Based on the analysis, **Option opd** is the incorrect statement. While glucocorticoids are used in various medical conditions for their anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects, they are not beneficial in the management of insulin resistance; in fact, they are likely to worsen it.\n\n3. **Final Analysis and Confidence Score:**\n   - The medical consensus and evidence clearly indicate that glucocorticoids would not be useful in managing severe cases of insulin resistance due to their glucose-raising effects. This aligns with standard medical knowledge about the impact of glucocorticoids on blood glucose and insulin sensitivity.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"After evaluating each option against standard medical knowledge, it is clear that glucocorticoids, mentioned in option opd, would not be beneficial for managing insulin resistance. This is because they typically raise blood glucose levels and impair insulin action, contrary to what would be desired in managing insulin resistance. The other options are consistent with known medical facts about insulin resistance.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
