Proprioception\nopb. Vibratory sense\nopc. Heat sensation\nopd. Touch\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nHeat sensation is not carried in the dorsal column of the spinal cord, which instead transmits proprioception, vibratory sense, and fine touch. Heat and cold sensations are primarily conveyed via the spinothalamic tract. This distinction is supported by standard neuroanatomical consensus.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "### Core Medical Principle\nThe dorsal column of the spinal cord is responsible for transmitting sensory information related to proprioception, vibratory sense, and fine touch. This pathway is distinct from the spinothalamic tract, which carries information about temperature (heat and cold) and pain.\n\n### Analysis of Options\n- **opa. Proprioception**: This is correctly transmitted via the dorsal column.\n- **opb. Vibratory sense**: This is also correctly transmitted via the dorsal column.\n- **opc. Heat sensation**: Heat sensation is not transmitted via the dorsal column but through the spinothalamic tract.\n- **opd. Touch**: Fine touch is transmitted via the dorsal column, aligning with medical consensus.\n\n### Final Analysis\nBased on the standard neuroanatomical consensus, the dorsal column of the spinal cord does not carry heat sensations. This function is served by the spinothalamic tract. The other options listed (proprioception, vibratory sense, and touch) are indeed functions associated with the dorsal column pathway. Therefore, the correct answer, based on the provided options and supported by medical consensus, is that heat sensation is not carried in the dorsal column.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Heat sensation is transmitted via the spinothalamic tract, not the dorsal column, which carries proprioception, vibratory sense, and fine touch. This aligns with standard neuroanatomical consensus.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opc\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
