Heparin sulfate\nopb. Protamine sulfate\nopc. Low molecular weight heparin\nopd. Warfarin\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nLow molecular weight heparin (LMWH) is the recommended anticoagulant for prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism in patients undergoing cancer surgery. This recommendation is supported by its proven efficacy and safety in cancer patients, as well as its endorsement by clinical guidelines. Evidence paths confirm LMWH's role in effective anticoagulation, particularly in the context of VTE. Other options like heparin sulfate, warfarin, and protamine sulfate are less suitable due to various limitations in efficacy, onset of action, and appropriate usage.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The primary medical principle in selecting an anticoagulant for prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in patients undergoing cancer surgery is to choose an agent that effectively reduces the risk of thrombosis while minimizing potential complications. Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) is widely recommended in clinical guidelines for this purpose, particularly in cancer patients, due to its favorable balance of efficacy, safety, and ease of use. LMWH has been shown to be more effective and safer in cancer patients compared to alternatives like unfractionated heparin or warfarin. Protamine sulfate is not an anticoagulant but a reversal agent for heparin, thus it is not suitable for VTE prophylaxis. Warfarin, while effective for long-term anticoagulation, has a slower onset of action and requires more intensive monitoring, making it less ideal in the immediate postoperative period. Therefore, based on consensus and the enhanced information provided, LMWH is the most appropriate choice for VTE prophylaxis in patients undergoing cancer surgery.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opc\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
