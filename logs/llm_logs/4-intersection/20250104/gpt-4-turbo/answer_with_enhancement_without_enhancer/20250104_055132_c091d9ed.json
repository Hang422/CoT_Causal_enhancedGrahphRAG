Glucocoicoids\nopb. Mineralcoicoids\nopc. Aldosterone\nopd. Androgens\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nThe zona reticularis of the adrenal cortex primarily secretes androgens, which are a type of steroid hormone. This is supported by the evidence path indicating that the zona reticularis is a location of androgen production and that dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), a known androgen, is synthesized in this layer. The other options, glucocorticoids, mineralocorticoids, and aldosterone, are primarily associated with other layers of the adrenal cortex (zona fasciculata and zona glomerulosa). Therefore, the correct answer is androgens, reflecting the specific function of the zona reticularis in hormone synthesis.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The adrenal cortex is divided into three zones, each responsible for producing different types of hormones. The zona glomerulosa primarily produces mineralocorticoids, such as aldosterone. The zona fasciculata mainly secretes glucocorticoids, such as cortisol. The zona reticularis, which is the innermost layer, primarily produces androgens, including dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA). This is well-supported by standard medical knowledge and aligns with the enhanced information provided. The other options, glucocorticoids, mineralocorticoids, and aldosterone, are associated with the other layers of the adrenal cortex, not the zona reticularis. Therefore, based on the consensus and the specific function of the zona reticularis, the correct answer is androgens.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
