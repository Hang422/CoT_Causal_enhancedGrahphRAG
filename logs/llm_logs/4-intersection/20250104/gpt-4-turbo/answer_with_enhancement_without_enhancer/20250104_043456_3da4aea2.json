Retro bulbar neuritis\nopb. Deafness\nopc. Red urine\nopd. Peripheral neuritis\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nEthambutol is known to cause optic neuritis, which may present as retrobulbar neuritis. This is supported by evidence linking Ethambutol with optic nerve issues. Other potential side effects like deafness, red urine, and peripheral neuritis are not supported by substantial evidence or medical consensus.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Ethambutol is an antimicrobial medication primarily used in the treatment of tuberculosis. A well-documented side effect of ethambutol is its impact on the optic nerve, specifically causing optic neuritis. This condition can manifest as retrobulbar neuritis, which involves inflammation of the optic nerve behind the eye, leading to symptoms such as loss of vision and color blindness. The other options listed, such as deafness, red urine, and peripheral neuritis, are not commonly associated with ethambutol based on current medical literature and consensus. Therefore, the most likely correct answer, supported by substantial evidence and medical consensus, is that ethambutol causes retrobulbar neuritis.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
