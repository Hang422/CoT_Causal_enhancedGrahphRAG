Arachidonic acid\nopb. Cholesterol\nopc. Palmitic acid\nopd. Stearic acid\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nArachidonic acid, an unsaturated fatty acid, increases plasma membrane fluidity by being incorporated into phospholipids, enhancing unsaturation. Cholesterol modulates fluidity; it increases at low concentrations but decreases it at high concentrations. Both palmitic and stearic acids, being saturated fats, decrease membrane fluidity. Evidence paths support these roles, emphasizing the impact of fatty acid saturation on membrane properties.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The fluidity of the plasma membrane is influenced by the types of fatty acids present in the phospholipids that make up the membrane. Unsaturated fatty acids, such as arachidonic acid, have one or more double bonds in their hydrocarbon chains, which introduce kinks that prevent the fatty acids from packing tightly together. This results in increased membrane fluidity. Arachidonic acid, being an unsaturated fatty acid, fits this description and thus increases the fluidity of the plasma membrane by being incorporated into phospholipids and enhancing unsaturation. Cholesterol also plays a role in modulating membrane fluidity, but its effect is concentration-dependent, making it a less straightforward choice. Both palmitic and stearic acids are saturated fats and would decrease membrane fluidity by allowing the fatty acid chains to pack more closely. Based on the consensus in physiological understanding of membrane dynamics, arachidonic acid is the most likely correct answer.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}",
