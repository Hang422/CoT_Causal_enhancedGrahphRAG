Anti depressants\nopb. Anti psychotics\nopc. Anti epileptics\nopd. Mood stabilizers\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nSchizophrenia is primarily treated with antipsychotic medications, which effectively address the core psychotic symptoms by targeting neurotransmitter imbalances, particularly through blocking dopamine receptors. While antidepressants, mood stabilizers, and antiepileptics may be used to manage co-occurring symptoms in schizophrenia patients, they do not constitute primary treatments for the disorder itself.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Schizophrenia is a psychiatric disorder characterized by symptoms such as hallucinations, delusions, disorganized thinking, and cognitive impairments. The primary treatment for schizophrenia involves the use of antipsychotic medications. These medications primarily function by modulating neurotransmitter systems, especially dopamine, to alleviate psychotic symptoms. While other medications like antidepressants, mood stabilizers, and antiepileptics can be used to address co-occurring symptoms or specific symptom domains in schizophrenia, they are not the primary treatment for the core psychotic features of the disorder. Therefore, based on standard medical knowledge and consensus, antipsychotics are the most appropriate and direct treatment for managing schizophrenia.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
