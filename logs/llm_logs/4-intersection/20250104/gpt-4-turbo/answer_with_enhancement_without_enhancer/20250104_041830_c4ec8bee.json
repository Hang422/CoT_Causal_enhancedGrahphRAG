Ca transporter\nopb. Cu transporter\nopc. Zn transporter\nopd. Se transporter\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nMenkes Kinky Hair Syndrome is caused by a defect in the ATP7A gene, leading to impaired copper transport. This genetic defect results in a range of symptoms including brittle, kinky hair, connective tissue abnormalities, neurological issues, and developmental delays, all linked to copper utilization dysfunction. The evidence supports that this syndrome is a hereditary disease associated with copper-related physiological functions, confirming the defect in the Cu transporter as the underlying cause.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Menkes Kinky Hair Syndrome is a genetic disorder characterized by a defect in copper transport, specifically due to mutations in the ATP7A gene. This gene encodes a protein that is essential for the proper transport of copper in the body. The dysfunction in copper transport leads to various symptoms including brittle, kinky hair, as well as neurological and developmental issues. The information provided aligns with the standard medical understanding of the syndrome, confirming that the defect is indeed in the Cu transporter. Therefore, the correct answer is based on a well-established medical consensus.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
