  "response": "### Enhanced Information Summary\n\nThe question requires selecting a drug that inhibits both basal and stimulated gastric acid secretion without affecting cholinergic, histaminergic, or gastrin receptors. \n\n1. **Omeprazole** is a proton pump inhibitor that blocks the H+/K+ ATPase enzyme in the stomach lining. This action reduces both basal and stimulated gastric acid secretion, aligning with the requirements of the question. The evidence path confirming Omeprazole as a proton pump inhibitor supports this reasoning, as proton pump inhibitors are known to inhibit gastric acid secretion at the final step of acid production, which is effective regardless of the stimulus.\n\n2. **Loxatidine** and **Famotidine** are both H2 receptor antagonists. They primarily block the action of histamine on H2 receptors, which predominantly affects stimulated gastric acid secretion. They are less effective in reducing basal gastric acid secretion. Thus, neither fully meets the criteria specified in the question.\n\n3. **Pirenzepine** is an M1 muscarinic receptor antagonist. It primarily blocks the acetylcholine effect on gastric cells, which more significantly affects basal acid secretion than stimulated secretion. This does not fully align with the requirement to block both types of secretion effectively.\n\nGiven the analysis and the evidence paths provided, **Omeprazole** is the only drug among the options that effectively blocks both basal and stimulated gastric acid secretion without targeting cholinergic, histaminergic, or gastrin receptors directly. The evidence paths related to its classification as a proton pump inhibitor and its interaction with the CYP2C19 gene further confirm its mechanism of action and its broad effectiveness in reducing gastric acid secretion.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Omeprazole, a proton pump inhibitor, effectively blocks both basal and stimulated gastric acid secretion by inhibiting the H+/K+ ATPase enzyme in the stomach lining.

Evidence paths confirm its classification and broad effectiveness in gastric acid reduction.\"\n}\n```",
