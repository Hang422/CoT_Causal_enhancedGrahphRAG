      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Physiology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        True regarding respiratory centre\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Directly simulated by fall in PaO2\nopb. Connected with cardiac center\nopc. Inhibited during swallowing\nopd. Situated in midbrain\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Respiratory centre\" -> \"located in the medulla oblongata and pons\" -> \"not situated in midbrain\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Respiratory centre\" -> \"receives signals from chemoreceptors\" -> \"chemoreceptors respond to CO2 levels primarily\" -> \"PaO2 has less direct effect\" -> \"not directly stimulated by fall in PaO2\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Respiratory centre\" -> \"closely linked to autonomic nervous system\" -> \"autonomic nervous system controls both respiratory and cardiac functions\" -> \"connected with cardiac center\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Swallowing\" -> \"activates swallowing center in the medulla\" -> \"temporarily inhibits respiratory center to prevent aspiration\" -> \"inhibited during swallowing\" -> 95%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Medulla Oblongata)-PART_OF->(Midbrain structure)\n(Pontine structure)-PART_OF->(Midbrain structure)\n(Chemoreceptors)-PART_OF->(Muscle)-LOCATION_OF->(PO2 measurement)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "### Enhanced Information Summary\n\n1. **Respiratory Centre Location**: The respiratory centre is located in the medulla oblongata and pons, not in the midbrain. This corrects the chain for option D, which mistakenly suggests the respiratory centre is situated in the midbrain. The evidence paths mentioning the medulla oblongata and pons as part of the midbrain structure are misleading in this context, as they refer to broader anatomical classifications rather than specific functional locations.\n\n2. **Stimulation by PaO2**: The respiratory centre is primarily responsive to changes in CO2 levels, not directly to falls in PaO2. Chemoreceptors, which influence the respiratory centre, are more sensitive to CO2 levels. This aligns with the chain for option A, confirming that the respiratory centre is not directly stimulated by a fall in PaO2. The evidence path linking chemoreceptors with PO2 measurement in muscles does not directly support this point but confirms the role of chemoreceptors in sensing gas levels.\n\n3. **Connection with Cardiac Center**: The respiratory centre is linked to the autonomic nervous system, which also controls cardiac functions, indicating a connection between the respiratory and cardiac centers. This supports the chain for option B and aligns with standard physiological understanding of the integrated control of vital functions.\n\n4. **Inhibition During Swallowing**: During swallowing, the respiratory centre is temporarily inhibited by the swallowing center in the medulla to prevent aspiration. This is a protective reflex and is well-supported by the chain for option C, aligning with standard physiological knowledge about the coordination of swallowing and respiration.\n\nIn conclusion, the respiratory centre is not situated in the midbrain (option D is incorrect), is not directly stimulated by a fall in PaO2 (option A is incorrect), is connected with the cardiac center (option B is correct), and is inhibited during swallowing (option C is correct). The evidence paths provided broad anatomical and functional context but were most useful in confirming the role of chemoreceptors and the general anatomical location of the respiratory centre.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"The respiratory centre, located in the medulla oblongata and pons, is primarily responsive to CO2 levels and not directly stimulated by falls in PaO2.
