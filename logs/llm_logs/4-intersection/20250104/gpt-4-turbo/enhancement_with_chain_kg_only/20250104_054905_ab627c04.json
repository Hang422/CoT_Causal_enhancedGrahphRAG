      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Which is an uricosuric drug-\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Allopurinol\nopb. Probenecid\nopc. Indomethacin\nopd. Aspirin\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Probenecid\" -> \"increases excretion of uric acid\" -> \"uricosuric drug\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Allopurinol\" -> \"inhibits xanthine oxidase\" -> \"reduces uric acid production\" -> \"not primarily uricosuric\" -> 80%\nCHAIN: \"Indomethacin\" -> \"nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug\" -> \"used for pain and inflammation\" -> \"not uricosuric\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Aspirin\" -> \"low doses decrease uric acid excretion\" -> \"high doses weakly uricosuric\" -> \"not primarily used as uricosuric\" -> 70%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Probenecid)-TREATS->(Disease)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Excretory function)\n(Probenecid)-TREATS->(Gout)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Excretory function)\n(Allopurinol)-PREVENTS/TREATS->(Ischemia)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Xanthine Oxidase)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Probenecid is the correct answer as it is a uricosuric drug, which means it increases the excretion of uric acid, a key factor in the treatment of gout. This is supported by evidence paths linking Probenecid to the treatment of gout and its impact on excretory function. Allopurinol, while it treats conditions related to uric acid, does so by inhibiting xanthine oxidase and reducing uric acid production, not by increasing its excretion, thus it is not primarily uricosuric. Indomethacin and Aspirin, although having roles in pain and inflammation management, do not primarily function as uricosuric drugs. Aspirin at high doses can be weakly uricosuric, but it is not used primarily for this purpose.\"\n}",
