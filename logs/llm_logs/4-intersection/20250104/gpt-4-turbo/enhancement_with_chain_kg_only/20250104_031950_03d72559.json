      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        The following drugs have significant drug interactions with digoxin except:\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Cholestyramine\nopb. Thiazide diuretics\nopc. Quinidine\nopd. Amlodipine\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Cholestyramine\" -> \"binds bile acids in the intestine\" -> \"does not directly affect serum digoxin levels\" -> \"no significant interaction with digoxin\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Thiazide diuretics\" -> \"cause hypokalemia\" -> \"increased risk of digoxin toxicity due to low potassium levels\" -> \"significant interaction with digoxin\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Quinidine\" -> \"increases serum digoxin concentration\" -> \"increases risk of digoxin toxicity\" -> \"significant interaction with digoxin\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Amlodipine\" -> \"calcium channel blocker\" -> \"possible mild increase in digoxin levels\" -> \"less significant but potential interaction with digoxin\" -> 75%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Amlodipine)-ISA->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Calcium Channel Blockers)\n(Calcium Channel Blockers)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Digoxin)\n(Cholestyramine)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Enzymes)-PART_OF->(Intestines)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Cholestyramine, a bile acid sequestrant, binds bile acids in the intestine but does not directly affect serum digoxin levels, indicating no significant interaction with digoxin. Thiazide diuretics can cause hypokalemia, which increases the risk of digoxin toxicity due to low potassium levels, thus presenting a significant interaction with digoxin. Quinidine is known to increase serum digoxin concentration, thereby increasing the risk of digoxin toxicity, confirming a significant interaction. Amlodipine, a calcium channel blocker, may cause a mild increase in digoxin levels; however, this interaction is generally considered less significant compared to others like quinidine or thiazide diuretics. The evidence paths confirm interactions between calcium channel blockers and digoxin, supporting the potential, albeit minor, interaction with amlodipine. Therefore, the drug with the least significant interaction with digoxin is Cholestyramine.\"\n}",
