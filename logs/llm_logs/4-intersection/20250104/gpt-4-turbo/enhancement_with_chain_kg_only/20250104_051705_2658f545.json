      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Biochemistry.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Inherited hyperammonemia is a result of deficiency of which enzyme of Krebs-Henseleit urea cycle?\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Malate dehydrogenase\nopb. Isocitrate dehydrogenase\nopc. N-acetyl glutamate synthetase\nopd. Succinate dehydrogenase\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"N-acetyl glutamate synthetase\" -> \"deficiency leads to decreased production of N-acetylglutamate\" -> \"reduced activation of carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I\" -> \"decreased urea cycle function\" -> \"increased ammonia levels\" -> \"hyperammonemia\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Malate dehydrogenase\" -> \"involved in the citric acid cycle, not urea cycle\" -> \"deficiency does not directly lead to hyperammonemia\" -> \"no direct link to inherited hyperammonemia\" -> 10%\nCHAIN: \"Isocitrate dehydrogenase\" -> \"part of the citric acid cycle, not urea cycle\" -> \"deficiency does not directly lead to hyperammonemia\" -> \"no direct link to inherited hyperammonemia\" -> 10%\nCHAIN: \"Succinate dehydrogenase\" -> \"involved in the citric acid cycle, not urea cycle\" -> \"deficiency does not directly lead to hyperammonemia\" -> \"no direct link to inherited hyperammonemia\" -> 10%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Ammonia level finding)-PREDISPOSES->(Septicemia)-CAUSES->(Hyperammonemia)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Inherited hyperammonemia is often caused by deficiencies in enzymes involved in the urea cycle, which is crucial for the detoxification of ammonia in the liver. Among the options provided, N-acetyl glutamate synthetase is the only enzyme directly involved in the urea cycle. Deficiency in N-acetyl glutamate synthetase leads to decreased production of N-acetylglutamate, an essential activator of carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I, thereby reducing urea cycle function and resulting in increased ammonia levels, or hyperammonemia. The other enzymes listed - Malate dehydrogenase, Isocitrate dehydrogenase, and Succinate dehydrogenase - are part of the citric acid cycle, not the urea cycle, and their deficiencies do not directly lead to hyperammonemia. The retrieved evidence path regarding septicemia causing hyperammonemia is not directly relevant to the question of enzyme deficiencies in the urea cycle and thus does not aid in answering this specific question.\"\n}",
