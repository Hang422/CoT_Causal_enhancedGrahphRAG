      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Biochemistry.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Which of the following vitamin reduces the risk of insulin resistance, obesity, and the metabolic syndrome?\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Vitamin A\nopb. Vitamin C\nopc. Vitamin D\nopd. Vitamin B12\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Vitamin A\" -> \"regulates gene expression\" -> \"influences fat cell development\" -> \"possible reduction in obesity\" -> 60%\nCHAIN: \"Vitamin C\" -> \"antioxidant properties\" -> \"reduces oxidative stress\" -> \"may improve insulin sensitivity\" -> \"possible reduction in metabolic syndrome\" -> 65%\nCHAIN: \"Vitamin D\" -> \"improves calcium metabolism\" -> \"enhances insulin sensitivity\" -> \"reduces risk of insulin resistance\" -> \"lowers risk of obesity and metabolic syndrome\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Vitamin B12\" -> \"important for nerve function\" -> \"aids in metabolism of fats and carbohydrates\" -> \"unclear direct effect on insulin resistance or obesity\" -> 50%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Fatty acid glycerol esters)-CAUSES/TREATS->(Obesity)\n(insulin sensitivity)-PREDISPOSES->(Metabolic Syndrome X)\n(Insulin Resistance)-CAUSES/PREDISPOSES->(Metabolic Syndrome X)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Among the vitamins listed, Vitamin D is the most supported by consensus for reducing the risk of insulin resistance, obesity, and metabolic syndrome. Vitamin D enhances insulin sensitivity, which is crucial in managing and preventing insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome, as supported by the evidence path linking insulin sensitivity to predisposing metabolic syndrome. Vitamin A's role in fat cell development and Vitamin C's antioxidant properties, while beneficial for general health, have less direct and robust evidence linking them to significant reductions in obesity or metabolic syndrome. Vitamin B12, important for nerve function and metabolism, does not have a direct established link to reducing insulin resistance or obesity. Therefore, Vitamin D stands out as the most effective in this context based on its direct impact on enhancing insulin sensitivity and reducing associated risks.\"\n}",
