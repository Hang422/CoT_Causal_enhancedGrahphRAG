      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Biochemistry.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Which of the following fat soluble vitamin has been  identified to function as a coenzyme?\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Vitamin A\nopb. Vitamin K\nopc. Vitamin E\nopd. Vitamin D\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Vitamin A\" -> \"functions in vision, immune function, and cell growth\" -> \"not primarily a coenzyme\" -> 10%\nCHAIN: \"Vitamin K\" -> \"functions in blood clotting and bone metabolism\" -> \"acts as a coenzyme in the carboxylation of glutamic acid residues\" -> \"identified as a coenzyme\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Vitamin E\" -> \"functions as an antioxidant\" -> \"protects cell membranes from oxidation\" -> \"not identified as a coenzyme\" -> 10%\nCHAIN: \"Vitamin D\" -> \"regulates calcium and phosphate metabolism\" -> \"promotes bone and immune health\" -> \"not identified as a coenzyme\" -> 10%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Vitamin D2)-INTERACTS_WITH->(calcium)\n(Vitamin E)-INTERACTS_WITH/ISA->(Antioxidants)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Among the options provided, Vitamin K is the only fat-soluble vitamin that functions as a coenzyme. It plays a crucial role in the carboxylation of glutamic acid residues, a process essential for blood clotting and bone metabolism. The other vitamins listed, Vitamin A, Vitamin E, and Vitamin D, do not function as coenzymes. Vitamin A is primarily involved in vision, immune function, and cell growth. Vitamin E acts as an antioxidant, protecting cell membranes from oxidation, and Vitamin D regulates calcium and phosphate metabolism and promotes bone and immune health. The evidence paths provided for Vitamin D and Vitamin E, such as interactions with calcium and classification as an antioxidant, respectively, do not alter the fact that they are not identified as coenzymes.\"\n}",
