  "response": "### Enhanced Information Summary\n\nCardiac muscle is characterized by several distinct features that differentiate it from other muscle types. Here's a breakdown of the options provided, aligned with medical consensus and supported by relevant evidence:\n\n1. **Striated**: Cardiac muscle is indeed striated, similar to skeletal muscle, due to the organized arrangement of actin and myosin filaments. This feature is well-established in medical literature and matches option A.\n\n2. **Large T tubules**: The assertion in option B that cardiac muscle has large T tubules is incorrect. In fact, T tubules in cardiac muscle are smaller and more densely packed compared to those in skeletal muscle. This is a critical point of distinction and conflicts with option B.\n\n3. **Troponin system present**: Cardiac muscle uses the troponin system for calcium-mediated regulation of contraction, which is a key mechanism in its functionality. This matches option C and is supported by evidence linking troponin to cardiac functions in conditions like atrial fibrillation and left ventricular systolic dysfunction.\n\n4. **Caldesmon as an important regulatory protein**: Caldesmon is not a regulatory protein in cardiac muscle; it is more relevant in smooth muscle. This is confirmed by evidence showing caldesmon interactions primarily within smooth muscle tissues. This conflicts with option D, indicating that caldesmon is not a feature of cardiac muscle.\n\nIn conclusion, the correct answer to the question \"All the following are features of Cardiac muscle Except\" is option D, as caldesmon is not an important regulatory protein in cardiac muscle. This conclusion is supported by both the standard medical consensus and specific evidence paths linking caldesmon to smooth muscle rather than cardiac muscle.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Cardiac muscle is striated and uses the troponin system for contraction, but unlike skeletal muscle, it has smaller T tubules. Caldesmon, important in smooth muscle, is not a regulatory protein in cardiac muscle. Thus, option D (Caldesmon is an important regulatory protein) is the correct answer as it does not describe a feature of cardiac muscle.\"\n}\n```",
