      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        If a fibrinolytic drug is used for the treatment of acute myocardial infarction, the adverse effect most likely to occur is:\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Acute renal failure\nopb. Development of antiplatelet antibodies\nopc. Encephalitis secondary to liver dysfunction\nopd. Hemorrhagic stroke\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Fibrinolytic drug administration\" -> \"breakdown of blood clots\" -> \"increased risk of bleeding\" -> \"hemorrhagic stroke\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Fibrinolytic drug administration\" -> \"breakdown of blood clots\" -> \"disruption of normal clotting mechanisms\" -> \"possible bleeding in other areas\" -> \"unclear if leads to acute renal failure\" -> 30%\nCHAIN: \"Fibrinolytic drug administration\" -> \"alteration of platelet function\" -> \"possible development of antiplatelet antibodies\" -> \"unclear evidence of this outcome\" -> 25%\nCHAIN: \"Fibrinolytic drug administration\" -> \"metabolic changes\" -> \"possible liver dysfunction\" -> \"unclear if leads to encephalitis\" -> 20%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Hemorrhage)-CAUSES/MANIFESTATION_OF->(Disease)-PREDISPOSES->(Hemorrhagic Stroke)\n(Hemorrhage)-CAUSES/PREDISPOSES->(Kidney Failure, Acute)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"The use of fibrinolytic drugs in the treatment of acute myocardial infarction primarily increases the risk of bleeding due to the breakdown of blood clots. This heightened risk of bleeding is most significantly associated with the potential for a hemorrhagic stroke. The reasoning chain for hemorrhagic stroke aligns well with medical consensus, which recognizes that the systemic action of fibrinolytics on clot dissolution can inadvertently affect vessels in the brain, leading to hemorrhage. The evidence path linking hemorrhage as a cause or manifestation of disease that predisposes to hemorrhagic stroke supports this connection. Other options such as acute renal failure, development of antiplatelet antibodies, and encephalitis secondary to liver dysfunction are less directly associated with the use of fibrinolytics and lack strong evidence or clear mechanistic pathways linking them to the administration of these drugs in the context of myocardial infarction.\"\n}",
