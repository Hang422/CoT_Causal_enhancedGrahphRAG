      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Physiology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Which of the following peptides are not produced by the renal system?\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Renin\nopb. Angiotensin I\nopc. Erythropoietin\nopd. 1,25DHCC\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Renin\" -> \"produced by juxtaglomerular cells in kidneys\" -> 0%\nCHAIN: \"Angiotensin I\" -> \"formed from angiotensinogen by renin\" -> \"renin produced by kidneys\" -> 0%\nCHAIN: \"Erythropoietin\" -> \"produced by kidneys in response to hypoxia\" -> 0%\nCHAIN: \"1,25DHCC\" -> \"active form of vitamin D\" -> \"synthesized in kidneys from 25-hydroxyvitamin D\" -> 0%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Angiotensin I)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Endothelial Cells)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cells)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Renin)\n(Angiotensin I)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Myocytes, Smooth Muscle)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Hematopoietic stem cells)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Renin)\n(Renin)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cells)-PART_OF->(Kidney)\n(Renin)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Lymphocyte)-PART_OF->(Kidney)\n(Erythropoietin)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Lymphocyte)-PART_OF->(Kidney)\n(Erythropoietin)-INTERACTS_WITH->(MONONUCLEAR CELLS)-PART_OF->(Kidney)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Among the listed peptides, Angiotensin I is not directly produced by the renal system. Renin, which is indeed produced by the juxtaglomerular cells of the kidneys, acts on angiotensinogen (produced by the liver) to form Angiotensin I. Therefore, while Renin is a renal product, Angiotensin I itself is a result of this renal enzyme's action on a liver-derived substrate, not a direct renal product. Erythropoietin is produced by the kidneys in response to hypoxia, and 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol (1,25DHCC), the active form of vitamin D, is synthesized in the kidneys from 25-hydroxyvitamin D. The evidence paths provided confirm the renal origin of Renin and Erythropoietin but do not directly address the synthesis locations of Angiotensin I and 1,25DHCC, reinforcing that only Angiotensin I among the options is not produced by the renal system.\"\n}",
