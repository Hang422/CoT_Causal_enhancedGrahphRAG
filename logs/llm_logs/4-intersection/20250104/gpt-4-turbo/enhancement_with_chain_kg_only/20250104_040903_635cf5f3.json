      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        A person on anti-tubercular drugs complained of deafness and tinnitus in one ear. Drug implicated is?\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Streptomycin\nopb. Isoniazid\nopc. Ethambutol\nopd. Rifampicin\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Streptomycin\" -> \"aminoglycoside antibiotic\" -> \"ototoxic effects\" -> \"damage to auditory nerve\" -> \"deafness and tinnitus\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Isoniazid\" -> \"antibacterial used for tuberculosis\" -> \"known for causing peripheral neuropathy\" -> \"less commonly affects auditory nerve\" -> \"possible deafness and tinnitus\" -> 60%\nCHAIN: \"Ethambutol\" -> \"antitubercular drug\" -> \"more commonly causes visual disturbances\" -> \"rarely linked to auditory issues\" -> \"unlikely cause of deafness and tinnitus\" -> 30%\nCHAIN: \"Rifampicin\" -> \"broad-spectrum antibiotic\" -> \"used in tuberculosis treatment\" -> \"not typically associated with ototoxicity\" -> \"unlikely cause of deafness and tinnitus\" -> 20%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Streptomycin)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Disease)-PROCESS_OF->(Actinobacteria class)-LOCATION_OF->(Antibiotics, Aminoglycoside)\n(Streptomycin)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Disease)-PROCESS_OF->(Salmonella typhimurium)-LOCATION_OF->(Antibiotics, Aminoglycoside)\n(isoniazid)-CAUSES/TREATS->(Tuberculosis)\n(Acoustic Nerve)-LOCATION_OF->(Tinnitus)\n(Ethambutol)-TREATS->(Mycobacterium tuberculosis)-LOCATION_OF->(Antitubercular Agents)\n(Ototoxicity)-CAUSES->(Tinnitus)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "### Enhanced Information Analysis:\n\n#### Streptomycin:\n- **Chain Analysis**: The chain correctly identifies Streptomycin as an aminoglycoside antibiotic known for its ototoxic effects, which can damage the auditory nerve leading to deafness and tinnitus. This aligns well with medical consensus.\n- **Evidence Path Relevance**: The path linking Streptomycin with ototoxicity through its classification as an aminoglycoside antibiotic supports the chain's claim. The path mentioning diseases and bacteria classes is too broad and not directly relevant to the specific side effect of ototoxicity.\n\n#### Isoniazid:\n- **Chain Analysis**: Isoniazid is indeed an antibacterial used for tuberculosis and is known for causing peripheral neuropathy. However, its association with auditory nerve damage leading to deafness and tinnitus is not strongly supported by medical consensus, as it more commonly affects other types of nerves.\n- **Evidence Path Relevance**: The path simply confirms Isoniazid's role in treating tuberculosis, which does not directly support the claim of causing deafness and tinnitus.\n\n#### Ethambutol:\n- **Chain Analysis**: Ethambutol is correctly identified as causing primarily visual disturbances and is rarely linked to auditory issues. This makes it an unlikely cause of deafness and tinnitus, aligning with medical consensus.\n- **Evidence Path Relevance**: The path confirms Ethambutol's role in treating Mycobacterium tuberculosis but does not provide information on auditory side effects, which is consistent with the chain's conclusion.\n\n#### Rifampicin:\n- **Chain Analysis**: Rifampicin is a broad-spectrum antibiotic used in tuberculosis treatment and is not typically associated with ototoxicity. This makes it an unlikely cause of deafness and tinnitus, which is consistent with medical consensus.\n- **Evidence Path Relevance**: There is no specific path provided that links Rifampicin directly to ototoxic effects, supporting the chain's conclusion.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe most likely drug implicated in causing deafness and tinnitus in a patient on anti-tubercular drugs is **Streptomycin**. This conclusion is strongly supported by both the reasoning chain and the relevant evidence path that associates Streptomycin with ototoxic effects, a known side effect of aminoglycoside antibiotics. Other drugs listed either have a lower probability of causing these specific symptoms or are associated with different types of side effects.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Streptomycin, an aminoglycoside antibiotic, is known for its ototoxic effects, which can damage the auditory nerve leading to deafness and tinnitus. This aligns with medical consensus and is supported by evidence linking Streptomycin with ototoxicity. Other anti-tubercular drugs like Isoniazid, Ethambutol, and Rifampicin are less likely to cause these auditory side effects.\"\n}\n```",
