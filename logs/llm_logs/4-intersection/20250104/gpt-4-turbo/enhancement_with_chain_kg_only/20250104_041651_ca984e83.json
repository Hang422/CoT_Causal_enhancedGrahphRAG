Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Levamisole is used as all except -\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Single dose in ascariasis\nopb. Immunostimulant\nopc. Paralysis of worms by depolarisation\nopd. Immunodepressant in high doses\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Levamisole\" -> \"used as an anthelmintic\" -> \"effective in single doses for ascariasis\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Levamisole\" -> \"acts as an immunomodulator\" -> \"functions as an immunostimulant\" -> 98%\nCHAIN: \"Levamisole\" -> \"causes hyperpolarization of worm muscle membrane\" -> \"leads to paralysis of worms\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Levamisole\" -> \"used in low doses primarily\" -> \"immunodepressant effects at high doses unclear\" -> 70%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Levamisole)-TREATS->(Disease)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Immunity)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Immunologic Adjuvants)\n(Levamisole)-TREATS->(Disease)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Antiinflammatory Effect)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Immunologic Adjuvants)\n(Anthelmintics)-PREVENTS/TREATS->(Ascariasis)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "### Enhanced Information Summary\n\nLevamisole is primarily recognized for its use as an anthelmintic agent, particularly effective in treating ascariasis, often in single doses. This aligns with the retrieved evidence path linking anthelmintics to the treatment of ascariasis, confirming the accuracy of the reasoning chain for option A.\n\nAs an immunomodulator, Levamisole acts as an immunostimulant, which is well-documented and supported by the broad evidence path associating Levamisole with immunologic adjuvants. This supports the reasoning chain for option B, confirming its role in enhancing immune responses.\n\nRegarding the mechanism of action against parasitic worms, Levamisole acts by causing hyperpolarization, not depolarization, of the worm muscle membrane, leading to paralysis. This contradicts the reasoning chain in option C, which incorrectly states depolarization. The correct action is hyperpolarization, which is a critical distinction in understanding its anthelmintic mechanism.\n\nThe claim of Levamisole acting as an immunodepressant at high doses (option D) is not well-supported by robust clinical evidence or consensus. The reasoning chain suggests uncertainty about this effect, and the broad evidence paths do not provide clarity on this specific point, making it the least substantiated claim among the options.\n\nBased on the corrected and verified information, the best consensus-supported interpretation is that Levamisole is used as all except an immunodepressant in high doses (option D), as this claim lacks sufficient evidence and consensus support.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Levamisole is effectively used as an anthelmintic for ascariasis and acts as an immunostimulant. It paralyzes worms through hyperpolarization of their muscle membranes. There is insufficient evidence to support its use as an immunodepressant at high doses, making this the correct answer to the question of what Levamisole is not used for.\"\n}\n```",
