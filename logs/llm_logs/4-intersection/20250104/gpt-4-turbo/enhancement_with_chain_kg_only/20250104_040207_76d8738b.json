      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Biochemistry.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4.

None of the above\nopb. Albumin\nopc. Globulins\nopd. Chylomicrons\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Free fatty acids\" -> \"released into the bloodstream\" -> \"bound by albumin for transport\" -> \"transported to mitochondria for oxidation\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Free fatty acids\" -> \"need transport molecules in blood\" -> \"albumin acts as a carrier for fatty acids\" -> \"fatty acids reach mitochondria\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Chylomicrons\" -> \"transport dietary lipids from intestines\" -> \"not primarily for transporting free fatty acids to mitochondria\" -> \"less likely to be involved in this context\" -> 70%\nCHAIN: \"Globulins\" -> \"function mainly in immune response\" -> \"not involved in fatty acid transport\" -> \"unlikely to transport free fatty acids to mitochondria\" -> 60%\nCHAIN: \"None of the above\" -> \"implies no correct carrier listed\" -> \"incorrect because albumin is a known carrier\" -> \"not applicable in this scenario\" -> 10%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Albumins)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Hormones)-PART_OF->(Protoplasm)-LOCATION_OF->(Oxidation)\n(Albumins)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cells)-LOCATION_OF->(Membrane)-LOCATION_OF->(Oxidation)\n(Albumins)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cells)-LOCATION_OF->(Fatty Acids)\n(Albumins)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Lymphocyte)-LOCATION_OF->(Fatty Acids)\n(Release procedure)-PREVENTS->(Complication)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Albumins)\n(Release procedure)-TREATS->(Functional disorder)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Albumins)\n(Blood Circulation)-PROCESS_OF->(Organ)-LOCATION_OF->(Albumins)\n(Blood Circulation)-PROCESS_OF->(Entire tibia)-LOCATION_OF->(Albumins)\n(Blood)-PART_OF->(Liver)-LOCATION_OF->(Albumins)\n(Blood)-PART_OF->(Brain)-LOCATION_OF->(Albumins)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2.

  "response": "### Enhanced Information Summary\n\nFree fatty acids (FFAs) require transport mechanisms to move through the bloodstream to the mitochondria, where they undergo oxidation. The primary transporter of FFAs in the blood is albumin. Albumin binds these acids and facilitates their transport to various tissues, including the liver and muscle cells, where they can be oxidized for energy.\n\nThe evidence paths confirm the role of albumin in interacting with cells and fatty acids, which supports its function in transporting FFAs to the mitochondria. Specifically, the path \"(Albumins)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cells)-LOCATION_OF->(Fatty Acids)\" directly aligns with the consensus that albumin plays a crucial role in the transport of fatty acids in the bloodstream.\n\nOther options such as chylomicrons, globulins, and \"none of the above\" are less relevant or incorrect in this context:\n- Chylomicrons primarily transport dietary lipids from the intestines and are not the main carriers for FFAs to mitochondria.\n- Globulins mainly function in the immune response and do not have a role in transporting FFAs.\n- \"None of the above\" is incorrect as albumin is a well-established carrier for FFAs.\n\nThus, the correct answer, supported by both the reasoning chains and evidence paths, is that albumin is responsible for the transport of free fatty acids to the mitochondria for oxidation.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Free fatty acids are transported to the mitochondria for oxidation primarily by albumin. Albumin binds these acids in the bloodstream, facilitating their transport to tissues where they can be utilized for energy. This role is supported by evidence paths showing albumin's interaction with cells and fatty acids. Other options such as chylomicrons, globulins, and 'none of the above' do not correctly describe the transport mechanism for FFAs to mitochondria.\"\n}\n```",
