  "response": "### Enhanced Information Summary\n\nThe question asks to identify which of the listed options is not an enzymatic marker of the plasma membrane. \n\n1. **5'-nucleotidase** is indeed a marker of the plasma membrane, involved in the hydrolysis of nucleotide monophosphates. This enzyme is commonly used as a marker for plasma membrane in various cell types.\n\n2. **Adenylyl cyclase** is also a marker of the plasma membrane. It catalyzes the conversion of ATP to cyclic AMP and is integral to signal transduction pathways. The evidence paths provided confirm its association with the cell membrane through interactions with cyclic AMP and phosphatidic acid, both of which are components or linked to the cell membrane.\n\n3. **Na+-K+-ATPase** is a well-known plasma membrane marker, crucial for maintaining the electrochemical gradient across the plasma membrane by pumping sodium out of and potassium into the cell.\n\n4. **Galactosyl transferase**, however, is primarily associated with the Golgi apparatus, not the plasma membrane. It functions in the Golgi to catalyze the transfer of galactose from UDP-galactose to acceptor molecules, playing a key role in glycosylation processes. The reasoning chain correctly identifies it as not a marker of the plasma membrane, aligning with standard biochemical consensus.\n\nIn conclusion, the enzymatic marker not associated with the plasma membrane among the options given is **Galactosyl transferase**. The evidence paths provided for Adenylyl cyclase reinforce its role in the plasma membrane, supporting the exclusion of Galactosyl transferase as a plasma membrane marker.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Among the options provided, 5'-nucleotidase, Adenylyl cyclase, and Na+-K+-ATPase are confirmed enzymatic markers of the plasma membrane, supported by their biochemical roles and interactions.
