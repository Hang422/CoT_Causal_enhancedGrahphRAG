      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Biochemistry.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Menke's Kinky hair syndrome is due to defect in\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Ca transporter\nopb. Cu transporter\nopc. Zn transporter\nopd. Se transporter\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Menke's Kinky Hair Syndrome\" -> \"genetic disorder\" -> \"defect in ATP7A gene\" -> \"impaired copper transport\" -> \"Cu transporter defect\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Menke's Kinky Hair Syndrome\" -> \"connective tissue abnormalities\" -> \"neurological issues\" -> \"caused by copper imbalance\" -> \"Cu transporter defect\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Menke's Kinky Hair Syndrome\" -> \"mutation in gene related to metal transport\" -> \"ATP7A gene affects copper levels\" -> \"Cu transporter defect\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Menke's Kinky Hair Syndrome\" -> \"characteristic brittle, kinky hair\" -> \"result of copper deficiency\" -> \"Cu transporter defect\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Menke's Kinky Hair Syndrome\" -> \"developmental delays\" -> \"linked to copper utilization in body\" -> \"Cu transporter defect\" -> 95%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Menkes Kinky Hair Syndrome)-CAUSES->(Symptoms)-PREDISPOSES->(Developmental delay (disorder))\n(Menkes Kinky Hair Syndrome)-ISA->(Hereditary Diseases)\n(Menkes Kinky Hair Syndrome)-ISA->(Complication)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Genes)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Menke's Kinky Hair Syndrome is a genetic disorder caused by a defect in the ATP7A gene, which is crucial for copper transport. This defect leads to impaired copper transport, resulting in a copper transporter defect. The syndrome is characterized by symptoms such as brittle, kinky hair, connective tissue abnormalities, neurological issues, and developmental delays, all of which are linked to copper imbalance in the body. The evidence paths confirm Menke's Kinky Hair Syndrome as a hereditary disease associated with genes and complications, supporting the genetic basis and the involvement of copper transport in the disorder.\"\n}",
