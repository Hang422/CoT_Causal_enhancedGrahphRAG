Increases liver glycogenolysis\nopb. Causes broachiolar constriction\nopc. Evokes extrasystoles in the heart\nopd. Produces restlessness and anxiety\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"High dose of epinephrine\" -> \"activates beta-2 adrenergic receptors\" -> \"causes bronchiolar relaxation\" -> \"opposite of bronchiolar constriction\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"High dose of epinephrine\" -> \"increases cyclic AMP in liver cells\" -> \"activates glycogen phosphorylase\" -> \"increases liver glycogenolysis\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"High dose of epinephrine\" -> \"stimulates beta-1 adrenergic receptors in the heart\" -> \"increases heart rate and force of contraction\" -> \"can lead to extrasystoles\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"High dose of epinephrine\" -> \"stimulates central nervous system\" -> \"can cause feelings of anxiety\" -> \"leads to restlessness and anxiety\" -> 90%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Epinephrine)-PART_OF->(Hepatocyte)\n(Epinephrine)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cells)-INTERACTS_WITH->(beta-2 Adrenergic Receptors)\n(Epinephrine)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Pathogenesis)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(beta-2 Adrenergic Receptors)\n(Epinephrine)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cells)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Receptors, Adrenergic, beta-1)\n(Epinephrine)-PART_OF->(Adipocytes)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Receptors, Adrenergic, beta-1)\n(Anxiety)-COMPLICATES/MANIFESTATION_OF->(Disease)-CAUSES->(Agitation)\n(cyclic AMP)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Progestins)-PART_OF->(Liver)-LOCATION_OF->(Glycogen Phosphorylase)\n(Receptors, Adrenergic, beta-1)-1)->(Alcoholic Intoxication, Chronic)-CAUSES/MANIFESTATION_OF->(Disease)-CAUSES->(Contraction)\n(Force)-CAUSES->(Ischemia)-CAUSES->(Premature Cardiac Complex)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3.

Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "### Enhanced Information Analysis\n\n#### Option A: Increases liver glycogenolysis\n- **Reasoning Chain Verification**: Epinephrine activates beta-2 adrenergic receptors, which increases cyclic AMP in liver cells. This activation leads to the stimulation of glycogen phosphorylase, thereby increasing liver glycogenolysis. This chain is consistent with medical consensus.\n- **Evidence Path Relevance**: The path linking cyclic AMP with liver glycogen phosphorylase supports the chain by showing the biochemical pathway involved in glycogenolysis.\n\n#### Option B: Causes bronchiolar constriction\n- **Reasoning Chain Verification**: The chain incorrectly suggests that epinephrine causes bronchiolar constriction. In fact, epinephrine primarily activates beta-2 adrenergic receptors leading to bronchiolar relaxation, not constriction. This is a fundamental error in the chain.\n- **Evidence Path Relevance**: The path mentioning interactions with beta-2 adrenergic receptors supports the fact that epinephrine should cause relaxation, not constriction.\n\n#### Option C: Evokes extrasystoles in the heart\n- **Reasoning Chain Verification**: Epinephrine stimulates beta-1 adrenergic receptors in the heart, which can increase heart rate and the force of contraction. This can indeed lead to extrasystoles (premature heartbeats). This chain aligns with medical consensus.\n- **Evidence Path Relevance**: The path linking beta-1 adrenergic receptors to increased contraction supports the mechanism by which epinephrine can lead to extrasystoles.\n\n#### Option D: Produces restlessness and anxiety\n- **Reasoning Chain Verification**: Epinephrine can stimulate the central nervous system, potentially causing feelings of anxiety and leading to restlessness. This chain is consistent with the known effects of epinephrine on the CNS.\n- **Evidence Path Relevance**: The path linking anxiety to disease and agitation indirectly supports the CNS effects of epinephrine, although it is somewhat broad.\n\n### Conclusion\nBased on the corrected reasoning chains and the relevance of the evidence paths, the action that is not an effect of epinephrine when administered intravenously in a high dose is \"Causes bronchiolar constriction\" (Option B). Epinephrine causes bronchiolar relaxation, not constriction, which is a critical error in the original reasoning chain. The other options are consistent with the pharmacological actions of epinephrine.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Epinephrine, when administered in high doses intravenously, does not cause bronchiolar constriction but rather induces bronchiolar relaxation through the activation of beta-2 adrenergic receptors. This is contrary to the incorrect claim in the original reasoning chain for Option B. The other actions listed, including increasing liver glycogenolysis, evoking extrasystoles in the heart, and producing restlessness and anxiety, are consistent with the known pharmacological effects of epinephrine.\"\n}\n```",
