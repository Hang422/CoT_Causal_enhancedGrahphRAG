      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Physiology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        The fluidity of the plasma membrane is increased by\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Arachidonic acid\nopb. Cholesterol\nopc. Palmitic acid\nopd. Stearic acid\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Arachidonic acid\" -> \"incorporated into phospholipids\" -> \"increases unsaturated fatty acids in membrane\" -> \"increases membrane fluidity\" -> 75%\nCHAIN: \"Cholesterol\" -> \"inserts between phospholipids in membrane\" -> \"modulates membrane fluidity\" -> \"decreases membrane fluidity at high concentrations\" -> \"increases membrane fluidity at low concentrations\" -> 65%\nCHAIN: \"Palmitic acid\" -> \"saturated fatty acid\" -> \"increases membrane rigidity\" -> \"decreases membrane fluidity\" -> 20%\nCHAIN: \"Stearic acid\" -> \"saturated fatty acid\" -> \"incorporated into membrane phospholipids\" -> \"increases membrane rigidity\" -> \"decreases membrane fluidity\" -> 20%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Palmitic Acid)-PART_OF->(Cells)-LOCATION_OF->(saturated fat)\n(Palmitic Acid)-PART_OF->(Liver)-LOCATION_OF->(saturated fat)\n(stearic acid)-PART_OF->(Cells)-LOCATION_OF->(saturated fat)\n(stearic acid)-PART_OF->(Subcutaneous Fat)-LOCATION_OF->(saturated fat)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Arachidonic acid, an unsaturated fatty acid, when incorporated into phospholipids of the plasma membrane, increases the proportion of unsaturated fatty acids. This change enhances the fluidity of the membrane. Cholesterol, on the other hand, has a dual role: at low concentrations, it can increase membrane fluidity by preventing fatty acid chains from packing tightly, but at high concentrations, it decreases fluidity by stabilizing the structure of the membrane. Both palmitic acid and stearic acid are saturated fatty acids that, when incorporated into membrane phospholipids, increase membrane rigidity and thus decrease fluidity. The evidence paths confirm the nature of palmitic and stearic acids as saturated fats, supporting their role in decreasing membrane fluidity. Therefore, the most accurate answer to the question is that arachidonic acid increases the fluidity of the plasma membrane.\"\n}",
