      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Physiology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Which of the following is the best-known metabolic function of the lung\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Inactivation of serotonin\nopb. Conversion of angiotensin–I to angiotensin–II\nopc. Inactivation of bradykinin\nopd. Metabolism of basic drugs by cytochrome P–450 system\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Lungs\" -> \"contain endothelial cells\" -> \"express ACE (Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme)\" -> \"convert angiotensin-I to angiotensin-II\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Lungs\" -> \"express monoamine oxidase\" -> \"inactivate serotonin\" -> \"less known compared to angiotensin conversion\" -> 70%\nCHAIN: \"Lungs\" -> \"presence of enzymes\" -> \"inactivate bradykinin\" -> \"less emphasized function compared to angiotensin conversion\" -> 70%\nCHAIN: \"Lungs\" -> \"contain some cytochrome P-450 enzymes\" -> \"metabolize certain substances\" -> \"not the primary site for metabolism of basic drugs\" -> 60%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Lung)-LOCATION_OF->(Enzymes)\n(Lung)-LOCATION_OF->(Diastasis)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Monoamine Oxidase)\n(Lung)-LOCATION_OF->(Pathogenesis)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Monoamine Oxidase)\n(Lung)-LOCATION_OF->(Diastasis)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Cytochrome P450)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"The best-known metabolic function of the lung is the conversion of angiotensin-I to angiotensin-II. This process is facilitated by the enzyme Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme (ACE), which is highly expressed in the endothelial cells of the lungs. This function is critical in the regulation of blood pressure and fluid balance in the body. While the lungs also participate in the inactivation of serotonin and bradykinin, and contain some cytochrome P-450 enzymes for metabolizing certain substances, these functions are less emphasized and not as well-known as the conversion of angiotensin-I to angiotensin-II. The evidence paths confirm the presence of relevant enzymes in the lungs, supporting their role in these metabolic activities, but the conversion of angiotensin-I to angiotensin-II remains the most prominent and well-documented function.\"\n}",
