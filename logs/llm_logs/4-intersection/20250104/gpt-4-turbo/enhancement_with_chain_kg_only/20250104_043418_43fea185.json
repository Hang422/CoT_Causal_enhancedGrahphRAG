      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        All of the following are true about Nizatidine except\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. It is a H2 blocker used in peptic ulcer disease\nopb. It has 100% Bioavailability\nopc. It also enhances gastric emptying\nopd. It can also lead to tachycardia\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Nizatidine\" -> \"H2 receptor antagonist\" -> \"used in peptic ulcer disease\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Nizatidine\" -> \"H2 receptor antagonist\" -> \"does not have -> 100%\nCHAIN: \"Nizatidine\" -> \"H2 receptor antagonist\" -> \"no significant effect on gastric emptying\" -> \"does not enhance gastric emptying\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Nizatidine\" -> \"H2 receptor antagonist\" -> \"possible side effects include cardiovascular effects\" -> \"can lead to tachycardia\" -> 80%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Nizatidine)-TREATS->(Disease)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Virus)-LOCATION_OF->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Histamine H2 Antagonists)\n(Nizatidine)-TREATS->(Parkinson Disease)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Virus)-LOCATION_OF->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Histamine H2 Antagonists)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "### Enhanced Information Analysis:\n\n1. **Option A: \"It is a H2 blocker used in peptic ulcer disease\"**\n   - **Reasoning Chain Validation**: Nizatidine is indeed a histamine H2 receptor antagonist, commonly used in the treatment of peptic ulcer disease by reducing stomach acid production. This is a well-established fact in pharmacology.\n   - **Evidence Path Relevance**: The path mentioning Nizatidine treating diseases and interacting with histamine H2 antagonists supports this claim, though it is somewhat broad.\n   - **Conclusion**: This statement is true and aligns with medical consensus.\n\n2. **Option B: \"It has 100% Bioavailability\"**\n   - **Reasoning Chain Validation**: The chain incorrectly suggests that Nizatidine has 100% bioavailability. In reality, the bioavailability of Nizatidine is approximately 70-90%, not 100%. This is a critical point of pharmacokinetic properties for this drug.\n   - **Evidence Path Relevance**: The provided paths do not offer specific information on bioavailability, thus they are not helpful in this context.\n   - **Conclusion**: This statement is false and contradicts pharmacological consensus.\n\n3. **Option C: \"It also enhances gastric emptying\"**\n   - **Reasoning Chain Validation**: The chain correctly identifies that Nizatidine does not significantly affect gastric emptying, which aligns with the consensus that H2 blockers, including Nizatidine, primarily reduce acid secretion without affecting gastric emptying.\n   - **Evidence Path Relevance**: The paths provided do not specifically address gastric emptying, so they are not relevant to this claim.\n   - **Conclusion**: This statement is false as per the standard pharmacological understanding.\n\n4. **Option D: \"It can also lead to tachycardia\"**\n   - **Reasoning Chain Validation**: The chain suggests that Nizatidine can lead to tachycardia as a possible cardiovascular side effect. While rare, H2 blockers can have cardiovascular effects including tachycardia, though this is not commonly emphasized.\n   - **Evidence Path Relevance**: The paths do not provide specific insights into this side effect, thus not particularly useful for this claim.\n   - **Conclusion**: This statement is potentially true but represents a less common side effect.\n\n### Summary:\nThe false statements among the options are B (\"It has 100% Bioavailability\") and C (\"It also enhances gastric emptying\"). Both of these contradict established pharmacological facts about Nizatidine. Option A is true and well-supported, while Option D is less common but still a possible side effect. The most critical incorrect statement, which is the answer to the question \"All of the following are true about Nizatidine except,\" is Option B regarding the bioavailability of Nizatidine.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Nizatidine is a histamine H2 receptor antagonist used in the treatment of peptic ulcer disease. It does not have 100% bioavailability; rather, it ranges between 70-90%. Additionally, Nizatidine does not enhance gastric emptying, which is consistent with the action of H2 blockers. While it can lead to tachycardia, this is a less common side effect.\"\n}\n```",
