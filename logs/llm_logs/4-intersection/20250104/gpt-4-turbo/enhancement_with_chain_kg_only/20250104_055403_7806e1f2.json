      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Physiology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Progesterone production in the ovary is primarily by:\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Stroma\nopb. Corpora albicans\nopc. Corpora lutea\nopd. Mature follicles\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Ovulation\" -> \"Formation of corpus luteum\" -> \"Corpora lutea\" -> \"Progesterone production\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Mature follicles\" -> \"Release of egg\" -> \"Less involvement in progesterone production\" -> \"Lower progesterone production compared to corpora lutea\" -> 80%\nCHAIN: \"Corpora albicans\" -> \"Degenerated corpus luteum\" -> \"Reduced hormonal activity\" -> \"Minimal progesterone production\" -> 70%\nCHAIN: \"Stroma\" -> \"Structural component of ovary\" -> \"Limited endocrine function\" -> \"Minor role in progesterone production\" -> 65%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Structure of corpus luteum of ovary)-LOCATION_OF->(Progesterone)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Progesterone production in the ovary is primarily by the corpora lutea. This is supported by the standard physiological consensus that after ovulation, the corpus luteum forms from the remnants of the ovulated follicle. The primary function of the corpus luteum is to produce progesterone, which is crucial for maintaining the early stages of pregnancy until the placenta takes over. This is confirmed by the evidence path linking the structure of the corpus luteum directly to progesterone production. Other structures such as the mature follicles, corpora albicans, and stroma play significantly lesser roles in progesterone production. Mature follicles mainly focus on the maturation and release of eggs rather than progesterone production. Corpora albicans, being the degenerated form of the corpus luteum, have minimal hormonal activity. The ovarian stroma, primarily a structural component, has limited endocrine function and thus contributes minimally to progesterone production.\"\n}",
