Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4.

Glucocoicoids\nopb. Mineralcoicoids\nopc. Aldosterone\nopd. Androgens\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Zona reticularis of adrenal cortex\" -> \"Secretes sex steroids\" -> \"Primarily produces androgens\" -> \"Androgens\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Zona reticularis of adrenal cortex\" -> \"Produces steroid hormones\" -> \"Androgens are a type of steroid hormone\" -> \"Androgens\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Zona reticularis of adrenal cortex\" -> \"Part of adrenal gland\" -> \"Adrenal gland produces various hormones\" -> \"Androgens are among these hormones\" -> \"Androgens\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Zona reticularis of adrenal cortex\" -> \"Located in innermost layer of adrenal cortex\" -> \"Known for synthesizing dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA)\" -> \"DHEA is an androgen\" -> \"Androgens\" -> 95%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Zona Reticularis)-LOCATION_OF->(Androgens)-ISA->(Steroid hormone)\n(Steroid hormone)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Androgens)\n(Adrenal Glands)-LOCATION_OF->(Androgens)\n(Hormones)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Androgens)\n(Adrenal Cortex)-LOCATION_OF->(dehydroepiandrosterone)\n(dehydroepiandrosterone)-INTERACTS_WITH/ISA->(Androgens)\n(Zona Reticularis)-PART_OF->(Brain)-LOCATION_OF->(Steroid hormone)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3.

  "response": "### Enhanced Information Summary\n\nThe zona reticularis of the adrenal cortex is primarily responsible for the secretion of androgens, which are a type of steroid hormone. This is supported by the standard medical consensus that the innermost layer of the adrenal cortex, the zona reticularis, synthesizes significant amounts of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), a precursor to more potent androgens. The evidence paths confirm the location of androgen production in the zona reticularis and their classification as steroid hormones. Additionally, the specific mention of DHEA in the evidence paths aligns well with the consensus that DHEA is an androgen and underscores the role of the zona reticularis in androgen synthesis.\n\nThe other options, such as glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids (like aldosterone), are primarily produced in the zona fasciculata and zona glomerulosa of the adrenal cortex, respectively, and not in the zona reticularis. This distinction is crucial and supported by physiological understanding of adrenal cortex function.\n\nThus, the correct answer, supported by both the reasoning chains and the evidence paths, is that the major hormone secreted by the zona reticularis of the adrenal cortex is androgens.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"The zona reticularis of the adrenal cortex primarily secretes androgens, a type of steroid hormone.
