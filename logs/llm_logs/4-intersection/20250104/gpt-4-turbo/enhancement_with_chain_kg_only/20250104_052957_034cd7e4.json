      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Physiology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Which of the following is not carried in dorsal column of spinal cord:March 2011\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Proprioception\nopb. Vibratory sense\nopc. Heat sensation\nopd. Touch\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Dorsal column of spinal cord\" -> \"carries proprioception\" -> \"Proprioception is correctly associated with dorsal column\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Dorsal column of spinal cord\" -> \"carries vibratory sense\" -> \"Vibratory sense is correctly associated with dorsal column\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Dorsal column of spinal cord\" -> \"does not carry heat sensation\" -> \"Heat sensation is not associated with dorsal column\" -> 98%\nCHAIN: \"Dorsal column of spinal cord\" -> \"carries touch\" -> \"Touch is correctly associated with dorsal column\" -> 95%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Spinal Cord)-LOCATION_OF->(ARSE)-PART_OF->(Prostatic Tissue)-LOCATION_OF->(Therapeutic tactile stimulation)\n(Spinal Cord)-LOCATION_OF->(ARSE)-PART_OF->(Body tissue)-LOCATION_OF->(Therapeutic tactile stimulation)\n(Dorsal funiculus)-LOCATION_OF->(SLIT2 gene|SLIT3|SLIT2)-PART_OF->(Endothelium)-LOCATION_OF->(Therapeutic tactile stimulation)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "### Enhanced Information Summary\n\nThe dorsal columns of the spinal cord are primarily responsible for carrying sensory information related to proprioception, vibratory sense, and fine touch. These functions are well-documented in medical literature and align with the physiological understanding of the spinal cord's role in sensory transmission.\n\n1. **Proprioception**: The dorsal column is known to carry proprioceptive information from the body to the brain. This is a consensus in neurophysiology, and the reasoning chain provided aligns with this understanding.\n\n2. **Vibratory Sense**: Similarly, the vibratory sense is transmitted via the dorsal columns. This is a standard teaching in neuroanatomy and is correctly reflected in the reasoning chain.\n\n3. **Heat Sensation**: Heat sensation, however, is not transmitted via the dorsal columns. Instead, it is carried by the spinothalamic tract, which is part of the anterolateral system of the spinal cord. This is a critical distinction in sensory pathways and is correctly identified in the reasoning chain as not being associated with the dorsal columns.\n\n4. **Touch**: The dorsal columns do carry information related to fine touch. However, it is important to specify that this refers to fine, discriminative touch (such as texture and shape), distinguishing it from crude touch, which is carried by other pathways like the spinothalamic tract.\n\n### Evaluation of Evidence Paths\nThe retrieved evidence paths, while broadly correct about the spinal cord's involvement in sensory processing, do not directly support the specific functions of the dorsal columns concerning the options provided. The paths mention \"Therapeutic tactile stimulation\" and various genetic and tissue components, which are too broad and not directly relevant to the question of sensory modalities carried by the dorsal columns. Therefore, these paths are not included in the final reasoning.\n\n### Conclusion\nBased on the corrected reasoning and standard medical consensus, the option that correctly identifies a sensation not carried in the dorsal column of the spinal cord is:\n- **Heat Sensation (opc)**\n\nThis aligns with the established understanding of sensory pathways in the spinal cord, specifically distinguishing between the roles of the dorsal columns and the spinothalamic tract.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"The dorsal columns of the spinal cord are responsible for transmitting proprioception, vibratory sense, and fine touch. Heat sensation, however, is carried by the spinothalamic tract, not the dorsal columns. This distinction is crucial in understanding sensory pathways in the spinal cord. The evidence paths provided do not directly support these specific functions and are thus not included in the final reasoning.\"\n}\n```",
