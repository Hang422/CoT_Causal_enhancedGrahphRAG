      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Physiology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Which is not secreted by stomach?\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Lipase\nopb. Pepsinogens\nopc.

Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3.

  "response": "### Enhanced Information Summary\n\nThe stomach is known to secrete several substances that aid in digestion. Among these, pepsinogens and hydrochloric acid (HCl) are well-documented. Pepsinogens are inactive precursors of the enzyme pepsin, which is crucial for the breakdown of proteins in the stomach. These are secreted by the chief cells located in the stomach lining. HCl, secreted by the parietal cells of the stomach, provides the acidic environment necessary for pepsin activation and for killing bacteria ingested with food.\n\nLipase is also secreted by the stomach, albeit in smaller quantities compared to its secretion in the pancreas. Gastric lipase plays a role in the digestion of lipids, starting the process which is continued and completed in the small intestine by pancreatic lipase. The evidence paths provided, linking lipase with the stomach through various associations (like with adipocytes and lymphocytes), support the fact that lipase, although not the primary digestive enzyme in the stomach, is indeed secreted there.\n\nGiven this information, all the substances listed in the options (Lipase, Pepsinogens, HCl) are secreted by the stomach. Therefore, the correct answer to the question \"Which is not secreted by the stomach?\" is \"None,\" as all listed options are secreted by the stomach.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"The stomach secretes pepsinogens, HCl, and lipase.

Lipase, although secreted in smaller amounts by the stomach compared to the pancreas, aids in lipid digestion. Therefore, none of the options listed (Lipase, Pepsinogens, HCl) is incorrect as all are secreted by the stomach.\"\n}\n```",
