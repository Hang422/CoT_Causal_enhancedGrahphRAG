Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4.

Filariasis\nopc. Malaria\nopd. Oncocerciasis\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Ivermectin\" -> \"targets parasitic infections\" -> \"effective against Ascaris\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Ivermectin\" -> \"targets parasitic infections\" -> \"used in treatment of Filariasis\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Ivermectin\" -> \"targets parasitic infections\" -> \"used in treatment of Oncocerciasis\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Ivermectin\" -> \"targets parasitic infections\" -> \"not effective against Plasmodium species\" -> \"not used in Malaria treatment\" -> 90%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Ivermectin)-TREATS->(Parasitic Diseases)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "### Enhanced Information Summary\n\nIvermectin is a well-known antiparasitic medication primarily used for treating several parasitic diseases. According to medical consensus:\n\n1. **Ascaris (Roundworms)**: Ivermectin is effective against Ascaris lumbricoides, a type of roundworm. It disrupts the function of the nerve and muscle cells of the worm, leading to paralysis and death of the parasite.\n\n2. **Filariasis**: Ivermectin is widely used in the treatment of filariasis, including lymphatic filariasis caused by Wuchereria bancrofti and river blindness (onchocerciasis) caused by Onchocerca volvulus. It is effective in reducing the microfilariae load in the blood, which is crucial for managing and controlling the spread of the disease.\n\n3. **Oncocerciasis (River Blindness)**: Ivermectin is a cornerstone drug in the treatment of onchocerciasis, significantly reducing the microfilarial load and interrupting the transmission cycle of the disease.\n\n4. **Malaria**: Ivermectin is not indicated for the treatment of malaria. Malaria is caused by Plasmodium species, which are protozoan parasites, not effectively targeted by ivermectin. The drug's action mechanism does not affect Plasmodium, which requires different types of antimalarial medications.\n\nThe retrieved evidence path that Ivermectin treats parasitic diseases supports the use of ivermectin in treating parasitic infections but does not specifically address its ineffectiveness against malaria. Therefore, the correct answer to the question \"Ivermectin is indicated in all of the following except:\" is \"Malaria.\"\n\n```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Ivermectin is effective against parasitic diseases such as Ascaris, Filariasis, and Oncocerciasis, but it is not indicated for the treatment of Malaria, as it does not target the protozoan parasites (Plasmodium species) responsible for the disease.\"\n}\n```",
