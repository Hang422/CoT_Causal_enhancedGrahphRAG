      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Most potent mineralocoicoid is\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Aldosterone\nopb. DOCA\nopc. Fludrocoeisone\nopd. Triamcinolone\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Aldosterone\" -> \"produced by adrenal cortex\" -> \"binds mineralocorticoid receptors\" -> \"increases sodium reabsorption and potassium excretion\" -> \"most potent mineralocorticoid effect\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"DOCA\" -> \"synthetic corticosteroid\" -> \"binds mineralocorticoid receptors\" -> \"less potent than aldosterone in sodium retention\" -> \"not the most potent mineralocorticoid\" -> 80%\nCHAIN: \"Fludrocortisone\" -> \"synthetic corticosteroid\" -> \"strong affinity for mineralocorticoid receptors\" -> \"used for its potent mineralocorticoid properties\" -> \"second to aldosterone in potency\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Triamcinolone\" -> \"synthetic corticosteroid\" -> \"primarily glucocorticoid activity\" -> \"minimal mineralocorticoid effects\" -> \"not a potent mineralocorticoid\" -> 99%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Aldosterone)-PART_OF->(Adrenal Cortex)\n(Aldosterone)-INTERACTS_WITH/ISA->(Mineralocorticoids)\n(Mineralocorticoids)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Aldosterone)\n(Mineralocorticoid Receptor)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cells)-INTERACTS_WITH/LOCATION_OF->(Aldosterone)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Aldosterone is the most potent mineralocorticoid, primarily produced by the adrenal cortex and known for its strong effect on sodium reabsorption and potassium excretion by binding to mineralocorticoid receptors. This is supported by evidence showing Aldosterone's role as part of the adrenal cortex and its interaction with mineralocorticoid receptors. Fludrocortisone, although a synthetic corticosteroid with a strong affinity for mineralocorticoid receptors and used for its potent mineralocorticoid properties, is second to aldosterone in potency. DOCA, another synthetic corticosteroid, binds to mineralocorticoid receptors but is less potent than aldosterone in terms of sodium retention. Triamcinolone, primarily noted for its glucocorticoid activity, has minimal mineralocorticoid effects and is not considered potent in this regard. The evidence paths confirm the specific interactions of aldosterone with mineralocorticoid receptors and its location in the adrenal cortex, reinforcing its role as the most potent mineralocorticoid.\"\n}",
