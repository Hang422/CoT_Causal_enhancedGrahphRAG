Patient gives history of recurrent bacterial infections. Ophthalmic examination reveals white triangular plaques on conjunctiva. This patient is suffering from deficiency of:\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Vitamin D\nopb. Vitamin B\nopc. Vitamin A\nopd. Vitamin C\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Diminished vision during night\" -> \"symptom of night blindness\" -> \"commonly caused by Vitamin A deficiency\" -> \"Vitamin A deficiency\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Dryness of eyes\" -> \"symptom of xerophthalmia\" -> \"commonly caused by Vitamin A deficiency\" -> \"Vitamin A deficiency\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"White triangular plaques on conjunctiva\" -> \"indicates Bitot's spots\" -> \"associated with Vitamin A deficiency\" -> \"Vitamin A deficiency\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Recurrent bacterial infections\" -> \"possible sign of weakened immune system\" -> \"Vitamin A is crucial for immune function\" -> \"possible Vitamin A deficiency\" -> 80%\nCHAIN: \"Vitamin D\" -> \"primarily affects bone health and calcium metabolism\" -> \"not directly linked to night blindness or dry eyes\" -> \"unlikely Vitamin D deficiency\" -> 10%\nCHAIN: \"Vitamin B\" -> \"involved in energy metabolism and neurological function\" -> \"not directly linked to night blindness or dry eyes\" -> \"unlikely Vitamin B deficiency\" -> 10%\nCHAIN: \"Vitamin C\" -> \"important for skin health and immune function\" -> \"not directly linked to night blindness or dry eyes\" -> \"unlikely Vitamin C deficiency\" -> 10%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Night Blindness)-ISA/MANIFESTATION_OF->(Disease)-CAUSES->(Vitamin A Deficiency)\n(Night Blindness)-ISA->(Symptoms)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Ascorbic Acid Deficiency)\n(Xerophthalmia)-CAUSES/PREDISPOSES->(Vitamin A Deficiency)\n(Symptoms)-ASSOCIATED_WITH/CAUSES->(Vitamin A Deficiency)\n(Vitamin A)-ASSOCIATED_WITH/TREATS->(Vitamin A Deficiency)\n(Dry Eye Syndromes)-CAUSES/ISA->(Symptoms)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Ascorbic Acid Deficiency)\n(Immune system)-LOCATION_OF->(Psychotherapy, Multiple)-CAUSES->(Liver Dysfunction)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Vitamin A)\n(Low Vision)-CAUSES->(Blind Vision)-CAUSES->(Night Blindness)\n(Immune system)-LOCATION_OF->(Pain management)-TREATS->(Liver Dysfunction)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Vitamin A)\n(Energy Metabolism)-PROCESS_OF->(Eye)-LOCATION_OF->(Night Blindness)\n(Vitamin B Complex)-TREATS->(Obesity)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Energy Metabolism)\n(Eye)-LOCATION_OF->(Symptoms)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"The patient's symptoms of diminished night vision, dry eyes, and white triangular plaques on the conjunctiva, along with a history of recurrent bacterial infections, strongly suggest a deficiency of Vitamin A. Night blindness and xerophthalmia (dryness of eyes) are classic symptoms of Vitamin A deficiency. The presence of Bitot's spots, the white plaques on the conjunctiva, further confirms this diagnosis, as these are specifically associated with Vitamin A deficiency. Vitamin A is also crucial for maintaining a healthy immune system, which aligns with the patient's history of recurrent infections. The evidence paths support these associations, linking night blindness and xerophthalmia directly to Vitamin A deficiency. Other vitamins such as Vitamin D, B, and C, though important for overall health, do not typically manifest with these ocular symptoms and are therefore unlikely to be the cause in this case.\"\n}",
