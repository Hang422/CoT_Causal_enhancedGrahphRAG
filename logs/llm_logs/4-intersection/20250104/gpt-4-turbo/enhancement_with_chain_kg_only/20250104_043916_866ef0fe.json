      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        The following statements regarding insulin resistance in diabetic patients are true except:\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. It is more common with huminsulin\nopb. It may occur in the presence of infections\nopc. It may be due to antibodies to insulin\nopd. Use of glucocorticoids may be useful in severe cases\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Huminsulin\" -> \"synthetic human insulin\" -> \"similar resistance profile to other insulin types\" -> \"unlikely to be more common with huminsulin\" -> 20%\nCHAIN: \"Infections\" -> \"stress response in body\" -> \"increased counter-regulatory hormones\" -> \"increased insulin resistance\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Antibodies to insulin\" -> \"immune response against insulin\" -> \"reduced insulin efficacy\" -> \"increased insulin resistance\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Glucocorticoids\" -> \"increase in blood glucose levels\" -> \"worsen insulin resistance\" -> \"not useful in severe cases of insulin resistance\" -> 15%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Glucocorticoids)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Insulin)-CAUSES->(Finding of blood glucose level)\n(Finding of blood glucose level)-PREDISPOSES->(Disease)-CAUSES/MANIFESTATION_OF->(Insulin Resistance)\n(Insulin)-CAUSES/PREVENTS->(Insulin Resistance)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "### Enhanced Information Analysis:\n\n1. **Option A (Huminsulin)**:\n   - **Original Chain**: Huminsulin, being synthetic human insulin, is suggested to have a similar resistance profile to other insulin types, implying it is unlikely to be more common with huminsulin.\n   - **Consensus**: Synthetic human insulin, including brands like Huminsulin, generally does not have a higher incidence of insulin resistance compared to other forms of insulin. The resistance profile across different insulin types is more influenced by individual patient factors than by the insulin type itself.\n   - **Conclusion**: The chain correctly aligns with medical consensus that Huminsulin does not inherently cause more insulin resistance than other insulin types.\n\n2. **Option B (Infections)**:\n   - **Original Chain**: Infections trigger a stress response in the body, leading to increased production of counter-regulatory hormones such as glucagon, cortisol, and adrenaline, which in turn can increase insulin resistance.\n   - **Consensus**: Infections are well-documented to exacerbate insulin resistance due to the physiological stress response and elevation of counter-regulatory hormones.\n   - **Conclusion**: This chain is accurate and aligns well with medical consensus.\n\n3. **Option C (Antibodies to Insulin)**:\n   - **Original Chain**: The presence of antibodies against insulin can lead to an immune response that reduces the efficacy of exogenous insulin, thereby increasing insulin resistance.\n   - **Consensus**: The development of insulin antibodies can indeed interfere with insulin action, leading to variability in glucose control and potentially increased insulin resistance.\n   - **Conclusion**: This chain correctly reflects the consensus understanding of the impact of insulin antibodies.\n\n4. **Option D (Glucocorticoids)**:\n   - **Original Chain**: Glucocorticoids are known to increase blood glucose levels and worsen insulin resistance, contradicting the suggestion that they might be useful in severe cases of insulin resistance.\n   - **Consensus**: Glucocorticoids, by their mechanism of action, raise blood glucose levels and exacerbate insulin resistance. They are generally not recommended for improving insulin sensitivity in diabetic patients and can complicate glycemic control.\n   - **Evidence Path**: The path linking glucocorticoids with increased blood glucose and insulin resistance supports the consensus that glucocorticoids are not beneficial in managing insulin resistance.\n   - **Conclusion**: The chain and evidence path align to confirm that glucocorticoids are not useful in severe cases of insulin resistance, contradicting the statement in the option.\n\n### Final Enhanced Information:\nThe statement that \"Use of glucocorticoids may be useful in severe cases\" of insulin resistance is incorrect. Glucocorticoids are known to increase blood glucose levels and exacerbate insulin resistance, making them unsuitable for improving insulin sensitivity in diabetic patients. This conclusion is supported by both the reasoning chain and the evidence path linking glucocorticoids to worsened insulin resistance. Other options correctly align with medical consensus on the causes and exacerbating factors of insulin resistance in diabetic patients.",
