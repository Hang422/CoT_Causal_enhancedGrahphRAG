      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Which of the following antitussive can lead to hallucinations\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Morphine\nopb. Dextromethorphan\nopc. Diphenhydramine\nopd. Aprepitant\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Dextromethorphan\" -> \"acts on central nervous system\" -> \"can cause dissociative effects\" -> \"possible hallucinations\" -> 75%\nCHAIN: \"Morphine\" -> \"opioid receptor agonist\" -> \"primarily causes euphoria and pain relief\" -> \"hallucinations not commonly reported\" -> 20%\nCHAIN: \"Diphenhydramine\" -> \"anticholinergic properties\" -> \"can cross blood-brain barrier\" -> \"possible confusion and hallucinations in high doses\" -> 60%\nCHAIN: \"Aprepitant\" -> \"substance P/neurokinin 1 receptor antagonist\" -> \"used to prevent chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting\" -> \"hallucinations not a known side effect\" -> 10%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Morphine)-INTERACTS_WITH/ISA->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Opioids)\n(Diphenhydramine)-ISA->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Anticholinergic Agents)\n(Opioids)-PART_OF->(Brain)-PART_OF->(Muscle)-LOCATION_OF->(Pain relief)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "### Enhanced Information Summary\n\n**Dextromethorphan** is a well-known antitussive that acts on the central nervous system. It can cause dissociative effects, including hallucinations, particularly at high doses. This is supported by its mechanism of action which involves modulation of the NMDA receptor, a key receptor in the brain associated with excitatory neurotransmission and potential psychoactive effects.\n\n**Morphine**, while an opioid receptor agonist primarily used for pain relief and known to cause euphoria, does not commonly lead to hallucinations. The evidence path linking morphine to opioids and their brain interactions primarily supports its role in pain relief and does not directly correlate with causing hallucinations.\n\n**Diphenhydramine** has anticholinergic properties and can cross the blood-brain barrier, which might lead to confusion and hallucinations, especially in higher doses. This aligns with the known effects of anticholinergics on the central nervous system and their potential to cause cognitive disturbances.\n\n**Aprepitant** acts as a substance P/neurokinin 1 receptor antagonist, primarily used to prevent nausea and vomiting related to chemotherapy. There is no substantial evidence or medical consensus suggesting that aprepitant commonly leads to hallucinations as a side effect.\n\nIn conclusion, among the options provided, **dextromethorphan** is the most likely antitussive to lead to hallucinations, supported by its pharmacological action on the central nervous system and its known dissociative effects at higher doses. Diphenhydramine also has a potential for causing hallucinations but generally at higher doses and less commonly in comparison to the effects observed with dextromethorphan.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Dextromethorphan, an antitussive that acts on the central nervous system, can cause dissociative effects including hallucinations, especially at high doses. Diphenhydramine, with anticholinergic properties, can also lead to hallucinations at high doses but less commonly compared to dextromethorphan. Morphine and aprepitant do not commonly cause hallucinations, with morphine primarily inducing euphoria and pain relief, and aprepitant being used to prevent nausea without known hallucinogenic side effects.\"\n}\n```",
