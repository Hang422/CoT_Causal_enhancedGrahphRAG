      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Drug which do not cause hyperprolactinemia:\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Bromocriptine\nopb. Haloperidol\nopc. Reserpine\nopd. Chlorpromazine\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Bromocriptine\" -> \"Dopamine agonist\" -> \"Decreases prolactin secretion\" -> \"Does not cause hyperprolactinemia\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Haloperidol\" -> \"Dopamine antagonist\" -> \"Increases prolactin secretion\" -> \"Causes hyperprolactinemia\" -> 10%\nCHAIN: \"Reserpine\" -> \"Depletes dopamine\" -> \"Possible increase in prolactin secretion\" -> \"May cause hyperprolactinemia\" -> 30%\nCHAIN: \"Chlorpromazine\" -> \"Dopamine antagonist\" -> \"Increases prolactin secretion\" -> \"Causes hyperprolactinemia\" -> 10%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Bromocriptine)-ISA->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Dopamine)\n(Haloperidol)-INTERACTS_WITH/ISA->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Dopamine Antagonists)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Bromocriptine, a dopamine agonist, effectively decreases prolactin secretion and does not cause hyperprolactinemia, aligning with its known pharmacological action. In contrast, Haloperidol and Chlorpromazine, both dopamine antagonists, increase prolactin secretion, leading to hyperprolactinemia. Reserpine, which depletes dopamine, may also increase prolactin secretion and potentially cause hyperprolactinemia. The evidence paths confirm the interaction of these drugs with dopamine pathways, supporting their respective roles in prolactin regulation. Therefore, among the options, only Bromocriptine does not cause hyperprolactinemia.\"\n}",
