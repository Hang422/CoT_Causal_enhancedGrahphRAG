      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Which of the following diuretics is contraindicated in the presence of cardiac failure?\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Mannitol\nopb. Spironolactone\nopc. Furosemide\nopd. Hydrochlorothiazide\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Mannitol\" -> \"osmotic diuretic\" -> \"increases intravascular volume\" -> \"worsens cardiac workload\" -> \"contraindicated in cardiac failure\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Spironolactone\" -> \"potassium-sparing diuretic\" -> \"reduces aldosterone effects\" -> \"helps manage fluid overload in heart failure\" -> \"not contraindicated in cardiac failure\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Furosemide\" -> \"loop diuretic\" -> \"reduces blood volume\" -> \"decreases preload and cardiac workload\" -> \"used in management of cardiac failure\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Hydrochlorothiazide\" -> \"thiazide diuretic\" -> \"reduces blood volume\" -> \"can be used in stable heart failure management\" -> \"not contraindicated in cardiac failure\" -> 90%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Mannitol)-INTERACTS_WITH/ISA->(Diuretics, Osmotic)\n(Spironolactone)-ISA->(Potassium Sparing Diuretics)\n(Aldosterone)-CAUSES/PREDISPOSES->(Hypernatremia)\n(Hydrochlorothiazide)-ISA->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Thiazide Diuretics)\n(Hydrochlorothiazide)-CAUSES->(Excretory function)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Thiazide Diuretics)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Mannitol, an osmotic diuretic, increases intravascular volume which can exacerbate cardiac workload, making it contraindicated in patients with cardiac failure. This aligns with the standard medical consensus that osmotic diuretics like Mannitol can worsen conditions in heart failure due to the increase in intravascular volume. Spironolactone and Furosemide, on the other hand, are not contraindicated in cardiac failure; Spironolactone is a potassium-sparing diuretic that helps manage fluid overload by reducing the effects of aldosterone, beneficial in heart failure management. Furosemide, a loop diuretic, effectively reduces blood volume and decreases cardiac workload, commonly used in the management of cardiac failure. Hydrochlorothiazide, a thiazide diuretic, although less potent in severe heart failure, is not typically contraindicated unless the heart failure is unstable. The evidence paths confirm the classifications of these diuretics and their mechanisms, supporting their use or contraindication in cardiac failure scenarios.\"\n}",
