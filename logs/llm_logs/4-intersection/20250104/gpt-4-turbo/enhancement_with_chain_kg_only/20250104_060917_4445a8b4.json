      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Which of the following causes retinal pigmentation?\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Quinine\nopb. Chloroquine\nopc. Mefloquine\nopd. Atovaquone\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Chloroquine\" -> \"accumulates in the retina\" -> \"causes retinal toxicity\" -> \"leads to retinal pigmentation\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Quinine\" -> \"used primarily for malaria\" -> \"no strong evidence linking to retinal pigmentation\" -> \"unlikely to cause retinal pigmentation\" -> 20%\nCHAIN: \"Mefloquine\" -> \"used for malaria prevention and treatment\" -> \"no documented cases of retinal pigmentation\" -> \"unlikely to cause retinal pigmentation\" -> 20%\nCHAIN: \"Atovaquone\" -> \"used in combination for malaria and pneumocystis pneumonia\" -> \"no reports of causing retinal pigmentation\" -> \"unlikely to cause retinal pigmentation\" -> 20%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Chloroquine)-PART_OF->(Cells)-PART_OF->(Retina)\n(Chloroquine)-PART_OF->(Antigen-Presenting Cells)-PART_OF->(Retina)\n(Quinine)-TREATS->(Malaria)\n(Mefloquine)-TREATS->(Malaria)\n(atovaquone)-TREATS->(Malaria)\n(Prophylactic treatment)-PREVENTS->(Virus)-LOCATION_OF->(Liposomes)-PART_OF->(Retina)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "### Enhanced Information Summary\n\nChloroquine is known to accumulate in the retina and can cause retinal toxicity, which may lead to retinal pigmentation. This is supported by the evidence path linking Chloroquine to cells in the retina, although the path itself is broad, the specific accumulation in retinal cells is well-documented in medical literature. Therefore, the reasoning chain for Chloroquine correctly aligns with medical consensus and is supported by evidence.\n\nFor Quinine, Mefloquine, and Atovaquone, there is no strong evidence linking these medications to retinal pigmentation. Each of these drugs is primarily used for treating malaria, and their association with retinal pigmentation is not supported by clinical data or documented cases. The evidence paths indicating that these drugs treat malaria do not extend to effects on the retina, thus confirming the lack of direct relevance to retinal pigmentation.\n\nIn conclusion, among the options provided, Chloroquine is the only drug that has a well-established link to causing retinal pigmentation due to its accumulation in the retina and subsequent retinal toxicity.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Chloroquine is known to accumulate in the retina and cause retinal toxicity, potentially leading to retinal pigmentation. This aligns with medical consensus and is supported by evidence paths linking Chloroquine to retinal cells. Quinine, Mefloquine, and Atovaquone, while effective against malaria, do not have documented associations with retinal pigmentation.\"\n}\n```",
