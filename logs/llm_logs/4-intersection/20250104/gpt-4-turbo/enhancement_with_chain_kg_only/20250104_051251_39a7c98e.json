      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Drug given for antibiotic associated pseudomembranous enterocolitis and is part of anti H. Pylori treatment:\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Amoxicillin\nopb. Vancomycin\nopc. Metronidazole\nopd. Clotrimazole\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Amoxicillin\" -> \"used in anti H. Pylori treatment\" -> \"not typically used for pseudomembranous enterocolitis\" -> 60%\nCHAIN: \"Vancomycin\" -> \"treatment for antibiotic associated pseudomembranous enterocolitis\" -> \"not part of anti H. Pylori treatment\" -> 70%\nCHAIN: \"Metronidazole\" -> \"used in anti H. Pylori treatment\" -> \"treatment for antibiotic associated pseudomembranous enterocolitis\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Clotrimazole\" -> \"antifungal medication\" -> \"not used for bacterial infections like H. Pylori or pseudomembranous enterocolitis\" -> 5%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Metronidazole)-PART_OF/TREATS->(Helicobacter pylori)\n(Vancomycin)-CAUSES->(Symptoms)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Gram-Positive Bacteria)-CAUSES->(Enterocolitis, Pseudomembranous)\n(Vancomycin)-CAUSES->(Symptoms)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Bacteria)-CAUSES->(Enterocolitis, Pseudomembranous)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Metronidazole is the correct drug for both antibiotic-associated pseudomembranous enterocolitis and as part of anti-H. pylori treatment. It is widely recognized in medical consensus for these uses. The evidence path confirms Metronidazole's role in treating Helicobacter pylori, aligning with its known application in H. pylori eradication regimens. Additionally, Metronidazole is a standard treatment for Clostridium difficile infections, which are a common cause of pseudomembranous enterocolitis. Amoxicillin, while used in H. pylori treatment, is not typically used for pseudomembranous enterocolitis. Vancomycin is effective against pseudomembranous enterocolitis but is not used in H. pylori treatment. Clotrimazole, being an antifungal, is not relevant for treating bacterial infections like H. pylori or pseudomembranous enterocolitis.\"\n}",
