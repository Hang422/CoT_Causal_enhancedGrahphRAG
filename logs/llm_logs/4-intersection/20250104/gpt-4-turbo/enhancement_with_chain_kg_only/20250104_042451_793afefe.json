  "response": "### Enhanced Information Summary\n\nSchizophrenia is primarily treated with antipsychotic medications. The consensus in medical and pharmacological fields supports that schizophrenia involves an imbalance of neurotransmitters, particularly dopamine. Antipsychotics are effective because they directly target this imbalance by blocking dopamine receptors, which is crucial in reducing the psychotic symptoms associated with schizophrenia. This is supported by evidence paths indicating that antipsychotic agents are associated with and prevent symptoms of schizophrenia, and specifically interact with dopamine to mitigate psychotic symptoms.\n\nWhile antidepressants, mood stabilizers, and antiepileptics are used in the treatment of schizophrenia, their roles are more supplementary and target specific co-occurring symptoms rather than the core psychotic symptoms. Antidepressants may be used to improve depressive symptoms in schizophrenia patients but do not significantly impact the primary psychotic features. Mood stabilizers might be employed to manage mood swings, particularly in schizoaffective disorder, but again, they do not address the primary psychotic symptoms directly. Antiepileptics may be used in cases where seizure-like activities are observed; however, they do not have a significant impact on the primary psychotic symptoms of schizophrenia.\n\nThe evidence paths confirm that while mood stabilizers and antidepressants interact with some symptoms or complications associated with schizophrenia, they do not fundamentally alter the course of the primary psychotic symptoms as antipsychotics do. Therefore, the primary treatment for schizophrenia remains antipsychotic medications, which are specifically designed and proven to reduce psychotic symptoms by addressing the neurotransmitter imbalances at the core of the disorder.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Schizophrenia is primarily treated with antipsychotic medications, which effectively reduce psychotic symptoms by blocking dopamine receptors and addressing neurotransmitter imbalances.
