      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Physiology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        The only Sugar normaly absorbed in the intestine against a concentration gradient is :\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Xylose\nopb. Mannose\nopc. Glucose\nopd. Ribose\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Glucose\" -> \"absorbed via active transport in the intestine\" -> \"requires energy to move against concentration gradient\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Xylose\" -> \"absorbed via passive diffusion\" -> \"does not require energy, not against gradient\" -> 10%\nCHAIN: \"Mannose\" -> \"absorbed but mechanism similar to glucose\" -> \"unclear if against concentration gradient like glucose\" -> 50%\nCHAIN: \"Ribose\" -> \"absorbed via facilitated diffusion\" -> \"does not move against concentration gradient\" -> 10%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Glucose)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cells)-PART_OF->(Intestines)\n(Glucose)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Genes)-PART_OF->(Intestines)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Glucose is the only sugar normally absorbed in the intestine against a concentration gradient. This absorption process involves active transport, which requires energy. The evidence paths indicating interactions of glucose with cells and genes within the intestines support its unique transport mechanism compared to other sugars listed. Xylose and ribose are absorbed via passive and facilitated diffusion, respectively, and do not move against a concentration gradient. The absorption mechanism of mannose is similar to glucose, but there is no clear consensus that it is absorbed against a concentration gradient like glucose.\"\n}",
