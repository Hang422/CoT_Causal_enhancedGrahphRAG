      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Which of the following dings is not used for anxiety?\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Propanolol\nopb. Aiprazolam\nopc. Buspirone\nopd. Haloperidol\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Propranolol\" -> \"beta-blocker\" -> \"used primarily for cardiovascular issues\" -> \"sometimes used off-label for anxiety\" -> 75%\nCHAIN: \"Alprazolam\" -> \"benzodiazepine\" -> \"reduces anxiety\" -> \"commonly prescribed for anxiety disorders\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Buspirone\" -> \"anxiolytic medication\" -> \"specifically targets anxiety symptoms\" -> \"approved for treating generalized anxiety disorder\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Haloperidol\" -> \"antipsychotic\" -> \"used primarily for schizophrenia and acute psychosis\" -> \"not typically used for anxiety\" -> 90%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Benzodiazepines)-TREATS->(Anxiety)\n(Propranolol)-INTERACTS_WITH/ISA->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Adrenergic beta-Antagonists)-Antagonists)\n(Haloperidol)-INTERACTS_WITH/ISA->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Antipsychotic Agents)\n(Antipsychotic Agents)-TREATS->(Acute psychosis)\n(Alprazolam)-TREATS->(Disease)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Virus)-LOCATION_OF->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Benzodiazepines)\n(Alprazolam)-TREATS->(Chronic Disease)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Virus)-LOCATION_OF->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Benzodiazepines)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "### Enhanced Information Summary\n\n**Propranolol** is primarily a beta-blocker used for cardiovascular issues such as hypertension and arrhythmias. While it is sometimes used off-label to manage physical symptoms of anxiety (like tremors), it is not primarily indicated for anxiety disorders. This aligns with the evidence path showing its classification under adrenergic beta-antagonists, which are mainly cardiovascular agents.\n\n**Alprazolam** is a benzodiazepine, a class of medications well-documented and widely prescribed for the treatment of anxiety disorders due to their efficacy in reducing anxiety symptoms. This is supported by the evidence path directly linking benzodiazepines with the treatment of anxiety.\n\n**Buspirone** is an anxiolytic specifically approved for treating generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). It targets anxiety symptoms directly, differentiating it from other psychotropic medications by its specificity and mechanism of action focused on anxiety.\n\n**Haloperidol** is an antipsychotic primarily used for conditions like schizophrenia and acute psychotic states. It is not typically used for anxiety, as its pharmacological profile is more aligned with managing psychosis. The evidence path confirms its classification under antipsychotic agents, which are primarily linked to the treatment of acute psychosis, not anxiety.\n\nBased on the corrected reasoning chains and the relevant evidence paths, **Haloperidol** is the drug among the options that is not used for treating anxiety. The other medications, despite some having broader or off-label uses, have documented roles in anxiety management, either as primary indications or secondary, off-label uses.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Propranolol, while sometimes used off-label for physical symptoms of anxiety, is primarily a beta-blocker for cardiovascular issues.

Haloperidol, an antipsychotic, is not used for anxiety but for conditions like schizophrenia and acute psychosis, aligning with its primary indications and pharmacological profile.\"\n}\n```",
