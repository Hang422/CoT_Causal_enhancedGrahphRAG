      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Physiology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        All are TRUE about protease activated receptors, EXCEPT:\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Family of three seven transmembrane protein\nopb. Activated by thrombin\nopc. Releases PGE2\nopd. Protects epithelial cells\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Protease activated receptors\" -> \"family of four seven transmembrane proteins\" -> \"opa is incorrect\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Protease activated receptors\" -> \"activated by thrombin\" -> \"opb is correct\" -> 99%\nCHAIN: \"Protease activated receptors\" -> \"can release PGE2\" -> \"opc is correct\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Protease activated receptors\" -> \"involved in inflammation and immune responses\" -> \"can protect epithelial cells\" -> \"opd is correct\" -> 85%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Receptors, Proteinase-Activated)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cells)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Dinoprostone)\n(Receptors, Proteinase-Activated)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cells)-LOCATION_OF->(Thrombin)\n(Receptors, Proteinase-Activated)-INTERACTS_WITH->(mast cell)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Thrombin)\n(Receptors, Proteinase-Activated)-CAUSES->(Prostaglandin Production)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Dinoprostone)\n(Receptors, Proteinase-Activated)-Activated)->(Cells)-INTERACTS_WITH/LOCATION_OF->(Integral Membrane Proteins)\n(Dinoprostone)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Genes)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Oligomeric Procyanidin Complex)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "### Enhanced Information Summary\n\n1. **Protease Activated Receptors (PARs)**:\n   - PARs are a family of receptors known to have four members, not three. This is a well-established fact in the field of biochemistry and molecular biology. Therefore, the statement in option A that suggests there are only three members is incorrect.\n\n2. **Activation by Thrombin**:\n   - PARs, particularly PAR-1, PAR-3, and PAR-4, are activated by thrombin. This is a key mechanism in their function, especially in the context of blood coagulation and cellular signaling. The evidence paths showing interactions with thrombin support this, confirming that option B is correct.\n\n3. **Release of PGE2 (Prostaglandin E2)**:\n   - PARs can indeed influence the release of various prostaglandins, including PGE2, through their role in cellular signaling pathways that involve G-protein coupled receptor mechanisms. The evidence path linking PARs to prostaglandin production and specifically to Dinoprostone (PGE2) supports the correctness of option C.\n\n4. **Protection of Epithelial Cells**:\n   - PARs are involved in various cellular processes including inflammation and immune responses. While they can have roles that indirectly influence epithelial cell protection, such as through modulation of inflammation, their primary known functions do not directly include protecting epithelial cells. This makes option D less directly supported, though not entirely incorrect. However, compared to the other options, it is the least directly supported by specific evidence or strong consensus.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBased on the corrected reasoning and integration of relevant evidence paths, the statement in option A about PARs being a \"family of three seven transmembrane proteins\" is the incorrect statement. The other options (B, C, D) are supported by both biochemical consensus and the provided evidence paths, with option D being correct but less directly supported compared to others.",
