      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Biochemistry.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Nyctalopia is due to deficiency of\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Vitamin A\nopb. Vitamin B\nopc. Vitamin C\nopd. Vitamin E\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Vitamin A deficiency\" -> \"reduced production of rhodopsin\" -> \"impaired adaptation to low-light conditions\" -> \"nyctalopia\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Vitamin B deficiency\" -> \"neurological symptoms\" -> \"possible indirect vision issues\" -> \"unclear link to nyctalopia\" -> 20%\nCHAIN: \"Vitamin C deficiency\" -> \"antioxidant reduction\" -> \"possible increased oxidative stress in eye tissues\" -> \"unclear direct link to nyctalopia\" -> 15%\nCHAIN: \"Vitamin E deficiency\" -> \"antioxidant protection reduced\" -> \"possible retinal damage\" -> \"unclear direct link to nyctalopia\" -> 20%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Vitamin A Deficiency)-PREDISPOSES->(Pathogenesis)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Rhodopsin)\n(Vitamin A Deficiency)-CAUSES->(Degenerative abnormality)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Rhodopsin)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Nyctalopia, commonly known as night blindness, is primarily caused by a deficiency in Vitamin A. This deficiency leads to reduced production of rhodopsin, a pigment essential for vision in low-light conditions. The evidence paths confirm that Vitamin A deficiency is associated with pathogenic changes affecting rhodopsin, which directly supports the link between Vitamin A deficiency and nyctalopia. In contrast, deficiencies in Vitamins B, C, and E, while they can affect eye health through mechanisms like neurological symptoms, increased oxidative stress, and potential retinal damage, do not have a direct, well-established link to the specific condition of nyctalopia. Therefore, the most accurate and consensus-aligned answer to the question is Vitamin A.\"\n}",
