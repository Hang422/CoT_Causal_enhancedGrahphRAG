      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Biochemistry.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4.

Retinol\nopb. Retinal\nopc. Retinoic acids\nopd. All of the above\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Vitamin A\" -> \"converted to retinol in the body\" -> \"retinol supports vision and skin health\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Vitamin A\" -> \"metabolized to retinal\" -> \"retinal essential for vision\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Vitamin A\" -> \"converted to retinoic acids\" -> \"retinoic acids regulate gene expression and cell differentiation\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Vitamin A\" -> \"includes retinol, retinal, and retinoic acids\" -> \"all forms are crucial for different physiological functions\" -> \"all of the above are correct\" -> 98%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Vitamin A)-PART_OF->(Cells)-PART_OF->(Retina)\n(Vitamin A)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cultured Cells)-PART_OF->(Retina)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "### Enhanced Information Summary\n\nVitamin A is a crucial nutrient that is involved in several physiological functions through its different metabolites: retinol, retinal, and retinoic acids. Each of these derivatives plays a unique role in the body:\n\n1. **Retinol**: This is the alcohol form of vitamin A and is essential for maintaining healthy skin, vision, and immune function. It is stored in the liver and converted from vitamin A when needed by the body.\n\n2. **Retinal**: This aldehyde form of vitamin A is vital for vision. It is a component of rhodopsin, a protein in the retina that allows the eye to see in low light conditions.\n\n3. **Retinoic Acids**: These are the acid form of vitamin A and are crucial for gene expression, cellular differentiation, and embryonic development. Retinoic acids play a significant role in the regulation of growth and development.\n\nThe evidence paths provided, although broad, support the involvement of vitamin A in cellular functions within the retina, aligning with the known roles of its metabolites, particularly retinal, in vision. However, these paths do not add specific new information about the roles of retinol and retinoic acids.\n\nGiven the comprehensive roles of all metabolites of vitamin A, the correct answer to the question regarding the function of vitamin A is \"All of the above,\" as each form—retinol, retinal, and retinoic acids—contributes significantly to various essential physiological processes.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Vitamin A is essential for multiple physiological functions through its metabolites: retinol, retinal, and retinoic acids. Retinol supports skin, vision, and immune health; retinal is crucial for low-light vision; and retinoic acids regulate gene expression and cellular differentiation. The correct answer to the function of vitamin A is 'All of the above,' reflecting the significant roles of each form.\"\n}\n```",
