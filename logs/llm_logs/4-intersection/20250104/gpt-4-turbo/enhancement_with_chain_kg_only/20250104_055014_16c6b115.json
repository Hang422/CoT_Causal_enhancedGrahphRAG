      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Tocilizumab used against Rheumatoid arthritis is a monoclonal antibody against :\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Interleukin-6\nopb. Interleukin-6 receptor\nopc. Interleukin-5\nopd. Interleukin-5 receptor\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Tocilizumab\" -> \"monoclonal antibody\" -> \"targets specific proteins\" -> \"Interleukin-6 receptor\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Tocilizumab\" -> \"used in Rheumatoid arthritis\" -> \"acts on immune system\" -> \"Interleukin-6 receptor\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Tocilizumab\" -> \"biologic drug\" -> \"binds to receptors\" -> \"Interleukin-6 receptor\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Tocilizumab\" -> \"therapeutic antibody\" -> \"interferes with cytokine interaction\" -> \"Interleukin-6 receptor\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Tocilizumab\" -> \"designed to block specific molecules\" -> \"targets receptor of cytokine\" -> \"Interleukin-6 receptor\" -> 95%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(tocilizumab)-TREATS->(Rheumatoid Arthritis)\n(tocilizumab)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Monoclonal Antibodies)\n(tocilizumab)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cells)-LOCATION_OF->(Monoclonal Antibodies)\n(Monoclonal Antibodies)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Proteins)\n(Proteins)-INTERACTS_WITH/PART_OF->(Cells)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Interleukin 6 Receptor)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "### Standard Medical Consensus:\nTocilizumab is a monoclonal antibody used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. It specifically targets the interleukin-6 receptor (IL-6R), not interleukin-6 itself. By binding to IL-6R, tocilizumab inhibits the receptor's interaction with its cytokine, interleukin-6, which plays a key role in the inflammatory process associated with rheumatoid arthritis.\n\n### Evaluation of Reasoning Chains and Evidence Paths:\n- All reasoning chains correctly identify tocilizumab as targeting the \"Interleukin-6 receptor.\" This aligns with medical consensus.\n- The evidence paths provided confirm tocilizumab's role in treating rheumatoid arthritis and its classification as a monoclonal antibody. The path linking proteins, cells, and the interleukin-6 receptor indirectly supports the specific interaction of tocilizumab with the IL-6 receptor, though it is somewhat broad.\n\n### Irrelevant or Misleading Information:\n- The paths involving general interactions with pharmaceutical preparations and cells are too broad and do not specifically enhance understanding of tocilizumab's mechanism of action against the IL-6 receptor.\n- Options suggesting tocilizumab targets interleukin-5 or its receptor are incorrect and not supported by any evidence or medical consensus.\n\n### Enhanced Information Summary:\nTocilizumab is a monoclonal antibody used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, specifically targeting the interleukin-6 receptor (IL-6R). This action blocks the interaction of IL-6 with its receptor, thereby modulating the inflammatory response that characterizes the disease. The evidence supports tocilizumab's role and mechanism as aligned with its classification and therapeutic use in rheumatoid arthritis, focusing on its interaction with the IL-6 receptor.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Tocilizumab is a monoclonal antibody used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, specifically targeting the interleukin-6 receptor (IL-6R).
