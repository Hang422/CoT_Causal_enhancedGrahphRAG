      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Which of the following anti-tubercular drug is avoided in a HIV positive patient on zidovudine, lamivudine and indinavir therapy who develops TB?\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Pyrazinamide\nopb. Isoniazid\nopc. Ethambutol\nopd. Rifampicin\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Rifampicin\" -> \"induces hepatic enzymes\" -> \"increases metabolism of indinavir\" -> \"reduces effectiveness of indinavir\" -> \"compromises HIV treatment\" -> 75%\nCHAIN: \"Pyrazinamide\" -> \"used in TB treatment\" -> \"no significant interaction with indinavir, zidovudine, or lamivudine\" -> \"safe for use in this patient\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Isoniazid\" -> \"used in TB treatment\" -> \"no significant interaction with indinavir, zidovudine, or lamivudine\" -> \"safe for use in this patient\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Ethambutol\" -> \"used in TB treatment\" -> \"no significant interaction with indinavir, zidovudine, or lamivudine\" -> \"safe for use in this patient\" -> 95%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Tuberculosis)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Virus)-LOCATION_OF->(Lipopolysaccharides)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Zidovudine)\n(Tuberculosis)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Virus)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Retroviridae)-LOCATION_OF->(Zidovudine)\n(Pyrazinamide)-TREATS->(Tuberculosis)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Rifampicin is known to induce hepatic enzymes, which can increase the metabolism of certain drugs including indinavir, a protease inhibitor used in HIV treatment. This induction leads to reduced plasma concentrations of indinavir, potentially compromising the effectiveness of HIV therapy. Therefore, rifampicin is generally avoided in HIV positive patients on a regimen including indinavir. In contrast, pyrazinamide, isoniazid, and ethambutol do not have significant interactions with indinavir, zidovudine, or lamivudine, making them safer options for treating tuberculosis in patients concurrently receiving these antiretroviral medications. The evidence path confirming pyrazinamide's role in treating tuberculosis supports its safe use in this context, but the other paths provided are too broad and do not directly address the drug interactions relevant to the question.\"\n}",
