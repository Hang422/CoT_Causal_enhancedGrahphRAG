Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Seoli cell secrets\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Androgen binding protein\nopb. Testosterone\nopc. LH\nopd. FSH\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Sertoli cell\" -> \"supports spermatogenesis\" -> \"secretes androgen binding protein\" -> \"facilitates concentration of testosterone in seminiferous tubules\" -> 95% CHAIN: \"Sertoli cell\" -> \"located in testes\" -> \"influenced by FSH\" -> \"FSH stimulates secretion of androgen binding protein\" -> 90% CHAIN: \"Sertoli cell\" -> \"does not produce hormones directly\" -> \"does not secrete LH\" -> \"LH is secreted by pituitary gland\" -> 98% CHAIN: \"Sertoli cell\" -> \"supports and nourishes developing sperm cells\" -> \"does not secrete testosterone\" -> \"testosterone produced by Leydig cells\" -> 95%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Androgen-Binding Proteins)-Binding Proteins)->(Germ Cells)-INTERACTS_WITH/LOCATION_OF->(Testosterone)\n(sperm cell)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cells)-LOCATION_OF->(Testosterone)\n(Testosterone)-INTERACTS_WITH/PART_OF->(Structure of interstitial cell of Leydig)\n(Luteinizing Hormone)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Stem cells)-PART_OF->(Pituitary Gland)\n(sperm cell)-PART_OF->(Column)-LOCATION_OF->(Testosterone)\n(Hormones)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Luteinizing Hormone)\n(Luteinizing Hormone)-CAUSES->(Reproductive function)-PROCESS_OF->(Pituitary Gland)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3.

  "response": "### Enhanced Information Summary\n\nSertoli cells, located within the seminiferous tubules of the testes, play a crucial role in supporting and nourishing developing sperm cells through the process of spermatogenesis. One of the key functions of Sertoli cells is the secretion of androgen-binding protein (ABP). This protein binds to testosterone, which is primarily produced by the Leydig cells in the testicular interstitial space, not by the Sertoli cells themselves. The binding of testosterone to ABP facilitates the concentration of testosterone within the seminiferous tubules, which is essential for the proper development of sperm.\n\nThe follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), which is secreted by the pituitary gland, directly influences Sertoli cells by stimulating them to produce ABP. This interaction underscores the hormonal regulation necessary for optimal spermatogenic conditions within the testes.\n\nLuteinizing hormone (LH), also secreted by the pituitary gland, primarily targets Leydig cells to stimulate testosterone production. It does not directly involve Sertoli cells nor is it secreted by them.\n\nIn summary, Sertoli cells secrete androgen-binding protein, which is crucial for maintaining high testosterone levels in the vicinity of developing sperm, thereby facilitating spermatogenesis. This secretion is stimulated by FSH, not by LH, and the testosterone involved is produced by Leydig cells, not Sertoli cells.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Sertoli cells, located in the testes, support spermatogenesis by secreting androgen-binding protein, which binds to testosterone to maintain its concentration in the seminiferous tubules. Testosterone is produced by Leydig cells and its production is stimulated by LH from the pituitary gland. FSH from the pituitary gland stimulates Sertoli cells to produce androgen-binding protein. Thus, Sertoli cells do not secrete testosterone or LH.\"\n}\n```",
