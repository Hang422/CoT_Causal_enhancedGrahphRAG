  "response": "### Enhanced Information Summary\n\nCholecystokinin (CCK) is a hormone that plays a significant role in the digestive system. It is primarily known for its effects on the gallbladder and pancreas.\n\n1. **Contraction of the Gallbladder**: CCK is well-documented to stimulate the gallbladder, causing it to contract. This action facilitates the release of stored bile into the small intestine, aiding in digestion, particularly of fats. The evidence path indicating that CCK causes fluid secretion in the gallbladder supports this function, aligning well with medical consensus.\n\n2. **Secretion of Pancreatic Juice Rich in Enzymes**: CCK also acts on the pancreas, promoting the secretion of pancreatic juice that is rich in digestive enzymes. This enhances the breakdown of nutrients in the small intestine. The evidence paths showing interactions of CCK with parts of the pancreas confirm this role.\n\n3. **Increases the Secretion of Enterokinase**: The role of CCK in directly increasing the secretion of enterokinase (now more commonly referred to as enteropeptidase) from the small intestine is less clearly supported by standard medical consensus. While CCK does influence intestinal function, its direct stimulation of enteropeptidase secretion is not as well-established as its effects on the gallbladder and pancreas. The evidence paths provided do not offer strong support for this function, as they seem to involve broader interactions that do not specifically confirm an increase in enteropeptidase secretion due to CCK.\n\n4. **Option Evaluation**: Given the strong evidence and consensus on the effects of CCK on the gallbladder and pancreas, options (opa) and (opb) are both correct. However, the claim in option (opc) regarding the increase in secretion of enterokinase lacks strong support both from direct medical consensus and the provided evidence paths. Therefore, option (opd), which states \"All,\" is not entirely correct as it includes the unsupported claim about enterokinase.\n\nIn conclusion, the actions of cholecystokinin include the contraction of the gallbladder and the secretion of pancreatic juice rich in enzymes. The claim about increasing the secretion of enterokinase is not strongly supported by current medical consensus or the specific evidence provided.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Cholecystokinin (CCK) is known for causing the contraction of the gallbladder and stimulating the secretion of pancreatic juice rich in enzymes.
