      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Depression is not a side effect of\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Propanolol\nopb. Oral contraceptives\nopc. Reserpine\nopd. Flupenthixol\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Propranolol\" -> \"beta-blocker\" -> \"used for hypertension and anxiety\" -> \"can cause mood changes\" -> \"depression as a possible side effect\" -> 60%\nCHAIN: \"Oral contraceptives\" -> \"hormonal medication\" -> \"affects estrogen and progesterone levels\" -> \"can influence mood and emotional state\" -> \"depression as a possible side effect\" -> 70%\nCHAIN: \"Reserpine\" -> \"antihypertensive medication\" -> \"depletes monoamine neurotransmitters\" -> \"linked to depressive symptoms\" -> \"depression as a known side effect\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Flupenthixol\" -> \"typical antipsychotic\" -> \"used for schizophrenia and other psychoses\" -> \"can influence neurotransmitter pathways\" -> \"depression as a possible side effect\" -> 65%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Propranolol)-INTERACTS_WITH/ISA->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Adrenergic beta-Antagonists)-Antagonists)\n(Flupenthixol)-INTERACTS_WITH->(MAPT)-INTERACTS_WITH/PART_OF->(Cells)-LOCATION_OF->(Antipsychotic Agents)\n(Adrenergic beta-Antagonists)-Antagonists)->(Anxiety)\n(Antipsychotic Agents)-ASSOCIATED_WITH/PREVENTS->(Schizophrenia)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "### Enhanced Information Analysis:\n\n#### Propranolol:\n- **Chain Analysis**: Propranolol is a beta-blocker primarily used for hypertension and anxiety. It is known to cause mood changes, including depression, as a possible side effect. This is consistent with medical consensus.\n- **Evidence Path**: The path linking Propranolol to Adrenergic beta-Antagonists confirms its classification and its potential effects on mood, supporting the chain's claim about depression as a side effect.\n\n#### Oral Contraceptives:\n- **Chain Analysis**: Oral contraceptives, which affect hormonal levels (estrogen and progesterone), can indeed influence mood and emotional states. Depression is a recognized, though not universal, side effect of hormonal fluctuations caused by these contraceptives.\n- **Evidence Path**: There is no direct path provided for oral contraceptives, but the hormonal influence on mood is well-documented in medical literature.\n\n#### Reserpine:\n- **Chain Analysis**: Reserpine is an antihypertensive medication that depletes monoamine neurotransmitters, which are crucial in mood regulation. Its link to depressive symptoms is strongly supported by evidence, making depression a well-known side effect.\n- **Evidence Path**: No specific path provided for Reserpine, but its mechanism of depleting monoamines is a well-established cause of depression.\n\n#### Flupenthixol:\n- **Chain Analysis**: Flupenthixol is a typical antipsychotic used for managing schizophrenia and other psychoses. While it can influence neurotransmitter pathways, the direct causation of depression as a side effect is not as strongly established as it is for its primary effects on psychotic symptoms.\n- **Evidence Path**: The path shows Flupenthixol's interaction with MAPT and its classification under antipsychotic agents, which aligns with its use in schizophrenia but does not directly support depression as a side effect.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBased on the analysis, depression is not a commonly recognized side effect of **Flupenthixol** compared to the other options. While it affects neurotransmitter pathways, its primary association is with the treatment of psychotic symptoms rather than inducing depression. The evidence paths and medical consensus support this conclusion, making Flupenthixol the correct answer to the question.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Depression is not a commonly recognized side effect of Flupenthixol. While it influences neurotransmitter pathways as an antipsychotic used for schizophrenia, its link to causing depression is not strongly established compared to its effects on psychotic symptoms. This conclusion is supported by both medical consensus and the evidence paths provided.\"\n}\n```",
