      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        INH induced neuropathy is treated with\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Thiamine\nopb. Pyridoxine\nopc. Niacin\nopd. Riboflavin\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"INH (isoniazid) use\" -> \"depletion of pyridoxine (vitamin B6)\" -> \"nerve damage\" -> \"neuropathy\" -> \"Pyridoxine supplementation\" -> \"replenishes vitamin B6\" -> \"reduces symptoms of neuropathy\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"INH (isoniazid) use\" -> \"increased metabolic demand for pyridoxine\" -> \"deficiency in pyridoxine\" -> \"neuropathy development\" -> \"Pyridoxine supplementation\" -> \"restores normal nerve function\" -> \"alleviates neuropathy symptoms\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"INH (isoniazid) use\" -> \"interferes with pyridoxine activity\" -> \"leads to peripheral neuropathy\" -> \"Pyridoxine given\" -> \"counteracts the effect of INH on nerves\" -> \"improves nerve health\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"INH (isoniazid) use\" -> \"possible depletion of thiamine\" -> \"possible nerve damage\" -> \"Thiamine supplementation\" -> \"unclear effect on INH-induced neuropathy\" -> 50%\nCHAIN: \"INH (isoniazid) use\" -> \"possible interaction with niacin\" -> \"possible exacerbation of neuropathy\" -> \"Niacin supplementation\" -> \"unclear improvement in neuropathy\" -> 50%\nCHAIN: \"INH (isoniazid) use\" -> \"possible interaction with riboflavin\" -> \"possible effect on nerve health\" -> \"Riboflavin supplementation\" -> \"unclear benefit for neuropathy\" -> 50%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(pyridoxine)-TREATS->(Neuropathy)\n(Nicotinic Acid)-TREATS->(Neuropathy)\n(Demand (clinical)-PREVENTS/TREATS->(Disease)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Saccharomyces cerevisiae)-LOCATION_OF->(pyridoxine)\n(isoniazid)-TREATS->(Disease)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(uptake)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(pyridoxine)\n(isoniazid)-TREATS->(Symptoms)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(uptake)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(pyridoxine)\n(Neuropathy)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Virus)-LOCATION_OF->(Enzymes)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Nicotinic Acid)\n(Neuropathy)-CAUSES->(Diastasis)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Enzymes)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Nicotinic Acid)\n(isoniazid)-TREATS->(Disease)-ASSOCIATED_WITH/PROCESS_OF->(Haemophilus influenzae type b bacteria)-LOCATION_OF->(Riboflavin)\n(Peripheral Neuropathy)-ISA/MANIFESTATION_OF->(Disease)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Saccharomyces cerevisiae)-LOCATION_OF->(pyridoxine)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"INH (isoniazid) is known to cause neuropathy primarily through its interference with the metabolism of pyridoxine (vitamin B6), leading to its depletion. This depletion results in nerve damage and subsequent neuropathy. Supplementation with pyridoxine is the standard treatment to counteract this effect, as it replenishes vitamin B6, restores normal nerve function, and reduces symptoms of neuropathy. The evidence paths confirm that pyridoxine treats neuropathy and is associated with the uptake processes affected by isoniazid. Other vitamins like thiamine, niacin, and riboflavin do not have clear, direct evidence supporting their use in treating INH-induced neuropathy, and their roles in this specific condition remain uncertain or unsupported by current medical consensus.\"\n}",
