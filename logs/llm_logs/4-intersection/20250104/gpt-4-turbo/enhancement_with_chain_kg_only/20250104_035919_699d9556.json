      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Magaldrate is conveed by gastric acid to ?\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Magnesium hydroxide\nopb. Magnesium hydroxide and calcium carbonate\nopc. Magnesium hydroxide and Aluminium hydroxide\nopd. Calcium carbonate and aluminium hydroxide\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Magaldrate\" -> \"reaction with gastric acid\" -> \"forms magnesium hydroxide and aluminium hydroxide\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Magaldrate\" -> \"contact with stomach acid\" -> \"decomposes into magnesium hydroxide and aluminium hydroxide\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Magaldrate\" -> \"exposure to gastric acid\" -> \"breaks down into magnesium hydroxide and aluminium hydroxide\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Magaldrate\" -> \"interaction with hydrochloric acid in stomach\" -> \"conversion to magnesium hydroxide and aluminium hydroxide\" -> 95%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Stomach)-LOCATION_OF->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-CAUSES->(Excretory function)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Magnesium Hydroxide)\n(Stomach)-LOCATION_OF->(Glycerol)-CAUSES->(Excretory function)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Magnesium Hydroxide)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Magaldrate, when reacting with gastric acid, primarily decomposes into magnesium hydroxide and aluminium hydroxide. This transformation is consistent across all provided reasoning chains and aligns with the standard medical and biochemical consensus on the interaction of magaldrate with hydrochloric acid in the stomach. The retrieved evidence paths, although broad, support the presence and relevance of magnesium hydroxide in gastric-related processes but do not directly enhance the specific understanding of magaldrate's breakdown products. Therefore, the most accurate answer, supported by both the reasoning chains and medical consensus, is that magaldrate is converted to magnesium hydroxide and aluminium hydroxide upon contact with gastric acid.\"\n}",
