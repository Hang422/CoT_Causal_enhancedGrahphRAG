      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4.

Loop of Henle\nopd. Collecting duct\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Aldosterone\" -> \"binds to mineralocorticoid receptors\" -> \"increases sodium reabsorption\" -> \"distal tubules\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Aldosterone\" -> \"acts on kidney cells\" -> \"modulates water and electrolyte balance\" -> \"collecting duct\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Aldosterone\" -> \"influences ion transport\" -> \"enhances potassium excretion\" -> \"distal tubules\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Aldosterone\" -> \"regulates blood pressure\" -> \"affects sodium and water retention\" -> \"collecting duct\" -> 90%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Aldosterone)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Mineralocorticoid Receptor)\n(Aldosterone)-INTERACTS_WITH/PART_OF->(Cells)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Renal Cell)\n(Water)-INTERACTS_WITH/PART_OF->(Cells)-PART_OF->(Breast collecting duct)\n(Electrolytes)-COMPLICATES/PREVENTS->(Disease)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Excretory function)-PROCESS_OF->(Breast collecting duct)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3.

  "response": "### Enhanced Information Summary\n\nAldosterone is a steroid hormone that primarily acts on the distal tubules and collecting ducts of the kidney. Its main function is to regulate sodium and potassium balance by binding to mineralocorticoid receptors. This interaction leads to increased sodium reabsorption and potassium excretion in the distal tubules, which is crucial for maintaining electrolyte balance and blood pressure.\n\nThe evidence paths confirm that aldosterone interacts with mineralocorticoid receptors and affects renal cells, which are consistent with its known actions in the kidney. The paths related to water and electrolytes interacting with cells in the breast collecting duct, while correct, are not directly relevant to the specific question about aldosterone's primary site of action in the kidney.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate and consensus-aligned answer to the question \"Aldosterone action is on:\" is primarily on the distal tubules, with significant effects also observed in the collecting duct. This aligns with the corrected reasoning chains that emphasize aldosterone's role in modulating electrolyte balance specifically in these regions of the kidney.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Aldosterone primarily acts on the distal tubules of the kidney by binding to mineralocorticoid receptors, leading to increased sodium reabsorption and potassium excretion. This action helps regulate electrolyte balance and blood pressure. While aldosterone also affects the collecting duct, its primary site of action is the distal tubules.\"\n}\n```",
