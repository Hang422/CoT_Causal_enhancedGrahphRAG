Small intestine\nopd. Large intestine\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Disaccharides ingestion\" -> \"Salivary amylase in mouth begins starch breakdown, not disaccharides\" -> \"Disaccharides remain intact\" -> \"Small intestine\" -> \"Disaccharidases like lactase, sucrase break down disaccharides into monosaccharides\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Disaccharides ingestion\" -> \"Stomach acid deactivates salivary amylase\" -> \"No significant disaccharide digestion in stomach\" -> \"Small intestine\" -> \"Enzymatic action on disaccharides\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Disaccharides reach large intestine\" -> \"No significant disaccharide-digesting enzymes present\" -> \"Fermentation by microbiota, not digestion\" -> \"Incorrect location for disaccharide digestion\" -> 5%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Intestines, Small)-LOCATION_OF->(Disaccharides)\n(Disaccharides)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Lipopolysaccharides)-PART_OF->(Intestines, Small)\n(Disaccharides)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Lipids)-PART_OF->(Intestines, Small)\n(Stomach)-PART_OF->(Intestines, Small)\n(Disaccharides)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Enzymes)\n(Intestines)-LOCATION_OF->(Enzymes)\n(Disaccharides)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Fructose)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Starch)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1.

  "response": "### Enhanced Information Summary\n\nDigestion of disaccharides primarily occurs in the small intestine. This is supported by the consensus that disaccharidases, enzymes such as lactase and sucrase, are located in the small intestine and are responsible for breaking down disaccharides into monosaccharides. The reasoning chains for the mouth and stomach correctly indicate that these locations do not significantly contribute to the digestion of disaccharides. Salivary amylase in the mouth initiates the breakdown of starches, not disaccharides, and is deactivated by stomach acid, confirming that neither the mouth nor the stomach plays a significant role in disaccharide digestion.\n\nThe evidence paths support this conclusion by indicating interactions between disaccharides and enzymes within the small intestine. The paths mentioning interactions with lipopolysaccharides and lipids, which are components of the small intestine, further reinforce the location of disaccharide digestion. The connection between the stomach and the small intestine in the evidence paths does not alter the consensus that the stomach itself is not a site of disaccharide digestion.\n\nThe chain and evidence for the large intestine correctly identify that it is not a significant site for the digestion of disaccharides, as it lacks the necessary disaccharidase enzymes. Instead, any undigested disaccharides reaching the large intestine may be subject to fermentation by microbiota.\n\nIn summary, the digestion of disaccharides occurs in the small intestine, facilitated by specific enzymes such as lactase and sucrase. This process is crucial for the breakdown of disaccharides into absorbable monosaccharides, supporting efficient nutrient absorption and energy utilization in the body.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Digestion of disaccharides primarily occurs in the small intestine, facilitated by enzymes such as lactase and sucrase.
