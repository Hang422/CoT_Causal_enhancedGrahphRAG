Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4.

Tirofiban\nopd. Prasugrel\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Abciximab\" -> \"Gp2b3A inhibitor\" -> 95% CHAIN: \"Eptifibatide\" -> \"Gp2b3A inhibitor\" -> 95% CHAIN: \"Tirofiban\" -> \"Gp2b3A inhibitor\" -> 95% CHAIN: \"Prasugrel\" -> \"Not a Gp2b3A inhibitor\" -> \"Thienopyridine class\" -> \"Inhibits platelet activation by blocking ADP receptors\" -> 95%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(thienopyridine)-TREATS->(Kidney Failure, Chronic)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Virus)-LOCATION_OF->(Liposomes)-LOCATION_OF->(Medical Imaging)-DIAGNOSES->(Mental blocking)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "### Enhanced Information Summary\n\nThe question asks to identify which among the listed options is not a Gp2b3A inhibitor. Gp2b3A inhibitors are a class of antiplatelet drugs that prevent platelet aggregation by blocking the glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor on the surface of platelets.\n\n1. **Abciximab** is correctly identified as a Gp2b3A inhibitor. It is a monoclonal antibody that blocks the glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor, preventing platelet aggregation.\n   \n2. **Eptifibatide** is also correctly identified as a Gp2b3A inhibitor. It is a cyclic heptapeptide that binds to the glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor and inhibits platelet aggregation.\n   \n3. **Tirofiban** is accurately described as a Gp2b3A inhibitor. It is a non-peptide antagonist of the glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor, used to reduce the rate of thrombotic cardiovascular events.\n\n4. **Prasugrel**, however, is not a Gp2b3A inhibitor. It belongs to the thienopyridine class and works by inhibiting platelet activation through the blockade of ADP receptors, not glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptors. This mechanism is distinct from that of Gp2b3A inhibitors.\n\nThe retrieved evidence paths, discussing the thienopyridine class in the context of treatments for chronic kidney failure and its interactions, do not directly support the differentiation of Gp2b3A inhibitors from other antiplatelet drugs. Therefore, this path is not relevant to the question and has been excluded from the reasoning.\n\nIn conclusion, the correct answer to the question \"Gp2b3A inhibitors are all except\" is **Prasugrel**, as it does not inhibit the glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor but rather blocks ADP receptors.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Abciximab, Eptifibatide, and Tirofiban are correctly identified as Gp2b3A inhibitors, which block the glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor on platelets to prevent aggregation.
