      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Pimozide belongs to class of:\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Thiothixanthene\nopb. Phenothiazine\nopc. Butyrophenone\nopd. Diphenyl butyl piperidine\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Pimozide\" -> \"antipsychotic medication\" -> \"belongs to diphenyl butyl piperidine class\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Pimozide\" -> \"used for Tourette's syndrome and schizophrenia\" -> \"not a phenothiazine\" -> \"not a thiothixanthene\" -> \"not a butyrophenone\" -> \"classified as diphenyl butyl piperidine\" -> 95%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Pimozide)-TREATS->(Gilles de la Tourette syndrome)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "### Enhanced Information Summary\n\nPimozide is an antipsychotic medication primarily used in the treatment of Tourette's syndrome and schizophrenia. It is classified within the chemical class of diphenyl butyl piperidine. This classification is supported by standard pharmacological consensus, which distinguishes pimozide from other antipsychotic subclasses such as phenothiazines, thiothixenes, and butyrophenones.\n\nThe reasoning chains provided correctly identify pimozide as not belonging to the classes of phenothiazine, thiothixene, or butyrophenone, and accurately classify it as a diphenyl butyl piperidine. The evidence path mentioning pimozide's treatment of Gilles de la Tourette syndrome aligns with its use indications but does not directly influence the classification of the drug. Therefore, while the path confirms the drug's clinical application, it does not impact the classification task directly.\n\nIn conclusion, the correct classification of pimozide is as a diphenyl butyl piperidine, consistent with pharmacological classifications and not influenced by the broader clinical applications of the drug.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Pimozide is an antipsychotic medication used primarily for Tourette's syndrome and schizophrenia, correctly classified as belonging to the diphenyl butyl piperidine class. This classification is distinct from other antipsychotic subclasses such as phenothiazines, thiothixenes, and butyrophenones. The evidence of its use in treating Gilles de la Tourette syndrome confirms its clinical application but does not influence its chemical classification.\"\n}\n```",
