      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        All of the following drugs are indicated in the treatment of bipolar disorder except?\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Carbamazepine\nopb. Vigabatrin\nopc. Sodium valproate\nopd. Lamotrigine\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Carbamazepine\" -> \"used as a mood stabilizer\" -> \"indicated for bipolar disorder\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Vigabatrin\" -> \"used primarily for epilepsy\" -> \"not typically indicated for bipolar disorder\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Sodium valproate\" -> \"acts as a mood stabilizer\" -> \"indicated for bipolar disorder\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Lamotrigine\" -> \"used as a mood stabilizer\" -> \"indicated for bipolar disorder\" -> 95%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Vigabatrin)-COMPLICATES/TREATS->(Epilepsy)\n(Carbamazepine)-INTERACTS_WITH/ISA->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Mood Stabilizer)\n(Sodium Valproate)-INTERACTS_WITH/ISA->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Mood Stabilizer)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "### Enhanced Information Summary\n\n1. **Carbamazepine**: This drug is indeed used as a mood stabilizer and is indicated for the treatment of bipolar disorder. The reasoning chain aligns with medical consensus and is supported by its classification and interaction as a mood stabilizer in pharmaceutical preparations.\n\n2. **Vigabatrin**: Vigabatrin is primarily used for the treatment of epilepsy and is not typically indicated for bipolar disorder. This aligns with the reasoning chain and is supported by the evidence path that directly links Vigabatrin to epilepsy treatment. This drug does not act as a mood stabilizer and thus is not suitable for the treatment of bipolar disorder.\n\n3. **Sodium Valproate**: Sodium Valproate is used as a mood stabilizer and is indicated for the treatment of bipolar disorder. The reasoning chain is correct and aligns with medical consensus. The evidence path, indicating its role as a mood stabilizer, supports this usage.\n\n4. **Lamotrigine**: Lamotrigine is also used as a mood stabilizer and is indicated for the treatment of bipolar disorder. The reasoning chain is consistent with standard medical consensus.\n\n### Conclusion\nBased on the analysis of the reasoning chains and the evidence paths, all drugs except Vigabatrin are indicated for the treatment of bipolar disorder. Vigabatrin's primary indication for epilepsy and lack of mood stabilizing properties, as supported by the evidence path, confirms that it is not suitable for bipolar disorder treatment.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Carbamazepine, Sodium Valproate, and Lamotrigine are all indicated for the treatment of bipolar disorder as they act as mood stabilizers. Vigabatrin, however, is primarily used for epilepsy and does not have indications for bipolar disorder, supported by its direct link to epilepsy treatment in the evidence path.\"\n}\n```",
