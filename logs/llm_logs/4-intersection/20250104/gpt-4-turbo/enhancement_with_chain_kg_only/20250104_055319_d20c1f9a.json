      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Biochemistry.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        During labor and delivery, a specific hormone causes uterine contractions. This hormone is produced in which one of the following anatomical locations?\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Hypothalamus\nopb. Anterior pituitary\nopc. Posterior pituitary\nopd. Adrenal cortex\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Hypothalamus\" -> \"produces oxytocin-releasing factors\" -> \"stimulates posterior pituitary\" -> \"unclear direct production of contraction-causing hormone\" -> 40%\nCHAIN: \"Anterior pituitary\" -> \"produces various hormones\" -> \"does not produce oxytocin\" -> \"not responsible for uterine contractions\" -> 10%\nCHAIN: \"Posterior pituitary\" -> \"receives oxytocin from hypothalamus\" -> \"releases oxytocin into bloodstream\" -> \"oxytocin causes uterine contractions\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Adrenal cortex\" -> \"produces corticosteroids\" -> \"not involved in production of oxytocin\" -> \"does not cause uterine contractions\" -> 5%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Pituitary Gland, Posterior)-PART_OF->(Hypothalamic structure)-LOCATION_OF->(Oxytocin)\n(Adrenal Cortex Hormones)-PART_OF->(Cell Nucleus)-LOCATION_OF->(Oxytocin)\n(Adrenal Cortex Hormones)-PART_OF->(Cells)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Oxytocin)\n(Hypothalamic structure)-LOCATION_OF->(Oxytocin)\n(Adrenal Cortex)-LOCATION_OF->(Adrenal Cortex Hormones)\n(Pituitary Gland, Posterior)-LOCATION_OF->(Diastasis)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Oxytocin)\n(Pituitary Hormones, Anterior)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cells)-LOCATION_OF->(Hormones)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"The hormone responsible for causing uterine contractions during labor and delivery is oxytocin. Oxytocin is synthesized in the hypothalamus but is not released into the bloodstream from this location. Instead, it is transported to and stored in the posterior pituitary gland. From the posterior pituitary, oxytocin is released directly into the bloodstream, where it can then act on the uterus to induce contractions. The anterior pituitary and adrenal cortex do not produce or release oxytocin and thus are not directly involved in triggering uterine contractions. The evidence paths confirm the role of the posterior pituitary in storing and releasing oxytocin, which is consistent with the standard medical consensus.\"\n}",
