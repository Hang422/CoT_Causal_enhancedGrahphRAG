      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Physiology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Which of the following enzyme is associated with the conversion of androgen to oestrogen in a growing ovarian follicle is:\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Aromatase\nopb. 5 alpha reductase\nopc. Desmolase\nopd. Isomerase\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Aromatase\" -> \"converts androgens to estrogens\" -> \"necessary for estrogen production in ovarian follicles\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"5 alpha reductase\" -> \"converts testosterone to dihydrotestosterone\" -> \"not directly involved in estrogen synthesis\" -> 10%\nCHAIN: \"Desmolase\" -> \"involved in steroidogenesis\" -> \"converts cholesterol to pregnenolone\" -> \"not directly involved in conversion of androgens to estrogens\" -> 15%\nCHAIN: \"Isomerase\" -> \"catalyzes structural rearrangement within a molecule\" -> \"does not specifically convert androgens to estrogens\" -> 10%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Estrogens)-PART_OF->(Ovarian Follicle)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Aromatase is the enzyme responsible for converting androgens to estrogens, which is crucial for estrogen production in ovarian follicles. This aligns with the standard medical consensus that aromatase activity is necessary for the synthesis of estrogen within the growing ovarian follicle. The other enzymes listed, such as 5 alpha reductase, desmolase, and isomerase, do not directly facilitate the conversion of androgens to estrogens. Specifically, 5 alpha reductase converts testosterone to dihydrotestosterone, desmolase is involved in converting cholesterol to pregnenolone, and isomerase catalyzes structural rearrangements within molecules, none of which directly contribute to estrogen synthesis from androgens. The evidence path indicating that estrogens are part of the ovarian follicle supports the role of aromatase in this specific context, as it is directly involved in estrogen production necessary for follicular development.\"\n}",
