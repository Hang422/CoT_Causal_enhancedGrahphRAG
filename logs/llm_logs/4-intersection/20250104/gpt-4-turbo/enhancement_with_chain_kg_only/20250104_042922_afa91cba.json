      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Physiology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Aldosterone acts at:\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Collecting duct\nopb. Glomerulus\nopc. Proximal convoluted tubule\nopd. Loop of Henle\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Aldosterone\" -> \"binds to mineralocorticoid receptors\" -> \"increases sodium reabsorption\" -> \"in the collecting duct\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Aldosterone\" -> \"acts on kidney cells\" -> \"modulates water and electrolyte balance\" -> \"not primarily in the glomerulus\" -> \"unclear effect here\" -> 20%\nCHAIN: \"Aldosterone\" -> \"targets renal tubular cells\" -> \"not significant in proximal convoluted tubule\" -> \"unclear effect here\" -> 15%\nCHAIN: \"Aldosterone\" -> \"influences ion transport\" -> \"not active in the loop of Henle\" -> \"unclear effect here\" -> 10%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Aldosterone)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Mineralocorticoid Receptor)\n(Aldosterone)-INTERACTS_WITH/PART_OF->(Cells)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Renal Cell)\n(Water)-INTERACTS_WITH/PART_OF->(Cells)-PART_OF->(Kidney Glomerulus)\n(Electrolytes)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Genes)-PART_OF->(Kidney Glomerulus)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Aldosterone primarily acts at the collecting duct of the kidney. It binds to mineralocorticoid receptors, which are expressed in the cells of the collecting duct, leading to increased sodium reabsorption and potassium secretion. This action helps in the regulation of blood pressure and electrolyte balance. The evidence path confirming aldosterone's interaction with mineralocorticoid receptors supports this function. Other renal structures like the glomerulus, proximal convoluted tubule, and loop of Henle do not significantly interact with aldosterone in terms of sodium and water balance, aligning with medical consensus that the primary site of aldosterone action is the collecting duct.\"\n}",
