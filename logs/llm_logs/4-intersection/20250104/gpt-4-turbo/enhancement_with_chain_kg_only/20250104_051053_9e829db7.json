      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Which of the following antitubercular drugs can be safely used in severe renal failure :\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Streptomycin\nopb. Ethambutol\nopc. Capreomycin\nopd. Rifampicin\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Severe renal failure\" -> \"reduced kidney function\" -> \"need for drugs with minimal renal metabolism or excretion\" -> \"Rifampicin primarily metabolized by the liver\" -> \"Rifampicin safe in severe renal failure\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Severe renal failure\" -> \"reduced kidney function\" -> \"need for drugs that do not accumulate toxic metabolites in renal failure\" -> \"Ethambutol has potential for dose-related toxicity\" -> \"Ethambutol use requires careful monitoring and dose adjustment in renal failure\" -> \"Ethambutol possibly safe with adjustments\" -> 60%\nCHAIN: \"Severe renal failure\" -> \"reduced kidney function\" -> \"need to avoid drugs excreted primarily by kidneys\" -> \"Streptomycin excreted mainly by kidneys\" -> \"Streptomycin risky in severe renal failure\" -> 30%\nCHAIN: \"Severe renal failure\" -> \"reduced kidney function\" -> \"need to avoid drugs excreted primarily by kidneys\" -> \"Capreomycin excreted mainly by kidneys\" -> \"Capreomycin risky in severe renal failure\" -> 30%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Ethambutol)-TREATS->(Disease)-COMPLICATES/PREDISPOSES->(Kidney Failure)\n(Streptomycin)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Disease)-COMPLICATES/PREDISPOSES->(Kidney Failure)\n(Kidney Failure)-MANIFESTATION_OF/PREDISPOSES->(Pathogenesis)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(NPM1 gene|NPM1)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Ethambutol)\n(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-PREVENTS/TREATS->(Virus)-LOCATION_OF->(Streptomycin)\n(Kidney)-LOCATION_OF->(Streptomycin)\n(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(TBC1D1)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Ethambutol)\n(Liver)-LOCATION_OF->(Kidney Failure)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "### Enhanced Information Summary\n\n**Rifampicin**: Rifampicin is primarily metabolized by the liver, making it a safer choice in patients with severe renal failure as it minimizes the risk associated with renal clearance. This aligns with the standard medical consensus that drugs primarily metabolized by the liver are preferable in cases of renal impairment. The reasoning chain for Rifampicin correctly identifies its liver metabolism and suitability for use in severe renal failure, and there is no contradictory evidence from the retrieved paths.\n\n**Ethambutol**: Ethambutol is known to require dose adjustments in renal failure due to its potential for toxicity, particularly affecting vision. The reasoning chain correctly notes the need for careful monitoring and dose adjustment in renal failure. The evidence paths mentioning Ethambutol's interaction with kidney-related genes and disease pathways support the need for caution due to potential complications in renal failure, reinforcing the chain's conclusion that Ethambutol can be used but with significant caution and adjustments.\n\n**Streptomycin and Capreomycin**: Both drugs are primarily excreted by the kidneys, posing a higher risk in patients with severe renal failure due to the potential for drug accumulation and subsequent toxicity. The reasoning chains for both drugs correctly identify them as risky in the context of severe renal failure. The evidence paths, particularly noting the kidney as a location of Streptomycin, support the conclusion that these drugs should generally be avoided in severe renal failure due to their renal excretion.\n\n### Conclusion\nBased on the corrected reasoning chains and supported by relevant evidence paths, **Rifampicin** is the safest option among the listed antitubercular drugs for use in patients with severe renal failure due to its liver metabolism. Ethambutol may be used with caution and necessary dose adjustments. Streptomycin and Capreomycin are less suitable due to their renal excretion and associated risks in the context of reduced kidney function.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Rifampicin, primarily metabolized by the liver, is the safest antitubercular drug for use in severe renal failure.
