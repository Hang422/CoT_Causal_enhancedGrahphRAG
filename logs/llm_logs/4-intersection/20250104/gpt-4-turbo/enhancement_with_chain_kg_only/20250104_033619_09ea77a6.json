Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        All are TRUE about protease activated receptors, EXCEPT:\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Family of three seven transmembrane protein\nopb. Activated by thrombin\nopc. Releases PGE2\nopd. Protects epithelial cells\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Protease activated receptors\" -> \"family of four seven transmembrane proteins\" -> \"opa is incorrect\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Protease activated receptors\" -> \"activated by thrombin\" -> \"opb is correct\" -> 99%\nCHAIN: \"Protease activated receptors\" -> \"can release PGE2\" -> \"opc is correct\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Protease activated receptors\" -> \"involved in inflammation and immune responses\" -> \"can protect epithelial cells\" -> \"opd is correct\" -> 85%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Receptors, Proteinase-Activated)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cells)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Dinoprostone)\n(Receptors, Proteinase-Activated)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cells)-LOCATION_OF->(Thrombin)\n(Receptors, Proteinase-Activated)-INTERACTS_WITH->(mast cell)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Thrombin)\n(Receptors, Proteinase-Activated)-CAUSES->(Prostaglandin Production)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Dinoprostone)\n(Receptors, Proteinase-Activated)-Activated)->(Cells)-INTERACTS_WITH/LOCATION_OF->(Integral Membrane Proteins)\n(Dinoprostone)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Genes)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Oligomeric Procyanidin Complex)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3.

  "response": "### Enhanced Information Summary\n\n1. **Protease Activated Receptors (PARs) Family**: Protease activated receptors are a family of four, not three, seven-transmembrane domain G-protein-coupled receptors. This is a well-established fact in receptor physiology, contradicting the statement in option opa. Therefore, opa is incorrect as it undercounts the number of receptors in the family.\n\n2. **Activation by Thrombin**: PARs, particularly PAR-1, PAR-3, and PAR-4, are known to be activated by thrombin. This is a key mechanism in their role in coagulation and cellular signaling processes. The evidence path showing interaction with thrombin supports this, confirming that option opb is correct.\n\n3. **Release of PGE2**: PARs can indeed influence the release of prostaglandins, including PGE2 (Dinoprostone), through their role in cellular signaling pathways that involve inflammation and pain mechanisms. The evidence path linking PARs to prostaglandin production and specifically to Dinoprostone aligns with this function, supporting that option opc is correct.\n\n4. **Protection of Epithelial Cells**: While PARs are involved in various cellular responses including inflammation and immune responses, direct evidence specifically affirming their role in protecting epithelial cells is less definitive. Although they can be involved in mechanisms that indirectly benefit epithelial integrity, the statement in option opd might be considered too broad or not universally accepted without specific qualifiers or additional context. However, in the absence of direct contradicting evidence, it remains plausible and is considered correct based on general consensus about their involvement in cellular protective mechanisms.\n\nIn conclusion, the only incorrect statement among the options is opa, which inaccurately describes the number of PAR family members. The other options are supported by both consensus and the provided evidence paths.",
