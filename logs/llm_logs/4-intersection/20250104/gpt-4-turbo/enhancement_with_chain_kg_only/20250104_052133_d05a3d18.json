      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Physiology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Testosterone production is mainly contributed by\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Leydig cells\nopb. Seolie cells\nopc. Seminiferous tubules\nopd. Epididymis\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Leydig cells\" -> \"located in the testes\" -> \"primary source of testosterone in males\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Sertoli cells\" -> \"support and nourish developing sperm cells\" -> \"do not primarily produce testosterone\" -> 80%\nCHAIN: \"Seminiferous tubules\" -> \"site of sperm production\" -> \"testosterone production is not their primary function\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Epididymis\" -> \"stores and transports sperm\" -> \"not involved in testosterone production\" -> 80%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(sperm cell)-PART_OF->(Column)-LOCATION_OF->(Testosterone)\n(Inferior Colliculus)-LOCATION_OF->(Testosterone)\n(sperm cell)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cells)-LOCATION_OF->(Testosterone)\n(Seminiferous tubule structure)-LOCATION_OF->(Lipids)-PART_OF->(sperm cell)\n(Mobility aid)-CAUSES/TREATS->(Inflammation)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Genes)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Testosterone)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "### Enhanced Information Summary\n\nTestosterone production in males is primarily carried out by Leydig cells, which are located in the interstitial space of the testes. These cells are specifically responsible for synthesizing and secreting testosterone, the primary male sex hormone, which plays a crucial role in the development of male reproductive tissues as well as promoting secondary sexual characteristics such as muscle and bone mass, and the growth of body hair.\n\nThe reasoning chain for Leydig cells accurately reflects this role, stating that they are \"located in the testes\" and are the \"primary source of testosterone in males.\" This is well-supported by standard medical consensus and does not require correction.\n\nThe other options provided:\n- Sertoli cells, primarily function to support and nourish developing spermatozoa within the seminiferous tubules and do not primarily produce testosterone.\n- Seminiferous tubules are involved in the production of sperm, not testosterone.\n- The epididymis is responsible for the storage and transport of sperm, and it does not participate in the production of testosterone.\n\nThe retrieved evidence paths, while broad, do not provide direct or useful clarification on the specific roles of these cells and structures in testosterone production. Therefore, they do not contribute meaningfully to the decision-making process for this question and are excluded from the final summary.\n\nIn conclusion, among the given options, Leydig cells are the correct answer as they are the main contributors to testosterone production in males. This aligns with the established medical and physiological consensus.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Testosterone production in males is primarily carried out by Leydig cells, located in the interstitial space of the testes.
