Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        The placenta secretes a hormone that is utilized in the early detection of pregnancy. This hormone is:\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Endothelial growth factor (EGF)\nopb. Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG)\nopc. Human chorionic somatotropin (HCS)\nopd. Relaxin\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Placenta\" -> \"Secretes hormone\" -> \"Used in pregnancy tests\" -> \"Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG)\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Placenta\" -> \"Produces various hormones\" -> \"Early pregnancy detection\" -> \"Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) identified in urine\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG)\" -> \"Produced by placenta\" -> \"Detected by pregnancy tests\" -> \"Confirms pregnancy\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Endothelial growth factor (EGF)\" -> \"Involved in cell growth\" -> \"Not specific to pregnancy\" -> \"Unlikely used in pregnancy tests\" -> 10%\nCHAIN: \"Human chorionic somatotropin (HCS)\" -> \"Produced by placenta\" -> \"Influences metabolism during pregnancy\" -> \"Not used in early pregnancy tests\" -> 10%\nCHAIN: \"Relaxin\" -> \"Produced by placenta\" -> \"Involved in labor\" -> \"Not used for early pregnancy detection\" -> 10%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Pregnancy Tests)-DIAGNOSES->(Infertility)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Human Chorionic Gonadotropin)\n(Pregnancy Tests)-DIAGNOSES->(Spontaneous abortion)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Human Chorionic Gonadotropin)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) is the hormone secreted by the placenta that is utilized in the early detection of pregnancy. This is confirmed by its presence in urine, which is the basis for most home pregnancy tests. The reasoning chains and evidence paths strongly support hCG's role in pregnancy detection, aligning with medical consensus. Other hormones such as Endothelial Growth Factor (EGF), Human Chorionic Somatotropin (HCS), and Relaxin, although produced by the placenta, do not play a role in the early detection of pregnancy. EGF is involved in cell growth and not specific to pregnancy, HCS influences metabolism during pregnancy but is not used in pregnancy tests, and Relaxin is involved in labor rather than pregnancy detection.\"\n}",
