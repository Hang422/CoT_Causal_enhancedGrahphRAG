  "response": "```json\n{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Opioids are known to have several pharmacological effects including analgesia, cough suppression, and causing miosis (pupil constriction). They are also associated with causing nausea and vomiting in some cases, but they can be used in the management of vomiting under certain conditions. However, opioids are known to cause muscle rigidity, including truncal rigidity, which is a well-documented side effect, particularly with high doses or rapid administration. Therefore, the statement that opioids have an anti-emetic effect (reduce vomiting) is not typically accurate as their primary action can actually induce vomiting.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opb\",\n    \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
