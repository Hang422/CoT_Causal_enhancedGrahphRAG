Increase in glucagon/insulin ratio, increased CAMP and increased blood glucose\nopb. Decreased insulin, increased free fatty acid which is equivalent to blood glucose\nopc. Decreased insulin, increased free fatty acid which is not equivalent to blood glucose\nopd. Elevated insulin and free fatty acid, equivalent to blood glucose\n\n### Retrieved Similar Medical Knowledge:\n- In situ perfusion ISA Therapeutic procedure\n- PRDM16 PART_OF Saccharomyces cerevisiae\n- Disease PREDISPOSES Diabetic Ketoacidosis\n- Diabetic Ketoacidosis PREDISPOSES Diabetes\n- Starvation CAUSES Diabetic Ketoacidosis\n- GPR18 INTERACTS_WITH Cells\n- Blood Vessels LOCATION_OF Parkinsonian Disorders\n- Symptoms PREDISPOSES Diabetic Ketoacidosis\n\n    ### Instructions:\n            - Use standard medical knowledge as the primary guide.\n            - Consider enhanced information only if it aligns with consensus.\n            - If conflicting or unclear, present the most likely correct answer based on known facts.\n            - It's acceptable to show moderate confidence if the question is complex, but still choose one best answer.\n    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3.

  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is primarily characterized by an increased glucagon/insulin ratio, which leads to increased lipolysis and free fatty acid release. These free fatty acids are then converted into ketone bodies, contributing to the acidotic state. The increase in glucagon relative to insulin is crucial as it promotes gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis, thereby increasing blood glucose levels. This pathophysiological sequence aligns with the description in option 'opa', which mentions an increase in the glucagon/insulin ratio, increased cAMP (cyclic AMP, which is involved in the signaling pathways that promote gluconeogenesis and lipolysis), and increased blood glucose. The other options either do not correctly reflect the relationship between insulin and glucagon in the context of DKA or incorrectly equate the levels of free fatty acids to blood glucose, which is not characteristic of DKA.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opa\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}",
