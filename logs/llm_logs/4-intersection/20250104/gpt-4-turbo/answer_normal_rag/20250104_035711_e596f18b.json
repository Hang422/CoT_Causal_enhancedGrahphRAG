  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Secretin primarily functions to regulate the pH of the small intestine by promoting the secretion of bicarbonate from the pancreas, which helps neutralize the acidic chyme received from the stomach. This action is crucial for protecting the intestinal mucosa and providing an optimal environment for enzymatic activity. The retrieved medical knowledge confirms the interaction of secretin with endocrine cells, which are involved in these regulatory processes. Although secretin also has effects on gastric secretion and the gastrointestinal motility, its most prominent and well-recognized role is in stimulating the pancreas to release bicarbonate.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opb\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}",
