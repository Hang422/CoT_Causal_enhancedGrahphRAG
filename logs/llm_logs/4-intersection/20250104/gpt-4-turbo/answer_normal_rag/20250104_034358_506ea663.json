His 3-year-old sibling should receive INH prophylaxis\nopb. A baseline test of auditory function test is essential before drug treatment is initiated\nopc.

  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"The question pertains to the management of a child with tuberculosis and the prophylactic measures for his close contacts. Isoniazid (INH) prophylaxis is recommended for close contacts of individuals with active tuberculosis, especially in children under 5 years of age who are at higher risk of developing tuberculosis if infected. This is because young children are more likely to progress from tuberculosis infection to disease. Therefore, the 3-year-old sibling should indeed receive INH prophylaxis to prevent the development of tuberculosis. The other options, while related to tuberculosis treatment, do not directly apply to the scenario described. Baseline auditory function tests are more relevant for drugs like streptomycin, not typically for the drugs mentioned. Polyarthralgia is not a commonly recognized side effect of the drugs listed. The mother's need for INH prophylaxis would depend on her own exposure and health status, not just on her caregiving role.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opa\",\n    \"confidence\": 90\n}",
