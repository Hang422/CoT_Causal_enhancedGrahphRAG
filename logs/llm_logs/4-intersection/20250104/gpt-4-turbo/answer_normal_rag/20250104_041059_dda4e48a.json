  "response": "```json\n{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Insulin is a hormone produced by the beta cells of the pancreatic islets, not the alpha cells, which produce glucagon, thus eliminating option 'opa'. Insulin indeed consists of two polypeptide chains (A and B chains) that are connected by disulfide bonds, making option 'opb' correct. Regarding option 'opc', insulin promotes the uptake of potassium into the cells, not shifting it outside, which contradicts the statement. Lastly, the half-life of subcutaneous insulin (s.c insulin) is generally around 5 to 10 minutes, not 60 minutes, which rules out option 'opd'. Therefore, the correct answer based on standard medical knowledge is that insulin consists of two polypeptide chains linked by disulfide bonds.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opb\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
