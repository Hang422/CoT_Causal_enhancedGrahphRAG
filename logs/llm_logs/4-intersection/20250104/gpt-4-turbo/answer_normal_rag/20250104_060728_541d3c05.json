  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Among the drugs listed, Chloramphenicol is primarily known as an antibiotic and does not commonly cause myopathy, which is a disease of the muscle fibers. Chloroquine, Betamethasone, and Zidovudine have been associated with myopathy or muscle weakness as potential side effects. Chloroquine can cause myopathy or neuropathy, particularly with long-term use. Betamethasone, a corticosteroid, can lead to steroid myopathy, especially with high doses or prolonged therapy. Zidovudine, an antiretroviral drug, is known to cause myopathy as a significant side effect. Therefore, based on standard medical knowledge, Chloramphenicol is the correct answer as it is not typically associated with myopathy.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opc\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}",
