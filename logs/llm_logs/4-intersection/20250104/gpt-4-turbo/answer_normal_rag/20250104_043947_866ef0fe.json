It is more common with huminsulin\nopb. It may occur in the presence of infections\nopc. It may be due to antibodies to insulin\nopd. Use of glucocorticoids may be useful in severe cases\n\n### Retrieved Similar Medical Knowledge:\n- Candida lipolytica LOCATION_OF Enzymes\n- Insulin Resistance ASSOCIATED_WITH Insulin\n- Leptin|LEP ASSOCIATED_WITH Infection\n- lactic acid bacteria LOCATION_OF Lipids\n- NEDD8 INTERACTS_WITH Cells\n- Degenerative abnormality CAUSES Myopathy\n- Glucocorticoids TREATS Insulin Resistance\n\n    ### Instructions:\n            - Use standard medical knowledge as the primary guide.\n            - Consider enhanced information only if it aligns with consensus.\n            - If conflicting or unclear, present the most likely correct answer based on known facts.\n            - It's acceptable to show moderate confidence if the question is complex, but still choose one best answer.\n    ### Task:\n                1.

  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Analyzing the options based on standard medical knowledge: Option A suggests that insulin resistance is more common with huminsulin, which is not supported by general medical consensus as insulin resistance is typically associated with factors like obesity, genetics, and certain medications, rather than specific brands or types of insulin. Option B is accurate as infections can indeed exacerbate insulin resistance. Option C is also true, as the presence of antibodies to insulin can cause insulin resistance, particularly in cases where patients have been exposed to animal insulin preparations. Option D, however, is misleading; while glucocorticoids are known to influence blood glucose levels, they generally increase insulin resistance and are not typically used to manage insulin resistance in diabetic patients due to their hyperglycemic effect. Therefore, the statement in Option D is incorrect in the context of treating insulin resistance in diabetic patients.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opd\",\n    \"confidence\": 90\n}",
