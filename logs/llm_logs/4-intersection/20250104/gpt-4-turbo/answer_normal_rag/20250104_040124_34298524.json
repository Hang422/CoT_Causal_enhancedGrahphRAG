  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Brinzolamide is a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor used primarily in the treatment of glaucoma. It functions by inhibiting the enzyme carbonic anhydrase, which is crucial in fluid secretion and intraocular pressure regulation. The inhibition of this enzyme reduces the production of aqueous humor, thereby decreasing intraocular pressure. Brinzolamide is known to be a reversible inhibitor, meaning it binds to the enzyme and can dissociate from it, allowing normal enzyme function to resume when the drug is no longer present. Additionally, it is a competitive inhibitor, which means it competes with the natural substrate (carbon dioxide) for the active site of the enzyme. Therefore, the correct answer is that Brinzolamide is a highly specific reversible and competitive inhibitor of carbonic anhydrase.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opc\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}",
