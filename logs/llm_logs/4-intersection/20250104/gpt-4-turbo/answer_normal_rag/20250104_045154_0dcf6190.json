This aligns with standard medical guidelines that recommend Metronidazole as a primary treatment option for this condition. The other options, such as Clindamycin, Erythromycin, and Ampicillin, are not directly supported by the retrieved data for being the treatment of choice for bacterial vaginosis, although Clindamycin can also be used as an alternative treatment. Based on the evidence and standard medical practice, Metronidazole is the most supported and commonly recommended treatment.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opd\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}",
