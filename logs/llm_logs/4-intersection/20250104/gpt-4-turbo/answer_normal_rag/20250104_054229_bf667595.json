This aligns with standard medical consensus that desmopressin is the preferred treatment for neurogenic (central) diabetes insipidus due to its efficacy and safety profile. Other options like vasopressin and its analogs (terlipressin, pralipressin) are less specific and have broader applications, making desmopressin the most targeted and effective choice for this particular condition.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opc\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
