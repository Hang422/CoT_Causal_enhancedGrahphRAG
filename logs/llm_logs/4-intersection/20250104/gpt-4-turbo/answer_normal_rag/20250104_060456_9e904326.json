  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"The drug of choice for a pregnant female suspected of having a baby with congenital adrenal hyperplasia is typically a corticosteroid that can cross the placenta and suppress fetal adrenal androgen production. Dexamethasone and betamethasone are both potent corticosteroids capable of crossing the placenta, but dexamethasone is more commonly used for prenatal treatment of congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to its minimal mineralocorticoid effects and better suppression of fetal adrenal androgens. Hydrocortisone, while used to treat classic congenital adrenal hyperplasia postnatally, does not effectively cross the placenta and thus is not suitable for prenatal treatment. Prednisolone is also less favored due to its intermediate potency and less effective placental crossing compared to dexamethasone.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opa\",\n    \"confidence\": 90\n}",
