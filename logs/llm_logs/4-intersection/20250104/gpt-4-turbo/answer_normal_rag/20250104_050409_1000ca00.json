  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Shock is a critical condition that leads to reduced blood flow and oxygen delivery to tissues, resulting in various types of hypoxia. Among the options provided, 'hypoxic hypoxia' is the most relevant. Hypoxic hypoxia occurs when there is insufficient oxygen in the blood, a common consequence in shock due to poor perfusion. The retrieved medical knowledge indicates that 'Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure COMPLICATES Shock,' which supports the association of shock with a form of hypoxia where oxygen levels in the blood are inadequate. This aligns with the definition of hypoxic hypoxia, making it the most appropriate choice.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opc\",\n    \"confidence\": 90\n}",
