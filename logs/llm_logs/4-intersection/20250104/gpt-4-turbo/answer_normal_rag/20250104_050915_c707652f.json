  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Spironolactone is a potassium-sparing diuretic that acts as an aldosterone receptor antagonist. It is commonly used in conditions like heart failure, hypertension, and conditions with excessive aldosterone production. One of the known risks of using spironolactone is hyperkalemia (high potassium levels), which can be dangerous and lead to cardiac complications. ACE inhibitors, which are also used to manage hypertension and heart failure, similarly increase potassium levels in the blood. The concurrent use of spironolactone with ACE inhibitors can further increase the risk of hyperkalemia, making this combination potentially unsafe without careful monitoring. The other options, including chlorothiazide (a thiazide diuretic), beta blockers, and amlodipine (a calcium channel blocker), do not have a direct contraindication with spironolactone regarding potassium levels, although individual patient factors always need consideration.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opc\",\n    \"confidence\": 90\n}",
