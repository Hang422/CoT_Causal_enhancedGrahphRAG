Which of the following drug might be responsible for the condition:\n\n    Options:\n    opa. Diuretics\nopb. ACE inhibitors\nopc. Calcium channel blockers\nopd. Beta blockers\n\n### Retrieved Similar Medical Knowledge:\n- Microscopy, Video DIAGNOSES Venous occlusion\n- Therapies, Investigational TREATS Pityriasis Lichenoides\n- Calcium Channel Blockers PREVENTS Coughing\n- latanoprost TREATS Macular Edema, Cystoid\n- Microglia INTERACTS_WITH Mineralocorticoid Receptor\n- Troponin INTERACTS_WITH Myocytes, Cardiac\n\n    ### Instructions:\n            - Use standard medical knowledge as the primary guide.\n            - Consider enhanced information only if it aligns with consensus.\n            - If conflicting or unclear, present the most likely correct answer based on known facts.\n            - It's acceptable to show moderate confidence if the question is complex, but still choose one best answer.\n    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3.

  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Among the listed options, ACE inhibitors are well-known to cause a dry cough as a side effect. This is a common reason for patients to switch to other antihypertensive medications. The retrieved medical knowledge does not directly address the side effects of ACE inhibitors, but standard medical knowledge strongly supports this association. Diuretics, calcium channel blockers, and beta blockers do not typically cause dry cough as a prominent side effect.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opb\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}",
