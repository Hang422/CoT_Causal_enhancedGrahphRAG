  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Tamoxifen is known to have several adverse effects due to its action as a selective estrogen receptor modulator. Among the listed options, thromboembolism and endometrial carcinoma are well-documented side effects of tamoxifen. Cataracts have also been reported as a potential side effect in some patients. However, tamoxifen is actually used to reduce the risk of carcinoma in the contralateral (opposite) breast in patients with breast cancer, which is a beneficial effect rather than an adverse one. Therefore, the option stating that tamoxifen causes carcinoma in the contralateral breast is incorrect.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opc\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}",
