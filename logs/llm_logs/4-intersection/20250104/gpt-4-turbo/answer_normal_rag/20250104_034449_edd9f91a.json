  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Based on the retrieved medical knowledge, Tamoxifen is noted to cause endometrial hyperplasia. This aligns with standard pharmacological understanding where Tamoxifen, a selective estrogen receptor modulator, has a known side effect of causing endometrial hyperplasia due to its estrogenic effects on the uterine lining. The other options do not align as closely with the known effects of Tamoxifen. For instance, Tamoxifen is used to treat, not cause, hyperlipidemia (including high triglyceride levels), and there is no direct evidence linking it with causing osteoporosis or ovarian cancer in the retrieved data.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opb\",\n    \"confidence\": 90\n}",
