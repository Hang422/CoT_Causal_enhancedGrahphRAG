  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Dobutamine and dopamine are both inotropic agents used in medical settings but have different receptor activity profiles. Dobutamine primarily acts on beta-1 adrenergic receptors, leading to increased cardiac output with less pronounced effects on heart rate and blood pressure compared to dopamine. Dopamine affects both dopaminergic and beta-adrenergic receptors and can influence various physiological responses, including increased heart rate (tachycardia). The key difference between dobutamine and dopamine lies in their receptor activity. Dobutamine does not significantly activate peripheral dopaminergic receptors, which is a distinct pharmacological property compared to dopamine. This difference is crucial in their clinical applications, as dobutamine is preferred in cases where beta-1 adrenergic receptor stimulation is desired without the dopaminergic effects that dopamine would provide.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opd\",\n    \"confidence\": 90\n}",
