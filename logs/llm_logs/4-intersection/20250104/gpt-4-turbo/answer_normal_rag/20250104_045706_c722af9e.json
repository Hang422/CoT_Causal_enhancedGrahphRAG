  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Heparin is a well-known anticoagulant used in various medical settings, including cardiac surgery. It primarily works by activating antithrombin, which then inhibits thrombin and factor Xa, crucial steps in the coagulation cascade. This mechanism is well-documented and aligns with option 'opc'. Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia is a recognized complication of heparin therapy, supporting the validity of option 'opd'. Regarding the source of commercial heparin, it is indeed primarily derived from pig intestinal mucosa, which confirms the accuracy of option 'opb'. However, the statement in option 'opa' that heparin is the 'weakest acid found in living things' is incorrect. Heparin is a sulfated glycosaminoglycan, and while it is acidic due to its sulfate groups, the claim of it being the 'weakest acid' is not substantiated in scientific literature or common pharmacological knowledge.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opa\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}",
