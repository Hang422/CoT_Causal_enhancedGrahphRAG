  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Among the options provided, Vitamin K is known to function as a coenzyme in the carboxylation of glutamic acid residues on proteins, which is essential for blood clotting. This is a well-established role of Vitamin K in biochemistry. The other vitamins listed (Vitamin A, Vitamin E, and Vitamin D) do not typically serve as coenzymes in enzymatic reactions. Vitamin A is primarily involved in vision and cellular growth, Vitamin E acts as an antioxidant, and Vitamin D is crucial for calcium homeostasis and bone health. Therefore, based on standard medical knowledge, Vitamin K is the correct answer.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opb\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}",
