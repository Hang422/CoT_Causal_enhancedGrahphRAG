  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"INH (isoniazid) induced neuropathy is a well-known side effect of the tuberculosis medication isoniazid. This type of neuropathy is typically treated with pyridoxine (vitamin B6) supplementation to prevent or alleviate symptoms. The retrieved medical knowledge confirms that pyridoxine treats peripheral neuropathy, which aligns with the standard treatment protocol for INH-induced neuropathy. Other options such as thiamine, niacin, and riboflavin, although associated with neuropathy treatment or effects, do not specifically target INH-induced neuropathy as effectively as pyridoxine.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opb\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}",
