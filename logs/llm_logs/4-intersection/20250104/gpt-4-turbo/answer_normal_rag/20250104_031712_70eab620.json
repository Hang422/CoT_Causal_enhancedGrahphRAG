  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Fibrinolytic drugs, used in the treatment of acute myocardial infarction, primarily work by dissolving blood clots to restore blood flow. A known and significant adverse effect of these agents is bleeding due to the breakdown of clots throughout the body, not just at the site of the occlusion. This systemic effect can lead to hemorrhagic events, including hemorrhagic stroke, which is a severe form of bleeding in the brain. The other options, such as acute renal failure, development of antiplatelet antibodies, and encephalitis secondary to liver dysfunction, are not directly associated with the typical adverse effects of fibrinolytics. Therefore, based on the mechanism of action of fibrinolytic drugs and their known side effects, hemorrhagic stroke is the most likely adverse effect.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opd\",\n    \"confidence\": 90\n}",
