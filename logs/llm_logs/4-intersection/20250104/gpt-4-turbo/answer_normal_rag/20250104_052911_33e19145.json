  "response": "```json\n{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Based on the retrieved medical knowledge, Adenosine deaminase deficiency is known to cause severe combined immunodeficiency, which is a significant and well-documented condition. The enzyme replacement therapy for this deficiency further supports the critical role of adenosine deaminase in immune function. The other options, while associated with different metabolic or genetic disorders, do not directly link to a well-defined immunodeficiency or severe disease in the context provided. Therefore, adenosine deaminase deficiency is the most likely correct answer given its direct association with a severe and treatable condition.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opb\",\n    \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
