  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Cholesterol is transported from the liver to peripheral tissues primarily by lipoproteins. Among the options provided, LDL (Low-Density Lipoprotein) is the primary carrier responsible for the delivery of cholesterol to peripheral tissues. LDL is known to transport cholesterol released from the liver into the bloodstream to various parts of the body where it is used in cell membrane structure, hormone synthesis, and other critical functions. VLDL (Very Low-Density Lipoprotein) primarily carries triglycerides from the liver, and while it does carry some cholesterol, its primary role is not the direct delivery of cholesterol to peripheral tissues. HDL (High-Density Lipoprotein) is mainly involved in reverse cholesterol transport, carrying cholesterol away from the tissues back to the liver. Chylomicrons primarily transport dietary lipids from the intestines to other parts of the body. Therefore, based on standard medical knowledge, LDL is the correct answer.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opb\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}",
