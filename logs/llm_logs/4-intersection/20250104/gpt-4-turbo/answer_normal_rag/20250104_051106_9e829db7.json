Streptomycin\nopb. Ethambutol\nopc. Capreomycin\nopd. Rifampicin\n\n### Retrieved Similar Medical Knowledge:\n- Antitubercular Agents TREATS Kidney Failure, Acute\n- Antitubercular Agents TREATS Kidney Failure\n- Migraine Variant ISA Headache\n- Clipping TREATS Vasospasm\n- Antitubercular Agents TREATS Renal Insufficiency\n\n    ### Instructions:\n            - Use standard medical knowledge as the primary guide.\n            - Consider enhanced information only if it aligns with consensus.\n            - If conflicting or unclear, present the most likely correct answer based on known facts.\n            - It's acceptable to show moderate confidence if the question is complex, but still choose one best answer.\n    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n                \n    ### Output Format\n    Provide your response in valid JSON format:\n    {   \n        \"final_analysis\": \"Your analysis of how the retrieved relationships support the answer\",\n        \"answer\": \"Option key from the available options (only key, like opa)\",\n        \"confidence\": Score between 0-100 based on evidence strength and relevance\n    }\n    "

  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Among the listed antitubercular drugs, Rifampicin is known to be safer for use in patients with severe renal failure. Streptomycin and Capreomycin are both aminoglycosides, which are generally avoided in renal failure due to their nephrotoxic potential. Ethambutol's dosing needs to be adjusted in renal failure to prevent toxicity. Rifampicin, however, is primarily metabolized by the liver, and its pharmacokinetics are less affected by renal function, making it a safer choice in patients with severe renal impairment.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opd\",\n    \"confidence\": 90\n}",
