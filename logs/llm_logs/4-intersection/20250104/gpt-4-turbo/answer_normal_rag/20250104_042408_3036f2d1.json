  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"L-Dopa is combined with carbidopa in the treatment of parkinsonism primarily to inhibit the peripheral conversion of levodopa to dopamine. This is crucial because it allows more levodopa to reach the brain where it can be converted into dopamine, which is deficient in Parkinson's disease. Carbidopa acts by inhibiting the enzyme aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) in the peripheral tissues, thereby preventing the premature conversion of levodopa to dopamine outside the brain. This mechanism does not directly inhibit the conversion of levodopa to dopamine in the CNS, but rather ensures that more levodopa is available to be transported into the CNS where it can be effectively converted to dopamine. Therefore, the correct answer is that it is used to decrease the dose of levodopa required, as more levodopa is available to cross the blood-brain barrier due to reduced peripheral conversion.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opc\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}",
