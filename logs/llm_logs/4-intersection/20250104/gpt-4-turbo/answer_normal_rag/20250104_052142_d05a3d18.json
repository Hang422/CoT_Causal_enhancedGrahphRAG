  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Testosterone is primarily produced by the Leydig cells, which are located in the interstitial space of the testes. The retrieved medical knowledge confirms the interaction between 11-beta-Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenases and the structure of interstitial cell of Leydig, supporting the role of Leydig cells in steroid hormone (including testosterone) production. Although testosterone is mentioned as part of the epididymis, this likely refers to its role or presence there rather than its site of production. The other options, such as Sertoli cells and seminiferous tubules, are more involved in supporting spermatogenesis rather than the production of testosterone.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opa\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}",
