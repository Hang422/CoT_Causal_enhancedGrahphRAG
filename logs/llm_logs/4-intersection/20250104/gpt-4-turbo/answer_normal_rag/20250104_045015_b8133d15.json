Striated\nopb. Large T tubules\nopc. Troponin system present\nopd. Caldesmon is impoant regulatory protein\n\n### Retrieved Similar Medical Knowledge:\n- Muscle PART_OF Heart\n- Udder LOCATION_OF Chronic tuberculosis\n- Muscle Cells INTERACTS_WITH Troponin\n- Troponin C INTERACTS_WITH Muscle Fibers\n- Gallbladder LOCATION_OF Hematoma\n- Myocytes, Cardiac LOCATION_OF Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids\n- Lipids PART_OF Neurons\n- Virion PART_OF Rauscher murine leukemia virus\n- Depressive disorder ISA Neurotic Disorders\n\n    ### Instructions:\n            - Use standard medical knowledge as the primary guide.\n            - Consider enhanced information only if it aligns with consensus.\n            - If conflicting or unclear, present the most likely correct answer based on known facts.\n            - It's acceptable to show moderate confidence if the question is complex, but still choose one best answer.\n    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3.

  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Cardiac muscle is known for being striated (opa), having a troponin system present (opc), and having relatively large T tubules (opb) compared to skeletal muscle. However, caldesmon is not a regulatory protein typically associated with cardiac muscle; it is more relevant in smooth muscle regulation. The retrieved medical knowledge confirms the presence and interaction of troponin with muscle fibers, supporting the typical features of cardiac muscle but does not mention caldesmon, aligning with standard medical consensus.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opd\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}",
