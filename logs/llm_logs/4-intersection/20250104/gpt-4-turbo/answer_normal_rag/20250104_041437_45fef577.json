  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Among the options provided, Propanolol, Alprazolam, and Buspirone are known to be used in the treatment of anxiety. Propanolol, although primarily a beta-blocker used for heart conditions, is also used off-label for anxiety, particularly for performance anxiety by reducing physical symptoms. Alprazolam is a well-known benzodiazepine used specifically for anxiety disorders. Buspirone is an anxiolytic specifically designed to treat anxiety. Haloperidol, on the other hand, is primarily an antipsychotic used for schizophrenia and acute psychosis and is not typically used for treating anxiety disorders. Therefore, Haloperidol is the correct answer as it is not used for anxiety.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opd\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}",
