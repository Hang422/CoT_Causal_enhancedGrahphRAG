  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Pseudotumor cerebri, also known as idiopathic intracranial hypertension, is a condition characterized by increased intracranial pressure without an obvious cause. Among the drugs listed, tetracycline is known to be associated with the development of pseudotumor cerebri. This association is well-documented in medical literature, indicating that tetracycline can lead to increased intracranial pressure, mimicking symptoms of a brain tumor. The other drugs listed (sparfloxacin, gentamicin, and clofazimine) do not have a widely recognized link with pseudotumor cerebri based on standard medical knowledge.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opb\",\n    \"confidence\": 90\n}",
