  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Chlorpropamide is known to treat Diabetes Mellitus as indicated in the retrieved medical knowledge. Additionally, Chlorpropamide has a unique property among sulfonylureas, as it can also reduce urine output in some patients with diabetes insipidus. This dual functionality is not commonly associated with other sulfonylureas like Glibenclamide, Glicazide, or Glipizide, which are primarily used for the treatment of diabetes mellitus only. Therefore, based on the standard medical knowledge and the specific properties of Chlorpropamide, it is the most likely correct answer.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opa\",\n    \"confidence\": 85\n}",
