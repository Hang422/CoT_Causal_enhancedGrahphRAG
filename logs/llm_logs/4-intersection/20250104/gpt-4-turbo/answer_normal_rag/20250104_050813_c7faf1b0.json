  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Pulmonary fibrosis is a known complication associated with certain drugs, particularly those used in chemotherapy and immunosuppressive therapies. Among the options provided, Busulfan is a well-documented cause of pulmonary fibrosis. Busulfan is an alkylating agent used primarily in bone marrow transplantation conditioning regimens. Its association with pulmonary fibrosis is recognized in medical literature and clinical practice, making it the most likely correct answer based on standard pharmacological knowledge. The other drugs listed (Methotrexate, Doxorubicin, Cisplatin) also have side effects, but their direct association with pulmonary fibrosis is not as strongly established as with Busulfan.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opd\",\n    \"confidence\": 90\n}",
