  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Cholestyramine, a bile acid sequestrant, is known to interact with digoxin by reducing its absorption and thus its effectiveness. Thiazide diuretics can increase the risk of digoxin toxicity by causing electrolyte imbalances, particularly hypokalemia. Quinidine is well-documented to increase digoxin levels by reducing its clearance and increasing its serum concentration. Amlodipine, however, primarily affects calcium channels and has minimal direct interaction with digoxin's pharmacokinetics or dynamics. Therefore, among the options provided, amlodipine is the least likely to have significant drug interactions with digoxin.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opd\",\n    \"confidence\": 90\n}",
