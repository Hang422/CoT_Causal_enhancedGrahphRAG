  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"The drug of choice for pneumonia caused by Pneumocystis carinii (now known as Pneumocystis jirovecii) is typically Trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole, which is a combination drug also known as Cotrimoxazole. This is supported by the retrieved medical knowledge indicating that Trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole treats pneumonia caused by Pneumocystis carinii. None of the other options listed (Penicillin, Kanamycin, Levofloxacin) are standard treatments for this specific type of pneumonia. Levofloxacin is indeed used for other types of pneumonia but not specifically for Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opb\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}",
