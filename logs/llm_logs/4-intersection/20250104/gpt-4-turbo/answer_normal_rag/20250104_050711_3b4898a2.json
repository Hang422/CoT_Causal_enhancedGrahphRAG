  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Steroids are commonly used in the treatment of various complications of tuberculosis that involve inflammation, such as meningitis and pericarditis, where they help reduce inflammation and prevent complications. The use of steroids in adrenal involvement due to tuberculosis is also indicated due to their role in managing adrenal insufficiency which can result from tuberculosis affecting the adrenal glands. However, the use of steroids in ileo-caecal tuberculosis, which primarily involves the gastrointestinal tract, is not typically indicated as the primary treatment focus here is on controlling the infection with anti-tuberculosis therapy rather than inflammation. Therefore, steroids are less likely to be beneficial in ileo-caecal tuberculosis compared to the other options listed.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opc\",\n    \"confidence\": 85\n}",
