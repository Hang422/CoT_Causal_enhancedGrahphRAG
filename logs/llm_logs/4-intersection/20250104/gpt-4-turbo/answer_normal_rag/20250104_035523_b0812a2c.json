Hydrochlorothiazide\n\n### Retrieved Similar Medical Knowledge:\n- Diuretics TREATS Heart failure\n- Electric Countershock COMPLICATES Heart failure\n- Diuretics PREDISPOSES Thiamine Deficiency\n- Diuretics COMPLICATES Congestive heart failure\n- Diuretic therapy COMPLICATES Heart failure\n- Furosemide ASSOCIATED_WITH Heart failure\n- Zidovudine TREATS Cryptosporidiosis\n\n    ### Instructions:\n            - Use standard medical knowledge as the primary guide.\n            - Consider enhanced information only if it aligns with consensus.\n            - If conflicting or unclear, present the most likely correct answer based on known facts.\n            - It's acceptable to show moderate confidence if the question is complex, but still choose one best answer.\n    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3.

  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Mannitol, a type of osmotic diuretic, is generally contraindicated in patients with severe heart failure due to its potential to exacerbate the condition by causing rapid shifts in fluid balance, which can lead to pulmonary edema or worsening of heart failure. While diuretics like spironolactone, furosemide, and hydrochlorothiazide are commonly used to manage fluid overload in heart failure, mannitol's specific mechanism and effects make it less suitable in this context. The retrieved medical knowledge does not directly address mannitol, but standard medical practice and pharmacological understanding support the contraindication of mannitol in cardiac failure.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opa\",\n    \"confidence\": 85\n}",
