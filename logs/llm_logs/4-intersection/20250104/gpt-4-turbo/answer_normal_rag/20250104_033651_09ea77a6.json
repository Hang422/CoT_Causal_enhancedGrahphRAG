  "response": "```json\n{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Protease activated receptors (PARs) are indeed a family of receptors, but they are not limited to three members; there are four known PARs (PAR1, PAR2, PAR3, and PAR4). They are activated by serine proteases such as thrombin and can lead to various cellular responses, including the release of prostaglandins like PGE2, which is involved in inflammation and pain among other functions. PARs also play roles in protecting epithelial cells by maintaining barrier function and regulating inflammation. Therefore, the statement that there are only three members in the family of protease activated receptors is incorrect.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opa\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
