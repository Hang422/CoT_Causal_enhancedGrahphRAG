Drug implicated is?\n\n    Options:\n    opa. Streptomycin\nopb. Isoniazid\nopc. Ethambutol\nopd. Rifampicin\n\n### Retrieved Similar Medical Knowledge:\n- Antibiotic therapy PREDISPOSES Tinnitus\n- Streptomycin ASSOCIATED_WITH Deafness\n- Tuberculosis, Multidrug-Resistant CAUSES Ototoxicity\n- Aminoglycosides COMPLICATES Deafness\n- Cervical spine LOCATION_OF Puncture biopsy\n- Structure of lamina vasculosa of choroid LOCATION_OF Medical Imaging\n- bevacizumab TREATS Hyperbilirubinemia\n- Optical filter ISA Filters\n\n    ### Instructions:\n            - Use standard medical knowledge as the primary guide.\n            - Consider enhanced information only if it aligns with consensus.\n            - If conflicting or unclear, present the most likely correct answer based on known facts.\n            - It's acceptable to show moderate confidence if the question is complex, but still choose one best answer.\n    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3.

  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"The retrieved medical knowledge indicates that Streptomycin is associated with deafness. Streptomycin is an aminoglycoside antibiotic, and aminoglycosides are known to cause ototoxicity, which can manifest as deafness and tinnitus. The other drugs listed (Isoniazid, Ethambutol, Rifampicin) are also used in the treatment of tuberculosis but are not primarily known for causing ototoxic effects like deafness and tinnitus. Therefore, based on the consensus in medical literature and the specific association of Streptomycin with deafness, Streptomycin is the most likely drug implicated in the patient's symptoms.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opa\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}",
