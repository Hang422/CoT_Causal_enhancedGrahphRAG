  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Enzymatic markers of the plasma membrane typically include enzymes that are integral to the membrane structure or function. 5'-nucleotidase, adenylyl cyclase, and Na+-K+-ATPase are known to be associated with the plasma membrane, playing roles in signal transduction, ion transport, and other membrane-related functions. Galactosyl transferase, while an enzyme involved in the transfer of galactose in glycoprotein and glycolipid synthesis, is more typically associated with the Golgi apparatus rather than the plasma membrane. Therefore, it does not fit as a typical enzymatic marker of the plasma membrane compared to the other options listed.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opd\",\n    \"confidence\": 90\n}",
