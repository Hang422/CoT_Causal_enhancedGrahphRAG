  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"The drug of choice for treating Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is typically a stimulant medication, with methylphenidate being one of the most commonly prescribed. This is supported by the retrieved medical knowledge indicating that methylphenidate treats Attention Deficit Disorder, which is closely related to ADHD. Other options such as imipramine and benzodiazepines (like alprazolam) are also noted to treat ADHD, but they are generally considered secondary options or used for different profiles of symptoms. Haloperidol, an antipsychotic, is not typically used for ADHD and is more appropriate for other psychiatric conditions. Therefore, based on the consensus in medical guidelines and the evidence provided, methylphenidate is the most appropriate choice.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opd\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}",
