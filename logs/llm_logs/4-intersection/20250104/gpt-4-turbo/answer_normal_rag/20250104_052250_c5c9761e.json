  "response": "```json\n{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Salbutamol is a well-known beta adrenergic agonist used in the treatment of bronchial asthma, primarily through inhalation as an aerosol. This aligns with the retrieved medical knowledge that adrenergic agonists are used to treat asthma. The other options, such as Ketotifen, Fluticasone, and Montelukast, have different mechanisms of action and are not classified as beta adrenergic agonists. Ketotifen is an antihistamine used more for prophylaxis of asthma, Fluticasone is a corticosteroid, and Montelukast is a leukotriene receptor antagonist.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opa\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
