Vitamin A\nopb. Vitamin C\nopc. Vitamin D\nopd. Vitamin B12\n\n### Retrieved Similar Medical Knowledge:\n- Vertebral column LOCATION_OF Seizures\n- Sensory denervation disorder ASSOCIATED_WITH Trigemino-sympathetic syndrome\n- Vitamin D PREVENTS Metabolic syndrome\n- Kidney LOCATION_OF BK Virus\n- Vitamin supplementation PREVENTS Insulin Resistance\n- Estradiol PART_OF Muscle Fibers\n- Vitamin A ASSOCIATED_WITH insulin sensitivity\n- Vitamin A TREATS Metabolic syndrome\n- vitamin B12 TREATS Metabolic Diseases\n\n    ### Instructions:\n            - Use standard medical knowledge as the primary guide.\n            - Consider enhanced information only if it aligns with consensus.\n            - If conflicting or unclear, present the most likely correct answer based on known facts.\n            - It's acceptable to show moderate confidence if the question is complex, but still choose one best answer.\n    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3.

  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"The retrieved medical knowledge indicates that Vitamin D prevents metabolic syndrome and vitamin supplementation prevents insulin resistance. Although Vitamin A is associated with insulin sensitivity and treats metabolic syndrome, the specific mention of Vitamin D in preventing metabolic syndrome aligns more directly with the question's focus on reducing the risk of insulin resistance, obesity, and metabolic syndrome. Vitamin B12 is noted to treat metabolic diseases, but this does not specifically align with prevention or reduction of risk as directly as Vitamin D does in the context of metabolic syndrome.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opc\",\n    \"confidence\": 85\n}",
