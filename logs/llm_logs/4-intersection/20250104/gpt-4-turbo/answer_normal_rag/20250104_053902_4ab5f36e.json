  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"The question asks for a 5α reductase inhibitor effective in treating both benign prostatic hypertrophy and male pattern baldness. From the retrieved medical knowledge, it is evident that Finasteride is a 5-alpha reductase inhibitor that prevents prostatic hypertrophy. Additionally, it is well-known in standard medical knowledge that Finasteride is also used to treat male pattern baldness. The other options provided do not align with the treatment of both conditions as specified in the question. Flutamide is an antiandrogen but not a 5-alpha reductase inhibitor, Prazosin is an alpha-blocker used for hypertension and benign prostatic hyperplasia but not for male pattern baldness, and Minoxidil is primarily used for hypertension and topically for hair growth but does not inhibit 5-alpha reductase.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opb\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}",
