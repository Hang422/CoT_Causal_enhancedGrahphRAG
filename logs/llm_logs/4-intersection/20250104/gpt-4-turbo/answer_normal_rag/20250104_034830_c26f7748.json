  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Based on the retrieved medical knowledge, Clonazepam is specifically mentioned as a treatment for Myoclonus and Myoclonic Epilepsies. This aligns with standard pharmacological treatments for myoclonic disorders, where Clonazepam is commonly used due to its efficacy in controlling seizures, including myoclonic types. Although Sodium Valproate and Phenobarbital are also used in the management of myoclonic seizures, the direct mention of Clonazepam treating Myoclonus provides a stronger basis for its selection. Ethosuximide, while used in absence seizures, is not typically preferred for myoclonus, making it a less suitable option in this context.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opa\",\n    \"confidence\": 90\n}",
