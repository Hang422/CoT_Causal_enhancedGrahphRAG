  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"The patient's complaint of increased breast size, known medically as gynecomastia, can be a side effect of certain medications. Among the listed options, Spironolactone is known to potentially cause gynecomastia due to its anti-androgenic effects. Captopril, Furosemide, and Hydrochlorothiazide are primarily used for hypertension but are not commonly associated with gynecomastia as a side effect. Therefore, based on the standard medical knowledge and the side effect profiles of the medications listed, Spironolactone is the most likely cause of the patient's symptoms.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opd\",\n    \"confidence\": 90\n}",
