  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Cisplatin is known to cause several adverse effects including ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity, as indicated in the retrieved medical knowledge. Ototoxicity refers to ear toxicity which can lead to hearing loss, and nephrotoxicity refers to kidney damage, both of which are well-documented side effects of cisplatin. The 'coasting effect' is also associated with cisplatin, describing a phenomenon where certain side effects, particularly neurotoxicity, may continue to worsen even after cessation of the drug. However, there is no direct evidence linking cisplatin with pulmonary fibrosis. While cytotoxic chemotherapy in general can cause pulmonary fibrosis, the specific association of cisplatin with this condition is not supported by the retrieved data or standard medical knowledge.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opd\",\n    \"confidence\": 90\n}",
