  "response": "```json\n{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"The retrieved medical knowledge indicates that Interferon beta (Beta IFN) is used to treat Multiple Sclerosis, specifically the relapsing-remitting form. This aligns with standard medical guidelines that commonly prescribe Beta IFN as a first-line treatment for this condition due to its efficacy in reducing the frequency and severity of relapses. Natalizumab is also noted to treat multiple sclerosis relapses, but it is generally reserved for cases where other treatments have failed or are contraindicated due to its higher risk of serious side effects, such as progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy. Therefore, based on the consensus and safety profile, Beta IFN is the more appropriate choice as the drug of choice for relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opb\",\n    \"confidence\": 90\n}\n```",
