  "response": "```json\n{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Chloroquine is primarily known for its use in treating malaria and certain autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis. The retrieved medical knowledge confirms that chloroquine is used to treat virus diseases and communicable diseases, which aligns with its known antiviral properties. However, there is no direct evidence in the retrieved data linking chloroquine to the treatment of discoid lupus erythematosus or infectious mononucleosis. Chloromycetin, not chloroquine, is specifically mentioned as a treatment for infectious mononucleosis. Therefore, the best-supported option based on the available data and standard medical knowledge is that chloroquine is useful in treating rheumatoid arthritis.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opb\",\n    \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
