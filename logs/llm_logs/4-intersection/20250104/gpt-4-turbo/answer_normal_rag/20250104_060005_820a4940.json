  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Loop diuretics are indeed known as 'high ceiling' diuretics due to their ability to cause a significant increase in urine output, which aligns with option 'opa'. They act on the Na+.K+.2Cl- symporter in the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle, which supports option 'opb'. Loop diuretics are also known to cause hyperuricemia, as indicated by the retrieved medical knowledge, supporting option 'opc'. However, loop diuretics typically lead to hypocalcemia, not hypercalcemia, by increasing calcium excretion in the urine. This contradicts option 'opd', making it the incorrect statement among the options provided.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opd\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}",
