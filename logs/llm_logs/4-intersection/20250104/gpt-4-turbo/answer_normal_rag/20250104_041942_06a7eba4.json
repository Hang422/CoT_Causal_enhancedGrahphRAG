  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"The fluidity of the plasma membrane is influenced by the types of fatty acids and other lipid molecules present. Arachidonic acid, being an unsaturated fatty acid, has kinks in its structure due to double bonds, which prevent the fatty acid chains from packing tightly together, thus increasing membrane fluidity. Cholesterol, on the other hand, is known to both stabilize membrane structure and decrease fluidity at higher concentrations. Palmitic acid and stearic acid are saturated fatty acids, which typically increase membrane rigidity due to their straight chains that pack closely together. Based on standard physiological knowledge, unsaturated fatty acids like arachidonic acid are more likely to increase membrane fluidity compared to saturated fatty acids or cholesterol.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opa\",\n    \"confidence\": 85\n}",
