  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Gp2b3A inhibitors, also known as GPIIb/IIIa inhibitors, are a class of antiplatelet medications used to prevent platelet aggregation and thrombus formation. Abciximab, eptifibatide, and tirofiban are well-known GPIIb/IIIa inhibitors. Prasugrel, on the other hand, is a thienopyridine class antiplatelet agent, which works by inhibiting the P2Y12 adenosine diphosphate receptor on the platelet surface, not GPIIb/IIIa. Therefore, Prasugrel does not belong to the Gp2b3A inhibitor class but rather acts through a different mechanism.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opd\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}",
