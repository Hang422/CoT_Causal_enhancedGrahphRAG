  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"The hormone responsible for causing uterine contractions during labor and delivery is oxytocin. Oxytocin is known to be produced in the hypothalamus and stored and secreted by the posterior pituitary gland. The retrieved medical knowledge does not directly address the production site of oxytocin or its role in labor, but standard medical knowledge clearly identifies the posterior pituitary as the site of oxytocin release. Therefore, the correct answer is based on well-established medical consensus.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opc\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}",
