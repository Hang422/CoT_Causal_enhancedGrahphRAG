  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"The question pertains to the secretions of Sertoli cells, which are located in the seminiferous tubules of the testis. Sertoli cells are known to secrete several substances important for sperm development and maturation. Among the options provided, Androgen Binding Protein (ABP) and Testosterone are relevant to the function of Sertoli cells. However, Sertoli cells primarily secrete Androgen Binding Protein, which binds to testosterone, increasing its concentration in the seminiferous tubules and thereby facilitating spermatogenesis. Testosterone itself is primarily produced by the Leydig cells, not Sertoli cells. LH (Luteinizing Hormone) and FSH (Follicle Stimulating Hormone) are secreted by the pituitary gland, not by Sertoli cells. Therefore, the correct answer is Androgen Binding Protein.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opa\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}",
