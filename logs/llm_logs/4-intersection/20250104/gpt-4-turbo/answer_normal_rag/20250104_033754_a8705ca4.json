  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Cholecystokinin (CCK) is a well-known gastrointestinal hormone with multiple physiological roles. According to standard medical knowledge, CCK is primarily involved in stimulating the contraction of the gallbladder to facilitate bile release, which aids in digestion. Additionally, CCK stimulates the secretion of enzyme-rich pancreatic juice, which is crucial for the digestion of fats, proteins, and carbohydrates. The retrieved medical knowledge confirms the association of CCK with contraction, which supports its role in gallbladder contraction. There is no direct evidence in the retrieved data about CCK increasing the secretion of enterokinase or being the sole factor for all listed actions, although it does interact broadly with digestive processes. Based on this, the most comprehensive and supported answer is that CCK is involved in both the contraction of the gallbladder and the secretion of pancreatic enzymes.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opd\",\n    \"confidence\": 85\n}",
