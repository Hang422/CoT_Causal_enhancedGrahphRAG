Fatty acids\nopb. Ketone bodies\nopc. Glucose\nopd. Any of the above\n\n### Retrieved Similar Medical Knowledge:\n- Fixation of fracture using plate TREATS Respiratory Tract Infections\n- Muscle PART_OF Heart\n- ZMPSTE24 INTERACTS_WITH Cells\n- Pharmaceutical Preparations CAUSES Dermatitis, Phototoxic\n- Experimental drug TREATS Psychotic Disorders\n- Glucose ASSOCIATED_WITH Myocardial Ischemia\n- Colon LOCATION_OF Positron-Emission Tomography\n- Energy Metabolism PROCESS_OF Rat Heart\n\n    ### Instructions:\n            - Use standard medical knowledge as the primary guide.\n            - Consider enhanced information only if it aligns with consensus.\n            - If conflicting or unclear, present the most likely correct answer based on known facts.\n            - It's acceptable to show moderate confidence if the question is complex, but still choose one best answer.\n    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3.

  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Cardiac muscle primarily uses fatty acids as its main source of energy under normal conditions. While it can also utilize glucose and ketone bodies, especially under different physiological or pathological conditions, fatty acids remain the predominant energy source. The retrieved medical knowledge does not directly address the specific question but understanding the basic principles of cardiac metabolism and energy utilization supports this conclusion. The heart's ability to adapt its substrate utilization based on availability and demand is well-documented, but under normal, resting conditions, fatty acids are the primary fuel.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opa\",\n    \"confidence\": 85\n}",
