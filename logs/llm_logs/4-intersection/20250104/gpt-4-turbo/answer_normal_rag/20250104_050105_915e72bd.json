  "response": "```json\n{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"The stomach is known to secrete several substances essential for digestion, including hydrochloric acid (HCl) and pepsinogens, which are precursors to the enzyme pepsin that breaks down proteins. Lipase is primarily secreted by the pancreas, although some gastric lipase is also produced by the stomach, particularly important in infants for digesting milk fats. Therefore, all listed options are indeed secreted by the stomach to some extent, making 'None' the correct answer as none of the options are exclusively not secreted by the stomach.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opd\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
