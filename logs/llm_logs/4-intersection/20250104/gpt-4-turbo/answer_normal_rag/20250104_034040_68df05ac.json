  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Aminoglycosides are known to cause sensorineural hearing loss primarily by affecting the cochlear structure. The damage typically occurs in the hair cells of the cochlea, which are essential for hearing. The outer hair cells, especially in the basal area of the cochlea, are particularly susceptible to damage from aminoglycosides. This is consistent with the general understanding that the basal turn of the cochlea, which is responsible for high-frequency sound processing, is often the first to exhibit damage due to ototoxic substances like aminoglycosides.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opa\",\n    \"confidence\": 85\n}",
