  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"The question asks which enzyme deficiency does not commonly feature hyperammonemia. Hyperammonemia is typically associated with defects in the urea cycle, which is responsible for the detoxification of ammonia. Argininosuccinate synthetase, Carbamoyl Phosphate Synthetase (CPS-I), and Ornithine Transcarbamoylase (OTC) are all enzymes involved in the urea cycle, and deficiencies in these enzymes can lead to hyperammonemia. However, Ornithine Amino Transferase (opd) is involved in the ornithine degradation pathway, not directly in the urea cycle, and its deficiency leads to gyrate atrophy of the choroid and retina but not typically to hyperammonemia. Therefore, based on standard medical knowledge, Ornithine Amino Transferase deficiency is the correct answer as it is not commonly associated with hyperammonemia.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opd\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}",
