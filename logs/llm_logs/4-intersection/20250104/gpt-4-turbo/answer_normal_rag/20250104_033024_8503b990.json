  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Fosphenytoin is a prodrug of phenytoin, primarily used for its ability to be administered intravenously or intramuscularly, which is useful in emergency settings for rapid control of seizures. Both fosphenytoin and phenytoin are used to treat seizures, but not specifically indicated for absence or myoclonic seizures. The key difference between fosphenytoin and phenytoin lies in their solubility and compatibility with intravenous solutions. Fosphenytoin is more water-soluble and can be mixed with saline, unlike phenytoin, which precipitates in saline and must be mixed with dextrose. This property makes fosphenytoin more versatile and safer for IV use, reducing the risk of venous irritation.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opb\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}",
