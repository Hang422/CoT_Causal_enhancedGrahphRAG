  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"The choice of antithyroid medication during the first trimester of pregnancy is crucial due to the potential teratogenic effects of some drugs. Methimazole and carbimazole are known to be associated with congenital malformations when used during early pregnancy. Propylthiouracil, although not without risks, is generally preferred in the first trimester due to a lower risk of congenital defects compared to methimazole or carbimazole. Perchlorate is not typically used as a first-line treatment for hyperthyroidism in pregnancy. The retrieved medical knowledge supports the use of propylthiouracil as it is not associated with causing maternal hypothyroidism like methimazole and is a safer option during the first trimester.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opb\",\n    \"confidence\": 85\n}",
