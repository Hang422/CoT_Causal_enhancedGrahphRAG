Heparin sulfate\nopb. Protamine sulfate\nopc. Low molecular weight heparin\nopd. Warfarin\n\n### Retrieved Similar Medical Knowledge:\n- Fluoroscopy DIAGNOSES Systemic Scleroderma\n- Point of care ultrasound DIAGNOSES Peritoneal Effusion\n- Cell membrane LOCATION_OF HAS2\n\n    ### Instructions:\n            - Use standard medical knowledge as the primary guide.\n            - Consider enhanced information only if it aligns with consensus.\n            - If conflicting or unclear, present the most likely correct answer based on known facts.\n            - It's acceptable to show moderate confidence if the question is complex, but still choose one best answer.\n    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3.

  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"The question pertains to the selection of an anticoagulant for prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism in patients undergoing cancer surgery. Among the options provided, Low Molecular Weight Heparin (LMWH) is widely recognized and recommended in clinical guidelines for this specific use. It is preferred due to its efficacy, safety profile, and convenience of use compared to other anticoagulants. Heparin sulfate and Warfarin are also anticoagulants, but LMWH is specifically favored in the context of cancer due to better outcomes in these patients. Protamine sulfate is not an anticoagulant but is used to reverse the effects of heparin and is therefore not suitable for prophylaxis. The retrieved medical knowledge does not directly relate to the question, so the decision is based on standard medical consensus.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opc\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}",
