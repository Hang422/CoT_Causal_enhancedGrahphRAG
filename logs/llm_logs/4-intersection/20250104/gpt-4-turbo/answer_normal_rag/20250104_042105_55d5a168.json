  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"The plasma membrane of a cell is linked to the cytoskeleton through various proteins that help maintain cell structure and integrity. Among the options provided, Ankyrin is known to bind to the cytoplasmic domain of integral membrane proteins and link them to the spectrin-actin cytoskeleton, thus playing a crucial role in the stability and organization of the plasma membrane. Spectrin itself is part of the cytoskeleton but does not directly bind the plasma membrane to the cytoskeleton; it rather forms a network that is connected by proteins like ankyrin. Tubulin is a major component of microtubules and not directly involved in binding the plasma membrane to the cytoskeleton in the context given. Laminin is a component of the extracellular matrix and interacts with cells but is not involved in linking the plasma membrane to the cytoskeleton directly.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opb\",\n    \"confidence\": 90\n}",
