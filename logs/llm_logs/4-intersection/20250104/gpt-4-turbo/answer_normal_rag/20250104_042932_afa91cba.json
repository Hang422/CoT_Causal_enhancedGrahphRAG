  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Aldosterone is a hormone known to play a crucial role in the regulation of sodium and potassium levels in the body, primarily by acting on the renal system. It primarily functions at the collecting ducts of the nephron in the kidneys, where it promotes sodium reabsorption and potassium excretion. This action helps in the regulation of blood pressure and fluid balance. The retrieved medical knowledge does not directly specify the site of aldosterone action within the nephron, but standard physiological knowledge confirms that aldosterone's primary site of action is the collecting duct. This aligns with the general understanding in physiology, despite the retrieved information focusing more on pathological associations of aldosterone.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opa\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}",
