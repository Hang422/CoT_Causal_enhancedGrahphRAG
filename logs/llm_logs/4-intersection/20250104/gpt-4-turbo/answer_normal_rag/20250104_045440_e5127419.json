  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Quinine is known to cause a variety of side effects, including cinchonism, which is characterized by symptoms such as tinnitus, headache, nausea, and disturbed vision. However, the specific symptoms mentioned in the question - restlessness and sweating - are more commonly associated with hypoglycemia, a known side effect of quinine, especially when administered intravenously. Hypoglycemia can induce symptoms like sweating, restlessness, shaking, and confusion. The retrieved medical knowledge supports the association of hypoglycemic agents causing symptoms, which aligns with the symptoms described. Therefore, hypoglycemia is the most likely cause of the patient's symptoms following i.v. administration of quinine.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opa\",\n    \"confidence\": 85\n}",
