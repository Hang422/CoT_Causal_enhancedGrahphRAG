  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Adrenal insufficiency is characterized by the inability of the adrenal glands to produce adequate amounts of hormones, particularly cortisol and aldosterone. This condition typically leads to hyponatremia (low sodium levels) due to the lack of aldosterone, which helps regulate sodium and water balance. Hyperkalemia (high potassium levels) also occurs because aldosterone normally facilitates the excretion of potassium. Hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) can result from insufficient cortisol, which is involved in glucose metabolism. However, metabolic alkalosis (a condition where the body's pH is elevated) is generally associated with conditions of excess aldosterone, not deficiency. The retrieved medical knowledge supports these associations, indicating that adrenal insufficiency leads to conditions opposite to metabolic alkalosis, such as metabolic acidosis.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opd\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}",
