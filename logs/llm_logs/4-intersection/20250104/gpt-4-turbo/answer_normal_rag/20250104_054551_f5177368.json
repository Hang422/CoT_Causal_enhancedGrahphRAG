  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Vitamin A is a crucial nutrient that plays various roles in the human body. It is known to be involved in vision, immune function, and cellular communication. Vitamin A can be broken down into different biologically active forms, including retinol, retinal, and retinoic acids. Retinol is the alcohol form of vitamin A, important for vision and general health. Retinal, the aldehyde form, is essential in the visual cycle, contributing to vision, particularly in low-light conditions. Retinoic acids, the acid form of vitamin A, are crucial for gene transcription and play a role in cell differentiation and growth. The retrieved medical knowledge confirms the association of Vitamin A with conditions like night blindness and retinal diseases, which are directly related to its functional forms. Therefore, all the mentioned forms of vitamin A are relevant to its function.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opd\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}",
