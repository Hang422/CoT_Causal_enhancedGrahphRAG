  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Depression as a side effect is known to be associated with several medications, but not all. Propranolol, a beta-blocker, has been reported to potentially cause depression in some patients. Reserpine, an antihypertensive medication, is also known to induce depressive symptoms as a side effect. Oral contraceptives have been linked to mood changes and depressive symptoms in some users. Flupenthixol, primarily used as an antipsychotic, does not commonly list depression as a side effect; instead, it is used to treat conditions that include depressive symptoms. Therefore, based on the general consensus and typical medication profiles, Flupenthixol is the least likely to have depression as a side effect among the options provided.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opd\",\n    \"confidence\": 85\n}",
