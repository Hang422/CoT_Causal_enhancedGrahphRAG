  "response": "```json\n{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Enalapril, an ACE inhibitor, is generally contraindicated in pregnancy and in patients with renal artery stenosis due to the risk of further renal impairment and fetal toxicity. It is also not suitable for patients with hyperkalemia as it can increase potassium levels, potentially worsening the condition. However, in diabetic patients, ACE inhibitors like enalapril are beneficial not only for controlling high blood pressure but also for providing renal protection, which is crucial in diabetic nephropathy. Therefore, the best choice among the given options for using enalapril as a first-line agent for hypertension is a diabetic patient.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opd\",\n    \"confidence\": 90\n}\n```",
