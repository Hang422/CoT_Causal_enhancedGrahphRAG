  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"The retrieved medical knowledge indicates that Octreotide is used to treat esophageal varices. This aligns with standard medical practice where Octreotide, a somatostatin analog, is commonly used to reduce bleeding from esophageal varices by lowering portal pressure. Other options such as Ethanolamine oleate and Propranolol have their uses in related contexts but are not the primary drugs of choice for acute management. Phytonadione is primarily used for the treatment of vitamin K deficiency and related bleeding disorders, which is not directly related to esophageal varices.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opb\",\n    \"confidence\": 90\n}",
