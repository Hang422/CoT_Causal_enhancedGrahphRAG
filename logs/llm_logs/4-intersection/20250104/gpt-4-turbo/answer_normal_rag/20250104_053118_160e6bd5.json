  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"ADH (antidiuretic hormone), also known as vasopressin, is primarily secreted in response to low blood volume (hypovolemia) or high blood osmolarity. The retrieved medical knowledge indicates an association between increased vasopressin secretion and hypothalamic nucleus processes, which aligns with the physiological response to hypovolemia where the hypothalamus plays a critical role in detecting changes in blood volume and osmolarity. Hypervolemia and decreased osmolarity typically lead to a decrease in ADH secretion to allow for excretion of excess water, whereas hypertension does not directly influence ADH unless it is related to changes in blood volume or osmolarity.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opc\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}",
