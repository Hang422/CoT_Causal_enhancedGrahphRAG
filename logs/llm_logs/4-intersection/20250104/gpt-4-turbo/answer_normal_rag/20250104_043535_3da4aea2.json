  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Ethambutol is known to cause ocular side effects, particularly affecting the optic nerve, which can lead to retrobulbar neuritis. This condition involves inflammation of the optic nerve that may cause symptoms such as loss of vision or color blindness. The retrieved medical knowledge does not directly link Ethambutol with the other options provided (deafness, red urine, peripheral neuritis). Therefore, based on standard pharmacological knowledge, the most likely side effect of Ethambutol among the given options is retrobulbar neuritis.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opa\",\n    \"confidence\": 90\n}",
