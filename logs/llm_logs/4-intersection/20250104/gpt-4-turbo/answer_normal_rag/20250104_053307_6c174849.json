  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Glycoproteins are proteins that have carbohydrate groups attached to the polypeptide chain. The attachment of carbohydrates to proteins typically involves glycosidic bonds, which is a fundamental characteristic of glycoproteins. The retrieved medical knowledge does not directly address the specific options provided in the question but understanding the basic biochemistry of glycoproteins allows us to determine that glycoproteins indeed involve protein linked with glycosidic bonds. The other options do not universally apply to all glycoproteins or are too vague without additional context (e.g., 'core protein' is a term that could refer to various aspects depending on the specific protein structure and function context).\",\n    \"answer\": \"opa\",\n    \"confidence\": 90\n}",
