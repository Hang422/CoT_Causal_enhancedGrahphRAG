  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"The key consideration in this question is the interaction between anti-tubercular drugs and the antiretroviral therapy regimen. Rifampicin is known to induce the metabolism of many drugs, including antiretrovirals such as indinavir, by inducing cytochrome P450 enzymes. This induction can lead to subtherapeutic levels of indinavir, potentially compromising HIV treatment effectiveness. The other listed drugs (Pyrazinamide, Isoniazid, Ethambutol) do not have such a profound effect on the metabolism of antiretrovirals. Therefore, Rifampicin is typically avoided or used with caution in patients on certain antiretroviral therapies, including those involving indinavir.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opd\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}",
