Leucine\nopb. Lysine\nopc. Methionine\nopd. Proline\n\n### Retrieved Similar Medical Knowledge:\n- Digests ASSOCIATED_WITH Lysine\n- Adenovirus Infections CAUSES Liver damage\n- Muscle LOCATION_OF Adeno-associated virus 3\n- Penicillin prophylaxis TREATS Polyarteritis Nodosa\n- Negative Regulation of Coagulation ASSOCIATED_WITH Amino Acids\n- Choroid LOCATION_OF Laser-Doppler Flowmetry\n- Cranial and facial bones LOCATION_OF Screw\n- Endothelial Cells LOCATION_OF Virulent strain\n\n    ### Instructions:\n            - Use standard medical knowledge as the primary guide.\n            - Consider enhanced information only if it aligns with consensus.\n            - If conflicting or unclear, present the most likely correct answer based on known facts.\n            - It's acceptable to show moderate confidence if the question is complex, but still choose one best answer.\n    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3.

  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"The question asks to identify which among the listed amino acids is not essential. Essential amino acids are those that cannot be synthesized de novo by the organism and must be obtained from the diet. The amino acids listed are Leucine, Lysine, Methionine, and Proline. Among these, Leucine, Lysine, and Methionine are known to be essential amino acids. Proline, however, is not classified as an essential amino acid because it can be synthesized by the human body. Therefore, based on standard biochemical knowledge, Proline is the correct answer as it is not an essential amino acid.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opd\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}",
