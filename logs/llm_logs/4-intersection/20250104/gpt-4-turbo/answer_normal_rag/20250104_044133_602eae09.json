  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Cisapride, a medication previously used for the treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), is known to have the potential to cause QT interval prolongation, which can lead to torsades de pointes, a specific type of ventricular tachycardia. The other medications listed (Famotidine, Lansoprazole, and Metoclopramide) are less commonly associated with this cardiac side effect. Famotidine is an H2 blocker, Lansoprazole is a proton pump inhibitor, and Metoclopramide is primarily used as a prokinetic agent for gastric motility. Among these, Cisapride's association with QT prolongation and subsequent risk for torsades de pointes is well-documented, leading to its restricted use in many countries.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opa\",\n    \"confidence\": 90\n}",
