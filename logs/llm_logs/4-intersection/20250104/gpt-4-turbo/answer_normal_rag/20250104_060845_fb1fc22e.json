  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"The drug of choice for peptic ulcer disease caused by chronic use of NSAIDs should ideally protect the gastric lining and counteract the ulcerogenic effects of NSAIDs. Misoprostol, a prostaglandin analog, is known to decrease gastric acid secretion and increase the production of protective mucus in the stomach, directly addressing the pathophysiology of NSAID-induced peptic ulcers. Esomeprazole, a proton pump inhibitor, while effective in reducing acid production, does not offer the prostaglandin-mediated protective effects on the gastric mucosa that misoprostol does. Pirenzepine and Loratadine are not primarily used for this indication; Pirenzepine is an antimuscarinic agent with more specific applications in peptic ulcer disease not related to NSAIDs, and Loratadine is an antihistamine used for allergic conditions. Therefore, Misoprostol is the most appropriate choice given its mechanism of action and its specific indication for NSAID-induced ulcer prevention.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opc\",\n    \"confidence\": 90\n}",
