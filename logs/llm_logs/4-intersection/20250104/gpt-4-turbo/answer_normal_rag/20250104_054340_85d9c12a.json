  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Epinephrine, when administered intravenously at high doses, is known for its effects on increasing heart rate, causing vasodilation in skeletal muscles, and bronchodilation in the lungs. It also increases liver glycogenolysis to boost glucose levels in response to stress or hypoglycemia. Additionally, high doses of epinephrine can lead to side effects such as restlessness and anxiety due to its action on the central nervous system. However, epinephrine causes bronchodilation, not bronchoconstriction. This is a critical aspect of its use in treating conditions like asthma and other situations where airway constriction is a problem. Therefore, the statement that epinephrine causes bronchiolar constriction is incorrect.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opb\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}",
