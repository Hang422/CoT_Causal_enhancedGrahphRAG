  "response": "```json\n{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Plasmin is primarily known for its role in fibrinolysis, where it breaks down fibrin clots. It also activates various proteases and has a role in tissue remodeling, which could include the activation of collagenase. However, there is no well-established function of plasmin in the stabilization of fibrin; rather, its role is to degrade fibrin. The destruction of von Willebrand factor (VWF) is not a primary known function of plasmin, but it is more plausible compared to the stabilization of fibrin, which is contrary to the fundamental action of plasmin.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opd\",\n    \"confidence\": 90\n}\n```",
