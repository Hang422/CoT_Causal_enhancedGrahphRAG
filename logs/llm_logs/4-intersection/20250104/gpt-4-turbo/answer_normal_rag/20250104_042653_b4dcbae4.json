  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"The question pertains to the absorption of sugars in the intestine, specifically against a concentration gradient. Among the options provided, glucose is well-known to be actively transported into the intestinal cells via specific transport mechanisms, such as the sodium-glucose linked transporter (SGLT), which functions against the concentration gradient. This process is a fundamental aspect of digestive physiology and is widely accepted in medical literature. The other sugars listed (xylose, mannose, ribose) do not have a similar prominent role in active transport against a concentration gradient in the intestine.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opc\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}",
