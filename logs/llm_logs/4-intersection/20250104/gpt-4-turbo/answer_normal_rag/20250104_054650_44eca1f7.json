  "response": "```json\n{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"The question pertains to the use of alpha-1 adrenergic blockers for symptomatic relief in benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Both retrieved medical knowledge entries confirm that adrenergic alpha-1 receptor antagonists are used to treat BPH. Among the options provided, Tamsulosin is a well-known alpha-1 adrenergic blocker specifically used for this purpose, often preferred due to its selectivity for receptors in the prostate which minimizes side effects compared to non-selective blockers. Prazosin, while also an alpha-1 blocker, is more commonly associated with the treatment of hypertension. Oxazocin appears to be a typographical error or a less common drug, as it does not have widely recognized or documented use in BPH treatment in standard medical literature. Dolazoline is not commonly recognized in the context of BPH treatment.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opa\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
