  "response": "```json\n{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Cyclic AMP (cAMP) is a well-known second messenger involved in many biological processes. It primarily functions through the activation of protein kinase A (PKA). When cAMP levels increase, it binds to the regulatory subunits of PKA, causing a conformational change that releases the catalytic subunits. These catalytic subunits then phosphorylate various target proteins, altering their function. This mechanism is a core principle in cell signaling and physiology. The option of activation of adenylate cyclase is incorrect as adenylate cyclase is responsible for the synthesis of cAMP, not its action. The release of Ca2+ is another signaling mechanism but is not directly influenced by cAMP in the context provided.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opa\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
