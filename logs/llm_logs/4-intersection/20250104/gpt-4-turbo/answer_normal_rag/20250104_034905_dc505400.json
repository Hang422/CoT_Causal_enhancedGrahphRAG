  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Imipramine is a tricyclic antidepressant known to be effective in the treatment of nocturnal enuresis, particularly in children. This is a well-established use of imipramine outside its primary indication for depression. The other options, such as Fluvoxamine, Phenelzine, and Bupropion, are primarily used for other types of psychiatric disorders and do not have a recognized use in treating nocturnal enuresis. Therefore, based on standard medical knowledge, Imipramine is the correct answer.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opa\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}",
