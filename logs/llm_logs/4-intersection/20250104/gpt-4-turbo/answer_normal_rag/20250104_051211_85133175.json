  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Hyperprolactinemia is a condition characterized by elevated levels of prolactin in the blood. Among the options provided, Bromocriptine is known to prevent and treat hyperprolactinemia, not cause it. Levodopa and Amantadine are primarily used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease and are not commonly associated with causing hyperprolactinemia. Metoclopramide, however, is a dopamine antagonist used as an antiemetic and for gastroparesis, and it is well-documented in medical literature to cause hyperprolactinemia as a side effect by blocking dopamine receptors, which normally inhibit prolactin secretion. Therefore, based on standard medical knowledge, Metoclopramide is the correct answer as it is associated with causing hyperprolactinemia.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opd\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}",
