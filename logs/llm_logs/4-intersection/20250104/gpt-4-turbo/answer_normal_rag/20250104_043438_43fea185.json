  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Nizatidine is indeed a H2 receptor blocker used in the treatment of peptic ulcer disease, aligning with the information that H2 receptor blockers treat diseases like duodenal ulcer, which is a type of peptic ulcer. This confirms the accuracy of option 'opa'. Regarding option 'opb', Nizatidine does not have 100% bioavailability; its bioavailability is approximately 70%, which makes this statement false. Option 'opc' mentions that Nizatidine enhances gastric emptying, which is true as it is a known effect of H2 blockers. Lastly, option 'opd' states that Nizatidine can lead to tachycardia. While H2 blockers can have cardiac side effects, tachycardia is not a commonly associated side effect of Nizatidine specifically, making this a less likely but possible effect. Therefore, the most clearly incorrect statement based on standard pharmacological knowledge is option 'opb'.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opb\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}",
