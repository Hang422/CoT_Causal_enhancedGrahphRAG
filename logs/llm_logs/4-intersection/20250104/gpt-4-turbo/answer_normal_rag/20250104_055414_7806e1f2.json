  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Progesterone is a hormone primarily produced in the ovaries, specifically by the corpus luteum after ovulation. The corpus luteum forms from the remnants of the follicle that has released an egg during the ovulation process. It secretes progesterone, which is crucial for maintaining the uterine lining and supporting early pregnancy. The other options, such as stroma, corpora albicans, and mature follicles, do not primarily produce progesterone. Stroma refers to the supportive tissue of the ovary, corpora albicans are the degenerated remains of the corpus luteum, and mature follicles mainly produce estrogen before ovulation.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opc\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}",
