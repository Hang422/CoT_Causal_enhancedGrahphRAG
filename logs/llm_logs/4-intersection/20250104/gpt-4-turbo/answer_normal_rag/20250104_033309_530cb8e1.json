  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Among the listed anti-tubercular drugs, Ethionamide is known to have a side effect profile that includes the potential to cause hypothyroidism. This aligns with the general knowledge that certain medications can interfere with thyroid function, leading to hypothyroidism. The other drugs listed (PAS, Cycloserine, and Pyrazinamide) do not commonly have this association. Therefore, based on standard medical knowledge and the specific side effects associated with Ethionamide, it is the most likely correct answer.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opb\",\n    \"confidence\": 85\n}",
