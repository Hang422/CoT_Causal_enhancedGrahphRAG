  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"The symptoms described in the question - vomiting, lethargy, and severe jaundice upon introduction of fruit juice - suggest a metabolic issue related to the breakdown of fructose. Aldolase B is an enzyme crucial in the fructose metabolism pathway, specifically in the liver. Deficiency in Aldolase B leads to hereditary fructose intolerance (HFI), which manifests when fructose or sucrose (which contains fructose) is introduced into the diet. This condition can lead to severe symptoms including hypoglycemia, vomiting, jaundice, and even liver failure if not managed by dietary restrictions. The other enzymes listed (Fructokinase, Aldolase A, and Sucrase) do not lead to the severe symptoms observed in this scenario when deficient. Fructokinase deficiency leads to essential fructosuria, a benign condition. Aldolase A deficiency affects glycolysis but is not typically associated with fructose ingestion. Sucrase deficiency would affect sucrose breakdown but does not typically result in severe jaundice or hypoglycemia.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opc\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}",
