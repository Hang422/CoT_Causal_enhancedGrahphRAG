  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Aspirin is known to predispose individuals to ulcers, particularly peptic ulcers, due to its effect on the stomach lining where it can increase gastric acid secretion and reduce the production of protective mucus. This can lead to or exacerbate existing peptic ulcers. The retrieved medical knowledge confirms this relationship by stating 'Aspirin PREDISPOSES Ulcer'. In contrast, aspirin is used therapeutically in conditions like unstable angina (as indicated by 'Aspirin TREATS Unstable angina'), and it is not contraindicated in fever or myalgia, where it may actually be beneficial due to its anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opb\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}",
