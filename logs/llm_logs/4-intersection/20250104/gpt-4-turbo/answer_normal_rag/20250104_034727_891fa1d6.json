  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Among the options provided, Dextromethorphan is known to cause hallucinations, especially at high doses. This is supported by the general knowledge that some antitussives, particularly those with psychoactive properties, can lead to such side effects. Morphine, an opioid, can also cause hallucinations, but it is primarily not used as an antitussive. Diphenhydramine, an antihistamine, primarily causes sedation and sometimes delirium, but not typically hallucinations in the context of its antitussive use. Aprepitant is used to prevent nausea and vomiting; it does not have a known association with causing hallucinations. Therefore, based on the standard medical knowledge and the options provided, Dextromethorphan is the most likely correct answer.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opb\",\n    \"confidence\": 85\n}",
