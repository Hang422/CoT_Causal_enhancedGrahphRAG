  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Valproic acid is known for its teratogenic effects, including causing neural tube defects, and it is associated with obesity and hyperandrogenism, which can lead to hirsutism. However, valproic acid is not an enzyme inducer; rather, it is an enzyme inhibitor, particularly of enzymes involved in drug metabolism such as cytochrome P450. This distinction is crucial as enzyme inducers increase the metabolism of drugs, potentially decreasing their efficacy, whereas inhibitors like valproic acid can increase drug levels and potentially lead to toxicity.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opa\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}",
