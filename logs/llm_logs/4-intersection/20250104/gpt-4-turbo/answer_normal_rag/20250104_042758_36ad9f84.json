  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Herpes simplex encephalitis is treated with specific antiviral agents. Acyclovir and Vidarabine are both known to be effective against herpes simplex virus infections, including encephalitis. Ganciclovir, while an antiviral, is more commonly used for cytomegalovirus infections rather than herpes simplex virus. Amantadine, on the other hand, is primarily used for influenza A and Parkinson's disease, and does not have efficacy against herpes viruses. Therefore, Amantadine is the correct answer as it is not used in the treatment of herpes simplex encephalitis.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opd\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}",
