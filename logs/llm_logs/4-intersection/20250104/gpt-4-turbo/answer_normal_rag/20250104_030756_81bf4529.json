  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"The patient's symptoms of diminished night vision and dry eyes, along with the presence of white triangular plaques on the conjunctiva, are indicative of Vitamin A deficiency. Vitamin A is crucial for maintaining healthy vision, particularly in low-light conditions, and for the integrity of epithelial tissues, which include the conjunctiva of the eyes. The history of recurrent bacterial infections can also be linked to Vitamin A deficiency, as it plays a role in maintaining immune system function. The retrieved medical knowledge supports this diagnosis by stating that Vitamin A deficiency causes eye diseases, which aligns with the patient's symptoms.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opc\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}",
