  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"The hormone used in the early detection of pregnancy is human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). This hormone is produced by the placenta shortly after the embryo attaches to the uterine lining. The presence of hCG in a woman's blood or urine is a key marker used in pregnancy tests. The other options listed, such as Endothelial Growth Factor (EGF), Human Chorionic Somatotropin (HCS), and Relaxin, do not serve this specific function in pregnancy detection. Therefore, based on standard medical knowledge, hCG is the correct answer.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opb\",\n    \"confidence\": 100\n}",
