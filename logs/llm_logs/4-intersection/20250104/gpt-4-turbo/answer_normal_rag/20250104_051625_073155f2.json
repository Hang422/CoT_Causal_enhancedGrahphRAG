Platelet dysfunction\nopb. Aspirin inhibits the action of heparin\nopc. Enhanced hypersensitivity of heparin\nopd. Therapy of heparin cannot be monitored\n\n### Retrieved Similar Medical Knowledge:\n- Histoplasma capsulatum CAUSES Granulomatous infection\n- Heparin ASSOCIATED_WITH Adverse effects\n- Shearing TREATS Stiffness\n- Coumarin necrosis COMPLICATES Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia\n- Antiphospholipid Syndrome COMPLICATES Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia\n- INSULIN TREATMENT PREVENTS Contraction\n- Aspirin PREDISPOSES Thrombosis\n- Heparin therapy CAUSES Adverse effects\n- U937 Cells INTERACTS_WITH Inflammatory cell\n- Heparin therapy CAUSES Complication\n- KB Cells LOCATION_OF Bacillus thuringiensis\n- Aspirin CAUSES Drug Allergy\n\n    ### Instructions:\n            - Use standard medical knowledge as the primary guide.\n            - Consider enhanced information only if it aligns with consensus.\n            - If conflicting or unclear, present the most likely correct answer based on known facts.\n            - It's acceptable to show moderate confidence if the question is complex, but still choose one best answer.\n    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2.

  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Aspirin is known to affect platelet function, leading to increased bleeding risk. Heparin, an anticoagulant, also increases the risk of bleeding. Combining aspirin with heparin can therefore exacerbate this risk due to the additive effects on bleeding tendencies. The retrieved medical knowledge does not directly address the interaction between aspirin and heparin, but standard medical knowledge supports the understanding that aspirin causes platelet dysfunction, which can be problematic when combined with other anticoagulants like heparin.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opa\",\n    \"confidence\": 85\n}",
