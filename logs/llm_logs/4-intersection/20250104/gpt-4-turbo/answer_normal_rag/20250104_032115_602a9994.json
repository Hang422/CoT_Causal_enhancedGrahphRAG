  "response": "```json\n{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Propranolol is known to be effective in treating conditions such as essential tremor, thyrotoxicosis, and various cardiovascular issues due to its beta-blocking properties. The retrieved medical knowledge confirms its use in treating thyrotoxicosis and essential tremor, which can be related to Parkinsonian tremor due to its anti-tremor effects. However, while propranolol can be used in some cardiovascular conditions, its role in atrial flutter is less direct and typically not the first line of treatment, especially when compared to drugs like amiodarone which are specifically indicated for atrial fibrillation and flutter. Therefore, the least likely use of propranolol among the given options is for atrial flutter.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opa\",\n    \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
