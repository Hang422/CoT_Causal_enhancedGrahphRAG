  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Aldosterone is a hormone that plays a crucial role in the regulation of sodium and potassium levels in the body, primarily by acting on the renal tubules. The primary site of aldosterone action is the distal tubules and the collecting duct of the nephron. It promotes sodium reabsorption and potassium excretion. The retrieved medical knowledge mentions aldosterone's association with renal tubular disorders and anti-diuresis, which supports its role in influencing renal function, particularly in the distal parts of the renal tubules. Although the collecting duct is also influenced by aldosterone, the primary and most significant effects are observed in the distal tubules, making this the best-supported option.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opb\",\n    \"confidence\": 90\n}",
