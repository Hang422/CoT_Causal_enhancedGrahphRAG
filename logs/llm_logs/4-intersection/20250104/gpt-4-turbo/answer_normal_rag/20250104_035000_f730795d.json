This aligns with standard medical understanding that Wernicke's encephalopathy is primarily caused by a deficiency in Vitamin B1 (Thiamine). The other options (B2, B6, B12) are not directly associated with Wernicke's encephalopathy in the retrieved data or standard medical consensus.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opa\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}",
