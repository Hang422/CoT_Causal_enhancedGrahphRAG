  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"The adrenal cortex is divided into three zones: the zona glomerulosa, zona fasciculata, and zona reticularis. Each zone is responsible for producing different types of hormones. The zona glomerulosa primarily produces mineralocorticoids, such as aldosterone, which is confirmed by the retrieved medical knowledge stating 'Aldosterone PART_OF Zona Glomerulosa'. The zona reticularis, on the other hand, is known for producing androgens, which are sex hormones. This is a well-established fact in medical physiology, although it is not directly stated in the retrieved similar medical knowledge. The options provided include glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids, which are mainly secreted by the zona fasciculata and zona glomerulosa respectively, and aldosterone, which is specifically a product of the zona glomerulosa. Therefore, by elimination and based on standard medical knowledge, the major hormone secreted by the zona reticularis is androgens.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opd\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}",
