  "response": "```json\n{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Analyzing the options based on standard medical knowledge: Option A states that amyloidosis associated with multiple myeloma has the poorest prognosis, which is generally true as it indicates a severe form of systemic amyloidosis with poor outcomes. Option B mentions that fine-needle biopsy of subcutaneous abdominal fat is a reliable method for diagnosing secondary systemic amyloidosis, which aligns with medical practices for diagnosing amyloidosis. Option C states that hepatic amyloid disease produces hepatomegaly but rarely jaundice, which is accurate because amyloid deposits in the liver typically lead to enlargement (hepatomegaly) without significant jaundice unless there is substantial liver dysfunction. Option D, which claims that amyloidosis of the spleen is associated with severe anemia, is not typically true. Amyloidosis can involve the spleen (splenomegaly), but it does not directly cause severe anemia; anemia in amyloidosis patients is usually mild unless there are other complicating factors.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opd\",\n    \"confidence\": 90\n}\n```",
