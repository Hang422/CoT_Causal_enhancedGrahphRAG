  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Diabetes insipidus is characterized by the inability of the kidneys to concentrate urine, leading to the production of large volumes of dilute urine. The typical urine osmolality in diabetes insipidus is less than 300 mmol/L, which is significantly lower than the normal range (500-800 mmol/L). This is due to a deficiency in antidiuretic hormone (ADH) or the kidney's response to ADH, resulting in decreased water reabsorption and increased urine output. The option <150 mmol/L represents a more specific and severe reduction in urine osmolality, which aligns with the typical presentation of diabetes insipidus where the kidneys are unable to concentrate urine effectively.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opa\",\n    \"confidence\": 90\n}",
