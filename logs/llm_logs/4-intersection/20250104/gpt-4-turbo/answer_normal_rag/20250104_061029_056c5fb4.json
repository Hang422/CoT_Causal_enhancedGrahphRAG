  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"The drug of choice for both gonococcal and non-gonococcal urethritis should effectively treat Neisseria gonorrhoeae, the causative agent of gonococcal urethritis, and also cover organisms responsible for non-gonococcal urethritis, such as Chlamydia trachomatis. Azithromycin is commonly used for this purpose as it covers a broad spectrum of pathogens involved in these infections. Clindamycin is not typically used for urethritis. Cefepime, while effective against a wide range of bacteria, is not the first-line treatment for urethritis. Metronidazole treats anaerobic bacteria and is used for bacterial vaginosis and trichomoniasis, but it is not effective against Neisseria gonorrhoeae or Chlamydia trachomatis, the primary pathogens in urethritis. Therefore, Azithromycin is the most appropriate choice among the options provided.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opd\",\n    \"confidence\": 90\n}",
