Mouth\nopb. Stomach\nopc. Small intestine\nopd. Large intestine\n\n### Retrieved Similar Medical Knowledge:\n- Arthralgia ASSOCIATED_WITH Polyarthritis\n- Colon LOCATION_OF Disaccharides\n- Exhaustion ASSOCIATED_WITH Lymphohistiocytosis, Hemophagocytic\n- Duodenum LOCATION_OF Disaccharides\n- Digests PROCESS_OF Gut\n- Myocytes, Smooth Muscle INTERACTS_WITH Vascular Endothelial Cells\n- Kinins CAUSES Impairment, cardiovascular\n- Entire nerve LOCATION_OF Stenosis, unspecified\n\n    ### Instructions:\n            - Use standard medical knowledge as the primary guide.\n            - Consider enhanced information only if it aligns with consensus.\n            - If conflicting or unclear, present the most likely correct answer based on known facts.\n            - It's acceptable to show moderate confidence if the question is complex, but still choose one best answer.\n    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3.

  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Digestion of disaccharides primarily occurs in the small intestine. This is where enzymes such as lactase, sucrase, and maltase are secreted by the intestinal lining to break down disaccharides into monosaccharides, which can then be absorbed. The retrieved medical knowledge mentions the duodenum, which is part of the small intestine, as a location of disaccharides, supporting the idea that disaccharide digestion occurs there. The other options (mouth, stomach, and large intestine) do not primarily involve the digestion of disaccharides, as the necessary enzymes are not active or present in significant amounts in these locations.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opc\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}",
