  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"The question asks for the most potent mineralocorticoid among the given options. Aldosterone is a well-known mineralocorticoid that plays a crucial role in regulating sodium and potassium levels in the body. DOCA (Deoxycorticosterone acetate) and Fludrocortisone are also mineralocorticoids, with Fludrocortisone being a synthetic corticosteroid with high mineralocorticoid activity. Triamcinolone, however, is primarily a glucocorticoid with negligible mineralocorticoid effects. Among the options, Fludrocortisone is known for its potent mineralocorticoid activity, often used clinically for its strong effects on sodium retention and potassium excretion, which are more pronounced than those of natural aldosterone. Therefore, based on standard pharmacological knowledge, Fludrocortisone is considered the most potent mineralocorticoid among the options listed.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opc\",\n    \"confidence\": 90\n}",
