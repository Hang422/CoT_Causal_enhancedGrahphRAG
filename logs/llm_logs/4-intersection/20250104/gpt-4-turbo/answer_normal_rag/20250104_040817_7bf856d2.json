  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"The question asks for a drug that blocks both basal and stimulated gastric acid secretion without affecting cholinergic, histaminergic, or gastrin receptors. Among the options, Omeprazole is a Proton Pump Inhibitor (PPI), which directly inhibits the hydrogen-potassium ATPase enzyme system at the secretory surface of the gastric parietal cell. This mechanism of action allows it to block the final step in acid production, thus reducing both basal and stimulated gastric acid secretion. This action is independent of the pathways mediated by cholinergic, histaminergic, or gastrin receptors. The other options, such as Loxatidine, Pirenzepine, and Famotidine, primarily act through histamine H2-receptor antagonism (Famotidine) or are not directly related to the inhibition of acid secretion through the proton pump (Pirenzepine and Loxatidine). Therefore, Omeprazole is the correct answer based on its mechanism of action and the requirements specified in the question.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opc\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}",
