  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"The question pertains to the enzyme responsible for the conversion of androgens to estrogens in the ovarian follicle. Aromatase is the enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of androgens (such as testosterone and androstenedione) to estrogens (such as estradiol). This is a well-established fact in endocrinology and reproductive physiology. The other options listed (5 alpha reductase, desmolase, isomerase) do not perform this specific function. 5 alpha reductase is involved in the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT), not to estrogen. Desmolase is involved in steroidogenesis but not specifically in the conversion of androgens to estrogens. Isomerase generally refers to enzymes that catalyze the rearrangement of bonds within molecules, but it does not specifically convert androgens to estrogens. Therefore, based on standard medical knowledge, aromatase is the correct answer.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opa\",\n    \"confidence\": 100\n}",
