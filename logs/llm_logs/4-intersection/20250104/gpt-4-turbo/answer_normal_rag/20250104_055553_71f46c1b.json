Vitamin B9\nopb. Vitamin B12\nopc. Vitamin B6\nopd. Vitamin B3\n\n### Retrieved Similar Medical Knowledge:\n- HMMR gene|HMMR PART_OF microtubule cytoskeleton\n- Entire collecting tubule PART_OF Bronchioles\n- vitamin B12 ASSOCIATED_WITH Zinc deficiency\n- 3,4-Methylenedioxyamphetamine TREATS Gastritis\n- Cell surface LOCATION_OF Sialic Acids\n- Insulin TREATS Granuloma Annulare\n\n    ### Instructions:\n            - Use standard medical knowledge as the primary guide.\n            - Consider enhanced information only if it aligns with consensus.\n            - If conflicting or unclear, present the most likely correct answer based on known facts.\n            - It's acceptable to show moderate confidence if the question is complex, but still choose one best answer.\n    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3.

  "response": "```json\n{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Isoniazid, a medication used primarily for the treatment of tuberculosis, is known to cause a deficiency in Vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) due to its interference with the metabolic pathway of this vitamin. This is a well-documented side effect and is commonly addressed in clinical practice by supplementing Vitamin B6 alongside isoniazid treatment to prevent associated neurological effects such as peripheral neuropathy. The retrieved medical knowledge does not directly address this question, but standard pharmacological knowledge supports the association between isoniazid and Vitamin B6 deficiency.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opc\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
