  "response": "{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"The retrieved medical knowledge indicates that Penicillin treatment is effective for Syphilis, which is caused by Treponema pallidum. This aligns with standard medical consensus that Penicillin G is the first-line treatment for infections caused by Treponema pallidum. The other options, such as Tetracycline, Azithromycin, and Doxycycline, are alternative treatments typically considered when a patient has an allergy to penicillin or in specific clinical scenarios. Therefore, based on the consensus and the specific mention of Penicillin in the context of treating Syphilis, Penicillin G is the most appropriate choice.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opa\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}",
