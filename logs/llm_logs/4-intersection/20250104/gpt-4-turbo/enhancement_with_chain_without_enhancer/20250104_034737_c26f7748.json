Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3.

Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"For the treatment of myoclonus in children, both Clonazepam and Sodium Valproate are effective options as they enhance GABA activity, which is crucial in reducing neuronal excitability and thereby decreasing myoclonic jerks. Clonazepam, a benzodiazepine, works by enhancing the effect of GABA at its receptor, which is supported by evidence paths linking benzodiazepines with GABA activity. Sodium Valproate, a broad-spectrum anticonvulsant, not only increases GABA levels but also has additional mechanisms that stabilize neuronal firing, making it a robust choice for managing myoclonus. Phenobarbitone, although it enhances GABA activity, is generally less preferred due to its side effect profile and impact on cognitive function. Ethosuximide, primarily used for absence seizures and acting through blocking T-type calcium channels, is not effective for myoclonus and is not recommended for this condition. Therefore, the best options for treating myoclonus in children are Clonazepam and Sodium Valproate, with a slight preference for Sodium Valproate due to its broad-spectrum efficacy.\"\n}",
