  "response": "### Enhanced Information Summary\n\nThe stomach is known to secrete several substances that aid in digestion. Among these, **pepsinogens** and **hydrochloric acid (HCl)** are well-documented. Pepsinogens are inactive precursors of the enzyme pepsin, which is crucial for the breakdown of proteins in the stomach. These are secreted by the chief cells located in the stomach lining. Hydrochloric acid, secreted by the parietal cells of the stomach, creates an acidic environment that is necessary for the activation of pepsin from pepsinogens and for overall digestion.\n\n**Lipase** is also secreted by the stomach but in much smaller quantities compared to its secretion in the pancreas. Gastric lipase plays a role in the digestion of fats but is not as significant in fat digestion as pancreatic lipase. The evidence paths mentioning lipase in relation to fat absorption and its association with the stomach confirm its presence and activity, albeit not as prominently as other digestive enzymes secreted by the stomach.\n\nGiven the options provided:\n- **Lipase** is secreted by the stomach but is not the primary lipase for fat digestion, which might lead to confusion about its role.\n- **Pepsinogens** and **HCl** are definitively secreted by the stomach.\n\nThe option **\"None\"** suggests that none of the listed substances are not secreted by the stomach, which is incorrect since all are indeed secreted, albeit with varying roles and significance.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer to the question \"Which is not secreted by the stomach?\" based on the standard medical consensus and the evidence provided would be **\"None\"**, as all listed substances are secreted by the stomach.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"The stomach secretes pepsinogens, HCl, and lipase. Pepsinogens and HCl are crucial for protein digestion and creating an acidic environment, respectively. Lipase is also secreted by the stomach but plays a less significant role compared to its secretion in the pancreas. Therefore, all options listed are secreted by the stomach, making 'None' the correct answer.\"\n}\n```",
