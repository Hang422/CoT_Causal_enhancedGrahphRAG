      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Physiology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Seoli cell secrets\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Androgen binding protein\nopb. Testosterone\nopc. LH\nopd. FSH\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Sertoli cell\" -> \"supports spermatogenesis\" -> \"secretes androgen binding protein\" -> \"facilitates concentration of testosterone in seminiferous tubules\" -> 95% CHAIN: \"Sertoli cell\" -> \"located in testes\" -> \"influenced by FSH\" -> \"FSH stimulates secretion of androgen binding protein\" -> 90% CHAIN: \"Sertoli cell\" -> \"does not produce hormones directly\" -> \"does not secrete LH\" -> \"LH is secreted by pituitary gland\" -> 98% CHAIN: \"Sertoli cell\" -> \"supports and nourishes developing sperm cells\" -> \"does not secrete testosterone\" -> \"testosterone produced by Leydig cells\" -> 95%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Luteinizing Hormone)-CAUSES->(Reproductive function)-PROCESS_OF->(Pituitary Gland)\n(Luteinizing Hormone)-CAUSES->(paracrine)-PROCESS_OF->(Pituitary Gland)\n(Luteinizing Hormone)-CAUSES->(Physiologic pulse)-PROCESS_OF->(Pituitary Gland)\n(Androgen-Binding Proteins)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Germ Cells)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Testosterone)\n(Androgen-Binding Proteins)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Germ Cells)-LOCATION_OF->(Testosterone)\n(Structure of sertoli cell)-PART_OF->(Inferior Colliculus)\n(Structure of sertoli cell)-LOCATION_OF->(Lipopolysaccharides)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Hormones)\n(Structure of sertoli cell)-PART_OF->(Prostate)-LOCATION_OF->(Hormones)\n(Hormones)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Luteinizing Hormone)\n(Structure of sertoli cell)-INTERACTS_WITH->(sperm cell)\n(sperm cell)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cells)-LOCATION_OF->(Testosterone)\n(sperm cell)-PART_OF->(Column)-LOCATION_OF->(Testosterone)\n(Support, device)-PREVENTS->(Complication)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Genes)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Testosterone)\n(Support, device)-TREATS->(Shock, Cardiogenic)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Genes)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Testosterone)\n(Testosterone)-PART_OF->(Structure of interstitial cell of Leydig)\n(Testosterone)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Structure of interstitial cell of Leydig)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Sertoli cells, located within the seminiferous tubules of the testes, play a crucial role in supporting and nourishing developing sperm cells through the process of spermatogenesis. One of the key functions of Sertoli cells is the secretion of androgen-binding protein (ABP), which is stimulated by follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). ABP helps to maintain high concentrations of testosterone in the vicinity of the developing sperm by binding testosterone, which is primarily produced by the Leydig cells adjacent to the seminiferous tubules. This local increase in testosterone concentration is critical for the proper development of sperm. Luteinizing hormone (LH), although vital for stimulating testosterone production in Leydig cells, is not secreted by Sertoli cells but by the pituitary gland. The evidence paths confirm the interaction of androgen-binding proteins with germ cells and testosterone, supporting the role of Sertoli cells in concentrating testosterone through ABP. Additionally, the paths clarify that testosterone is indeed produced by Leydig cells, not Sertoli cells, aligning with the corrected reasoning chains.\"\n}",
