  "response": "### Enhanced Information Summary\n\nThe question requires selecting a drug that blocks both basal and stimulated gastric acid secretion without affecting cholinergic, histaminergic, or gastrin receptors. Based on the standard medical consensus:\n\n1. **Omeprazole** is a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) that inhibits the H+/K+ ATPase enzyme system at the secretory surface of the gastric parietal cell. This mechanism effectively blocks both basal and stimulated gastric acid secretion. The evidence paths confirm Omeprazole's classification as a PPI and its interaction with the enzyme system, supporting its broad inhibition of acid secretion without direct interaction with cholinergic, histaminergic, or gastrin receptors.\n\n2. **Loxatidine** and **Famotidine** are both H2 receptor antagonists. They primarily block the action of histamine on H2 receptors, which predominantly affects stimulated acid secretion. Both drugs are less effective in blocking basal gastric acid secretion and directly interact with histaminergic pathways, contradicting the requirement of the question.\n\n3. **Pirenzepine** is an M1 muscarinic receptor antagonist. It primarily reduces basal acid secretion by blocking the effect of acetylcholine on gastric cells and is less effective on stimulated gastric acid secretion. This action involves cholinergic pathways, which does not meet the criteria of the question.\n\nGiven the analysis and the evidence paths provided, **Omeprazole** is the only drug among the options that meets all the criteria specified in the question. It blocks both basal and stimulated gastric acid secretion effectively and does not interact with cholinergic, histaminergic, or gastrin receptors.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Omeprazole, a proton pump inhibitor, effectively blocks both basal and stimulated gastric acid secretion by inhibiting the H+/K+ ATPase enzyme system in the gastric parietal cell.
