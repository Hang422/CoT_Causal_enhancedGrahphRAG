Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"The patient's symptoms of diminished night vision, dry eyes, and white triangular plaques on the conjunctiva (Bitot's spots), along with a history of recurrent bacterial infections, strongly suggest a deficiency of Vitamin A. Night blindness and xerophthalmia (dryness of the eyes) are classic signs of Vitamin A deficiency. Bitot's spots are specifically associated with this deficiency and are not typically linked to deficiencies of Vitamins D, B, or C. Vitamin A is also crucial for maintaining a healthy immune system, which aligns with the patient's history of recurrent infections. The evidence paths confirm the association between these symptoms and Vitamin A deficiency, particularly highlighting the direct causes of night blindness and xerophthalmia due to this deficiency. Other vitamins mentioned do not show a direct link to the combination of symptoms presented by the patient.\"\n}",
