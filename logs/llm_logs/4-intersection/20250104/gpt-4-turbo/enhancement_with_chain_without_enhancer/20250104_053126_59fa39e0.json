      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Pimozide belongs to class of:\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Thiothixanthene\nopb. Phenothiazine\nopc. Butyrophenone\nopd. Diphenyl butyl piperidine\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Pimozide\" -> \"antipsychotic medication\" -> \"belongs to diphenyl butyl piperidine class\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Pimozide\" -> \"used for Tourette's syndrome and schizophrenia\" -> \"not a phenothiazine\" -> \"not a thiothixanthene\" -> \"not a butyrophenone\" -> \"classified as diphenyl butyl piperidine\" -> 95%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Pimozide)-TREATS->(Gilles de la Tourette syndrome)\n(Pimozide)-ISA->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Antipsychotic Agents)\n(Pimozide)-ISA->(Psychotropic Drugs)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Antipsychotic Agents)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "### Enhanced Information Summary\n\nPimozide is an antipsychotic medication primarily used in the treatment of Tourette's syndrome and schizophrenia. It belongs to the class of diphenyl butyl piperidine. This classification is supported by standard pharmacological consensus, which identifies pimozide distinctly within this class due to its chemical structure and mechanism of action.\n\nThe reasoning chains provided correctly identify pimozide as a diphenyl butyl piperidine. The evidence paths, while broad, confirm pimozide's role as an antipsychotic agent and its application in treating psychiatric conditions like Gilles de la Tourette syndrome, aligning with its use profile in clinical settings. These paths support the classification by highlighting its therapeutic use and interaction within the realm of psychotropic and antipsychotic medications, though they do not directly address the chemical class.\n\nThe options of thiothixene, phenothiazine, and butyrophenone are incorrect for pimozide. The reasoning chains effectively rule out these classes by confirming pimozide's classification as diphenyl butyl piperidine, which is distinct from the other classes mentioned.\n\nIn conclusion, the correct classification of pimozide is as a diphenyl butyl piperidine antipsychotic, used notably for Tourette's syndrome and schizophrenia, and this is supported by both the reasoning chains and the broad evidence paths provided.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Pimozide is an antipsychotic medication used primarily for Tourette's syndrome and schizophrenia, correctly classified as belonging to the diphenyl butyl piperidine class. This classification is supported by pharmacological consensus and its therapeutic use profile, as confirmed by evidence paths indicating its role and interaction as an antipsychotic agent.\"\n}\n```",
