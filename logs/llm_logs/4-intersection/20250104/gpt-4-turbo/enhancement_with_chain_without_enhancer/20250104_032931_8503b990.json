  "response": "### Enhanced Information Summary\n\nFosphenytoin is a prodrug of phenytoin, primarily designed for parenteral use to avoid the complications associated with direct phenytoin intravenous administration, such as precipitation and phlebitis. Unlike phenytoin, fosphenytoin can be mixed with saline, which is a significant difference in their administration profiles. This is supported by the reasoning chain that fosphenytoin, being a prodrug, is converted into phenytoin upon administration and can be mixed with saline for IV administration to reduce risks associated with phenytoin IV use.\n\nFosphenytoin is not intended for oral administration, aligning with the consensus that it is designed for parenteral use. This is a key difference from phenytoin, which can be administered orally.\n\nRegarding the effectiveness in treating specific types of seizures, both fosphenytoin and phenytoin are not used for absence seizures nor are they the drugs of choice for myoclonic seizures. The reasoning chains correctly reflect that fosphenytoin, being metabolized into phenytoin, shares these clinical indications and limitations.\n\nThe retrieved evidence paths, while broad, confirm that phenytoin (and by extension, fosphenytoin) is not typically indicated for absence or myoclonic seizures, focusing instead on other types of seizures. The paths related to the treatment of cardiac arrhythmia and interactions with the SCN5A gene, although correct, do not directly contribute to answering the question about differences between fosphenytoin and phenytoin in the context of seizure management.\n\nIn conclusion, the primary differences between fosphenytoin and phenytoin lie in their administration routes and formulations, specifically that fosphenytoin can be mixed with saline for IV use and is not intended for oral administration, unlike phenytoin.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Fosphenytoin, a prodrug of phenytoin, is designed for parenteral use and can be mixed with saline for IV administration, reducing risks like precipitation and phlebitis associated with phenytoin IV use.
