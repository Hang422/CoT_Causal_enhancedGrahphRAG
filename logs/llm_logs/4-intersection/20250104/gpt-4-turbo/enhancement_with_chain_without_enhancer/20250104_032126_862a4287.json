Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2.

Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "### Enhanced Information Summary\n\nSchizophrenia is primarily treated with antipsychotic medications. The consensus in medical and pharmacological fields supports that schizophrenia involves an imbalance of neurotransmitters, particularly dopamine. Antipsychotics are effective because they primarily block dopamine receptors, which is crucial in managing the psychotic symptoms such as delusions and hallucinations. This is supported by evidence paths linking dopamine interactions with antipsychotic agents, confirming the dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia.\n\nWhile mood stabilizers and antidepressants are sometimes used in treating schizophrenia, they are generally adjunctive treatments rather than primary therapies. Mood stabilizers may be used to manage mood symptoms that can co-occur with schizophrenia, but they do not directly address the core psychotic symptoms of the disorder. Similarly, antidepressants may be prescribed to manage co-occurring depressive symptoms in patients with schizophrenia but have no direct effect on the schizophrenia itself.\n\nAntiepileptics, though they stabilize neural activity, are not a standard treatment for schizophrenia and have an unclear effect on its symptoms. The evidence does not strongly support their use as a primary treatment in schizophrenia management.\n\nIn conclusion, the primary and most effective treatment for schizophrenia, as supported by both medical consensus and evidence paths, is the use of antipsychotic medications. Other treatments like mood stabilizers and antidepressants serve more to manage co-occurring symptoms rather than the schizophrenia itself.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Schizophrenia is primarily treated with antipsychotic medications, which effectively manage psychotic symptoms by blocking dopamine receptors.
