  "response": "### Enhanced Information Summary\n\nWernicke's encephalopathy is primarily associated with a deficiency of thiamine, also known as Vitamin B1. This condition is often linked to chronic alcoholism, which impairs the absorption of nutrients including thiamine. The deficiency of thiamine leads to neurological symptoms such as confusion, ataxia, and ophthalmoplegia, which are characteristic of Wernicke's encephalopathy. Treatment of the condition with thiamine supplementation typically results in an effective resolution of these symptoms, further confirming the central role of Vitamin B1 deficiency in the pathology of Wernicke's encephalopathy.\n\nThe retrieved evidence paths support these connections, highlighting the role of thiamine in treating various conditions linked to metabolic and neurological disturbances, and specifically noting its use in conditions like beriberi, which also results from thiamine deficiency. Additionally, the paths indicate the broader implications of thiamine in energy metabolism and its critical role in the nervous system, aligning with the symptoms observed in Wernicke's encephalopathy.\n\nIn conclusion, the major vitamin deficiency in Wernicke's encephalopathy is Vitamin B1 (thiamine), supported by both clinical presentation and treatment outcomes, as well as corroborated by evidence paths that emphasize thiamine's essential function in neurological health and nutrient metabolism.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Wernicke's encephalopathy is primarily associated with a deficiency of thiamine, also known as Vitamin B1.
