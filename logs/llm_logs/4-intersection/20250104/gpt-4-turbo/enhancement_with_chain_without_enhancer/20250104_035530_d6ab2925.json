      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Drug the choice for hyperthyroidism in first trimester of pregnancy is\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Methimazole\nopb. Propylthiouraril\nopc. Carbimazole\nopd. Perchlorate\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Propylthiouracil\" -> \"preferred for hyperthyroidism treatment in first trimester\" -> \"lower risk of teratogenic effects compared to Methimazole\" -> \"safe for developing fetus\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Methimazole\" -> \"used for hyperthyroidism\" -> \"higher teratogenic risks in first trimester compared to Propylthiouracil\" -> \"not recommended in first trimester\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Carbimazole\" -> \"metabolized to Methimazole\" -> \"similar teratogenic risks as Methimazole\" -> \"not preferred in first trimester\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Perchlorate\" -> \"used to block iodine uptake\" -> \"less effective and less studied for managing hyperthyroidism in pregnancy\" -> \"not a first-line treatment\" -> 80%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Propylthiouracil)-TREATS->(Hyperthyroidism)\n(Methimazole)-CAUSES->(Hyperthyroidism)\n(Obstruction)-CAUSES->(Hyperthyroidism)\n(Hyperthyroidism)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Pathogenesis)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Enzymes)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Methimazole)\n(Hyperthyroidism)-PREDISPOSES->(Complication)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(TPO gene|TPO)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Methimazole)\n(Hyperthyroidism)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Pathogenesis)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(ABL2|RERE)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Propylthiouracil)\n(Hyperthyroidism)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Pathogenesis)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(CDKN2A gene|CDKN2A)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Propylthiouracil)\n(Carbimazole)-TREATS->(Disease)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Virus)-LOCATION_OF->(Enzymes)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Methimazole)\n(Carbimazole)-TREATS->(Respiratory Failure)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Virus)-LOCATION_OF->(Enzymes)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Methimazole)\n(Iodine uptake)-DIAGNOSES->(Disease)-COMPLICATES->(Hyperthyroidism)\n(Iodine uptake)-DIAGNOSES->(Disease)-PREDISPOSES->(Hyperthyroidism)\n(Hyperthyroidism)-PREDISPOSES->(Inflammation)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Genes)-PART_OF->(Bone Marrow)-LOCATION_OF->(First line treatment)\n(Hyperthyroidism)-CAUSES->(Inflammation)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Genes)-PART_OF->(Bone Marrow)-LOCATION_OF->(First line treatment)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Propylthiouracil is the preferred treatment for hyperthyroidism in the first trimester of pregnancy due to its lower risk of teratogenic effects compared to Methimazole. Methimazole and its pro-drug Carbimazole, which is metabolized to Methimazole, carry higher teratogenic risks and are not recommended during the first trimester. Perchlorate, being less effective and less studied for managing hyperthyroidism in pregnancy, is not considered a first-line treatment. The evidence path confirming Propylthiouracil's use in treating hyperthyroidism supports its safety and efficacy in this specific context.\"\n}",
