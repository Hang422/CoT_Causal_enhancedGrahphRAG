      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Patients on isoniazid which vitamin deficiency is more likely to be seen.\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Vitamin B9\nopb. Vitamin B12\nopc. Vitamin B6\nopd. Vitamin B3\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Isoniazid use\" -> \"inhibits pyridoxine (vitamin B6) kinase\" -> \"decreased activation of vitamin B6\" -> \"vitamin B6 deficiency\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Isoniazid use\" -> \"increased demand for pyridoxine\" -> \"depletion of vitamin B6 stores\" -> \"vitamin B6 deficiency\" -> 92%\nCHAIN: \"Isoniazid use\" -> \"interferes with vitamin B6 metabolism\" -> \"reduced availability of pyridoxal phosphate\" -> \"impaired neurotransmitter synthesis\" -> \"possible neurological symptoms\" -> \"vitamin B6 deficiency\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Isoniazid use\" -> \"no direct effect on vitamin B12 metabolism\" -> \"vitamin B12 levels likely unaffected\" -> 80%\nCHAIN: \"Isoniazid use\" -> \"no direct effect on vitamin B9 metabolism\" -> \"vitamin B9 levels likely unaffected\" -> 80%\nCHAIN: \"Isoniazid use\" -> \"no direct effect on vitamin B3 metabolism\" -> \"vitamin B3 levels likely unaffected\" -> 80%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(pyridoxine)-TREATS->(Vitamin B 6 Deficiency)\n(pyridoxine)-TREATS->(Vitamin B 6 Deficiency)\n(Neurologic Symptoms)-CAUSES->(Disease)-CAUSES->(Inflammation)-CAUSES->(Vitamin B 6 Deficiency)\n(isoniazid)-TREATS->(Disease)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(uptake)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(pyridoxine)\n(isoniazid)-TREATS->(Symptoms)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(uptake)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(pyridoxine)\n(isoniazid)-TREATS->(Disease)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(uptake)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(pyridoxine)\n(isoniazid)-TREATS->(Symptoms)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(uptake)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(pyridoxine)\n(Demand (clinical))-TREATS->(Disease)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Saccharomyces cerevisiae)-LOCATION_OF->(pyridoxine)\n(Demand (clinical))-PREVENTS->(Disease)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Saccharomyces cerevisiae)-LOCATION_OF->(pyridoxine)\n(isoniazid)-PREVENTS->(Complication)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Genes)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Vitamin B 12)\n(isoniazid)-TREATS->(Complication)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(TFPI)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Vitamin B 12)\n(isoniazid)-TREATS->(Infection)-PROCESS_OF->(Bacillus subtilis)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Folic Acid)\n(isoniazid)-TREATS->(Complication)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(APP gene)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Folic Acid)\n(isoniazid)-TREATS->(HIV)-LOCATION_OF->(Fatty Acids, Nonesterified)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Nicotinic Acid)\n(isoniazid)-TREATS->(HIV)-LOCATION_OF->(Enzymes)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Nicotinic Acid)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Isoniazid, a medication used primarily for tuberculosis treatment, is known to interfere with vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) metabolism. This interference occurs because isoniazid inhibits the enzyme pyridoxine kinase, which is crucial for the activation of vitamin B6. As a result, patients on isoniazid are at an increased risk of developing vitamin B6 deficiency. This deficiency can lead to impaired neurotransmitter synthesis, potentially causing neurological symptoms. The evidence paths confirm that pyridoxine treats vitamin B6 deficiency and that isoniazid's interaction with pyridoxine metabolism leads to increased demand and depletion of vitamin B6 stores. There is no substantial evidence linking isoniazid use directly to the metabolism of vitamins B12, B9, or B3, and these vitamins are likely unaffected by isoniazid treatment.\"\n}",
