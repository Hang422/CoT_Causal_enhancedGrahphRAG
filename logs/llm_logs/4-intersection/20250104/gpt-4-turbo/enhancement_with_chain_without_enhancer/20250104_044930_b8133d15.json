  "response": "### Enhanced Information Summary\n\nCardiac muscle is characterized by several distinct features that differentiate it from other muscle types. Here's a breakdown of the options provided, aligned with medical consensus and supported by relevant evidence:\n\n1. **Striated**: Cardiac muscle is indeed striated, similar to skeletal muscle, due to the organized arrangement of actin and myosin filaments. This is a well-established fact in histology and muscle physiology, confirming the accuracy of option A.\n\n2. **Large T tubules**: The T tubules in cardiac muscle are actually smaller and less extensive compared to those in skeletal muscle. This is a crucial point of differentiation often highlighted in studies of muscle cell structure and function. Therefore, option B is incorrect as it suggests that cardiac muscle has large T tubules, which contradicts standard medical consensus.\n\n3. **Troponin system present**: Cardiac muscle uses the troponin complex for calcium-mediated regulation of contraction, similar to skeletal muscle. This is a fundamental aspect of cardiac muscle physiology, supporting the accuracy of option C.\n\n4. **Caldesmon as an important regulatory protein**: Caldesmon is predominantly associated with smooth muscle, where it plays a role in regulating contraction by interacting with actin and myosin. In cardiac muscle, the primary regulatory proteins involved in contraction are troponin and tropomyosin, not caldesmon. This makes option D incorrect as it misattributes the role of caldesmon to cardiac muscle.\n\n**Relevant Evidence Paths**:\n- The evidence paths linking troponin with myocardial locations and its association with conditions like atrial fibrillation and left ventricular systolic dysfunction reinforce its role in cardiac muscle function.\n- The interaction of caldesmon primarily with cells in smooth muscle tissue further supports the assertion that it is not a key regulatory protein in cardiac muscle.\n\nIn conclusion, the features of cardiac muscle include being striated and having a troponin system for contraction regulation, but not having large T tubules or caldesmon as an important regulatory protein. The incorrect statement among the options, based on standard medical consensus and supported by relevant evidence, is option D, which incorrectly attributes caldesmon as a regulatory protein in cardiac muscle.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Cardiac muscle is striated and utilizes the troponin system for contraction, but contrary to option B, it has smaller T tubules compared to skeletal muscle. Caldesmon, mentioned in option D, is significant in smooth muscle, not cardiac muscle, where troponin and tropomyosin are the primary regulatory proteins. Thus, option D is the correct answer as it incorrectly attributes caldesmon as a regulatory protein in cardiac muscle.\"\n}\n```",
