      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Biochemistry.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        SACD (Subacute combined degeneration of cord) is feature of which vitamin deficiency?\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Vitamin A\nopb. Vitamin B6\nopc. Vitamin B9\nopd. Vitamin B12\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Vitamin B12 deficiency\" -> \"disruption in myelin synthesis\" -> \"demyelination in the spinal cord\" -> \"Subacute combined degeneration of cord (SACD)\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Vitamin B6 deficiency\" -> \"neurological symptoms\" -> \"possible confusion with SACD\" -> \"unlikely cause of SACD\" -> 10%\nCHAIN: \"Vitamin A deficiency\" -> \"affects vision and immune function\" -> \"not directly linked to myelin or spinal cord health\" -> \"not a cause of SACD\" -> 5%\nCHAIN: \"Vitamin B9 deficiency\" -> \"leads to anemia and other hematological issues\" -> \"possible neurological complications\" -> \"not typically causing SACD\" -> 15%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Demyelination)-CAUSES->(Guillain-Barre Syndrome)-CAUSES->(Subacute combined degeneration of spinal cord)\n(Vitamin B 6 Deficiency)-CAUSES->(Neurologic Symptoms)\n(Neurologic Symptoms)-CAUSES->(Disease)-COMPLICATES->(Confusion)\n(Neurologic Symptoms)-CAUSES->(Ischemic stroke)-COMPLICATES->(Confusion)\n(Neurologic Symptoms)-PREDISPOSES->(Encephalopathies)-PREDISPOSES->(Confusion)\n(Folic Acid Deficiency)-CAUSES->(Anemia)\n(Anemia)-CAUSES->(NEUROLOGIC COMPLICATION)\n(Spinal Cord)-LOCATION_OF->(Subacute combined degeneration of spinal cord)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord (SACD) is primarily associated with Vitamin B12 deficiency. This deficiency leads to a disruption in myelin synthesis, which is crucial for nerve fiber protection and signal transmission in the nervous system, including the spinal cord. The resulting demyelination specifically in the spinal cord manifests as SACD. The evidence path linking demyelination to neurological disorders such as Guillain-Barre Syndrome, and further to SACD, supports this association, although the path is somewhat broad. Other vitamins such as Vitamin B6, Vitamin A, and Vitamin B9, though they can cause neurological symptoms or anemia, do not typically lead to SACD. Vitamin B6 deficiency primarily results in different neurological symptoms, and while Vitamin B9 deficiency can lead to neurological complications due to anemia, it does not specifically cause SACD. Vitamin A deficiency impacts vision and immune function but is not linked to myelin health or spinal cord degeneration.\"\n}",
