      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Which of the following causes retinal pigmentation?\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Quinine\nopb. Chloroquine\nopc. Mefloquine\nopd. Atovaquone\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Chloroquine\" -> \"accumulates in the retina\" -> \"causes retinal toxicity\" -> \"leads to retinal pigmentation\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Quinine\" -> \"used primarily for malaria\" -> \"no strong evidence linking to retinal pigmentation\" -> \"unlikely to cause retinal pigmentation\" -> 20%\nCHAIN: \"Mefloquine\" -> \"used for malaria prevention and treatment\" -> \"no documented cases of retinal pigmentation\" -> \"unlikely to cause retinal pigmentation\" -> 20%\nCHAIN: \"Atovaquone\" -> \"used in combination for malaria and pneumocystis pneumonia\" -> \"no reports of causing retinal pigmentation\" -> \"unlikely to cause retinal pigmentation\" -> 20%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Chloroquine)-TREATS->(Disease)-CAUSES->(arterial stiffness)-PROCESS_OF->(Retina)\n(Chloroquine)-TREATS->(Disease)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(uptake)-PROCESS_OF->(Retina)\n(Chloroquine)-TREATS->(Disease)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(biological adaptation to stress)-PROCESS_OF->(Retina)\n(Quinine)-TREATS->(Malaria)\n(Malaria)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Immunity)-PROCESS_OF->(Retina)\n(Malaria)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Energy Metabolism)-PROCESS_OF->(Retina)\n(Mefloquine)-TREATS->(Malaria)\n(Malaria)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Immunity)-PROCESS_OF->(Retina)\n(Malaria)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Energy Metabolism)-PROCESS_OF->(Retina)\n(Prophylactic treatment)-CAUSES->(Disease)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(paracrine)-PROCESS_OF->(Retina)\n(Prophylactic treatment)-CAUSES->(Disease)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(uptake)-PROCESS_OF->(Retina)\n(atovaquone)-TREATS->(Malaria)\n(Malaria)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Immunity)-PROCESS_OF->(Retina)\n(Malaria)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Energy Metabolism)-PROCESS_OF->(Retina)\n(Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia)-CAUSES->(Disease)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(paracrine)-PROCESS_OF->(Retina)\n(Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia)-CAUSES->(Symptoms)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(paracrine)-PROCESS_OF->(Retina)\n(Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia)-CAUSES->(Respiratory Distress Syndrome, Adult)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(paracrine)-PROCESS_OF->(Retina)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Chloroquine is known to accumulate in the retina and can cause retinal toxicity, which may lead to retinal pigmentation. This is supported by medical consensus and aligns with the evidence path indicating Chloroquine's interaction with the retina. Other options such as Quinine, Mefloquine, and Atovaquone, primarily used for treating malaria, do not have documented evidence or strong links to causing retinal pigmentation, and thus are unlikely to cause this condition. The evidence paths related to these drugs primarily focus on their role in treating malaria and do not provide any direct or substantial link to retinal pigmentation.\"\n}",
