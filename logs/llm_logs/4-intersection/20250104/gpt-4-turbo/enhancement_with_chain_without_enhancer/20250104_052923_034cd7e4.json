  "response": "### Enhanced Information Summary\n\nThe dorsal column of the spinal cord is known to carry specific types of sensory information, primarily related to proprioception, vibratory sense, and fine touch. These modalities are well-documented in medical literature and are crucial for the body's ability to sense its position and movement in space, as well as to detect fine gradations of pressure or texture through touch.\n\n1. **Proprioception**: The dorsal column is indeed responsible for carrying proprioceptive information from the body to the brain. This is a well-established fact in neuroanatomy and is crucial for maintaining body posture and coordination.\n\n2. **Vibratory Sense**: Similarly, the dorsal column also carries information related to the vibratory sense. This sensory modality helps in detecting vibrations through mechanoreceptors in the skin and deeper tissues.\n\n3. **Touch**: The dorsal column's role in transmitting information related to fine touch is also well-supported. This includes sensations that allow for the discrimination of texture and shapes, which are essential for detailed hand functions and other sensitive tasks.\n\n4. **Heat Sensation**: In contrast to the above modalities, the transmission of heat sensation does not primarily occur through the dorsal columns. Instead, thermal sensations (both heat and cold) are typically conveyed via the spinothalamic tract, which is a different pathway within the spinal cord. This distinction is crucial for understanding sensory pathways and their implications in clinical neurology.\n\nThe retrieved evidence paths, while broadly correct about the spinal cord's involvement in sensory processing, do not directly address the specific question of which modalities are carried by the dorsal column. Therefore, these paths do not provide additional useful information for this query and are not included in the final reasoning.\n\n**Conclusion**: Based on standard medical consensus, heat sensation is not carried in the dorsal column of the spinal cord, making it the correct answer to the question. The other options (proprioception, vibratory sense, and touch) are indeed associated with the dorsal column.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Heat sensation is not carried in the dorsal column of the spinal cord, which instead transmits proprioception, vibratory sense, and fine touch.
