  "response": "### Enhanced Information Summary\n\nFinasteride is a 5α reductase inhibitor that effectively reduces the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT). This reduction in DHT levels is crucial in treating both benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH) and male pattern baldness (androgenetic alopecia). In the case of BPH, decreased DHT levels lead to a reduction in prostate gland size, alleviating symptoms associated with BPH. For male pattern baldness, lowering DHT levels in scalp hair follicles slows down hair loss.\n\nThe evidence paths confirm the role of DHT in both the prostate and scalp structures, supporting the mechanism by which finasteride operates. The paths related to the interaction of genes with finasteride in the context of BPH and androgenetic alopecia further validate finasteride's effectiveness in these conditions.\n\nOther options such as Flutamide, Prazosin, and Minoxidil do not function as 5α reductase inhibitors. Flutamide is an antiandrogen that blocks androgen receptors but does not inhibit the enzyme 5α reductase. Prazosin is an alpha-1 adrenergic receptor blocker used primarily for hypertension and facilitating urinary flow in BPH but does not impact DHT production. Minoxidil is a vasodilator used to promote hair growth and treat hypertension, also not affecting DHT levels.\n\nIn conclusion, finasteride is the only option among those listed that acts as a 5α reductase inhibitor and is clinically proven to be effective in treating both benign prostatic hypertrophy and male pattern baldness by reducing DHT levels.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Finasteride is a 5α reductase inhibitor that effectively reduces the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT), crucial for treating both benign prostatic hypertrophy and male pattern baldness.
