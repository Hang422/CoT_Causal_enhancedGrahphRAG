Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3.

Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "### Enhanced Information Summary\n\n**Azithromycin** is the drug of choice for both gonococcal and non-gonococcal urethritis. This decision is supported by its effectiveness against both **Neisseria gonorrhoeae** and **Chlamydia trachomatis**, the primary pathogens responsible for these conditions. Azithromycin's broad activity against these bacteria makes it suitable for treating infections where the exact causative agent might not be immediately known, providing a dual treatment advantage.\n\n- **Evidence and Consensus**: Azithromycin is recommended by clinical guidelines for the treatment of chlamydial infections and is also effective against gonococcal infections. This aligns with the retrieved evidence paths indicating the causative role of **Chlamydia trachomatis** in urethritis and the effectiveness of azithromycin in treating such infections.\n\n**Cefepime**, while a broad-spectrum antibiotic, is not the first-line treatment for Chlamydia trachomatis infections and is less effective for non-gonococcal urethritis. It is effective against Neisseria gonorrhoeae but not optimal for dual treatment due to its lesser activity against Chlamydia trachomatis.\n\n**Metronidazole** is effective against anaerobic bacteria but does not cover Neisseria gonorrhoeae or Chlamydia trachomatis, making it unsuitable for treating either gonococcal or non-gonococcal urethritis.\n\n**Clindamycin** is effective against anaerobic bacteria and some protozoa but lacks efficacy against Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis, rendering it ineffective for treating urethritis caused by these pathogens.\n\nIn conclusion, **azithromycin** stands out as the most appropriate and effective choice for treating both gonococcal and non-gonococcal urethritis, supported by its broad-spectrum activity against the key pathogens involved and alignment with medical consensus and guidelines.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Azithromycin is the preferred drug for treating both gonococcal and non-gonococcal urethritis due to its effectiveness against Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis. Clinical guidelines support its use for these indications, making it an optimal choice for dual treatment of these infections. Other options like cefepime, metronidazole, and clindamycin do not adequately cover both pathogens and are not recommended as first-line treatments for urethritis.\"\n}\n```",
