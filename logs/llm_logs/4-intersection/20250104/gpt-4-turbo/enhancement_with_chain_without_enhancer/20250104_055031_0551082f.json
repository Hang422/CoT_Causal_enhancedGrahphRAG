Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        In all of the following enzyme deficiencies, hyperammonemia is a common feature, EXCEPT:\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Argininosuccinate synthetase\nopb. Carbamoyl Phosphate synthetase (CPS-I)\nopc. Ornithine transcarbamoylase (OTC)\nopd. Ornithine amino transferase\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Argininosuccinate synthetase deficiency\" -> \"urea cycle disorder\" -> \"inability to convert citrulline to argininosuccinate\" -> \"accumulation of ammonia\" -> \"hyperammonemia\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Carbamoyl Phosphate Synthetase (CPS-I) deficiency\" -> \"urea cycle disorder\" -> \"inability to synthesize carbamoyl phosphate from ammonia\" -> \"accumulation of ammonia\" -> \"hyperammonemia\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Ornithine Transcarbamoylase (OTC) deficiency\" -> \"urea cycle disorder\" -> \"inability to convert ornithine and carbamoyl phosphate to citrulline\" -> \"accumulation of ammonia\" -> \"hyperammonemia\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Ornithine Amino Transferase deficiency\" -> \"gyrate atrophy of the choroid and retina\" -> \"does not involve urea cycle directly\" -> \"no direct accumulation of ammonia\" -> \"no hyperammonemia\" -> 90%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Citrullinemia)-CAUSES->(Hyperammonemia)-CAUSES->(Urea Cycle Disorders, Inborn)\n(ammonia)-TREATS->(Hyperammonemia)\n(ammonia)-TREATS->(Hyperammonemia)\n(ORNITHINE CARBAMOYLTRANSFERASE)-CAUSES->(Seizures)-CAUSES->(Disease)-CAUSES->(Enzyme Deficiency)-CAUSES->(Urea Cycle Disorders, Inborn)\n(ORNITHINE CARBAMOYLTRANSFERASE)-CAUSES->(Seizures)-CAUSES->(Disease)-CAUSES->(Hyperammonemia)-CAUSES->(Urea Cycle Disorders, Inborn)\n(ORNITHINE CARBAMOYLTRANSFERASE)-CAUSES->(Seizures)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Disease)-CAUSES->(Gastrointestinal Hemorrhage)-CAUSES->(Urea Cycle Disorders, Inborn)\n(ammonia)-TREATS->(Hyperammonemia)\n(Gyrate Atrophy)-CAUSES->(Atrophic)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(physiological aspects)-PROCESS_OF->(Retina)\n(Gyrate Atrophy)-CAUSES->(Atrophic)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(blood outflow)-PROCESS_OF->(Retina)\n(ammonia)-TREATS->(Hyperammonemia)\n(Urea Cycle Disorders, Inborn)-CAUSES->(Hyperammonemia)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Citrulline)\n(Citrulline)-CAUSES->(Respiration)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(ammonia)\n(Carbamoylphosphate synthetase)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cells)-LOCATION_OF->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-TREATS->(Urea Cycle Disorders, Inborn)\n(Carbamoylphosphate synthetase)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Epithelial Cells)-LOCATION_OF->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-TREATS->(Urea Cycle Disorders, Inborn)\n(Urea Cycle Disorders, Inborn)-CAUSES->(Sequela of disorder)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(physiological aspects)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(ammonia)\n(Urea Cycle Disorders, Inborn)-CAUSES->(Hyperammonemia)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Citrulline)\n(Citrulline)-CAUSES->(Respiration)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(ammonia)\n(Ornithine)-CAUSES->(Excretory function)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(ammonia)\n(Ornithine)-CAUSES->(uptake)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(ammonia)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Argininosuccinate synthetase, Carbamoyl Phosphate Synthetase (CPS-I), and Ornithine Transcarbamoylase (OTC) deficiencies are all involved in the urea cycle, leading to an inability to process ammonia into urea, thus causing hyperammonemia. This is supported by evidence linking urea cycle disorders with hyperammonemia. In contrast, Ornithine Amino Transferase deficiency primarily affects the eyes with gyrate atrophy of the choroid and retina and does not directly impact the urea cycle or cause hyperammonemia. This aligns with medical consensus and the evidence provided, which does not connect Ornithine Amino Transferase deficiency with ammonia accumulation or hyperammonemia.\"\n}",
