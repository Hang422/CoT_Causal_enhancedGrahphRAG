      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Which of the following antitussive can lead to hallucinations\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Morphine\nopb. Dextromethorphan\nopc. Diphenhydramine\nopd. Aprepitant\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Dextromethorphan\" -> \"acts on central nervous system\" -> \"can cause dissociative effects\" -> \"possible hallucinations\" -> 75%\nCHAIN: \"Morphine\" -> \"opioid receptor agonist\" -> \"primarily causes euphoria and pain relief\" -> \"hallucinations not commonly reported\" -> 20%\nCHAIN: \"Diphenhydramine\" -> \"anticholinergic properties\" -> \"can cross blood-brain barrier\" -> \"possible confusion and hallucinations in high doses\" -> 60%\nCHAIN: \"Aprepitant\" -> \"substance P/neurokinin 1 receptor antagonist\" -> \"used to prevent chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting\" -> \"hallucinations not a known side effect\" -> 10%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Pain relief)-CAUSES->(Adverse effects)-PREDISPOSES->(Hallucinations)\n(Pain relief)-PREVENTS->(Disease)-PREDISPOSES->(Hallucinations)\n(Pain relief)-PREVENTS->(Symptoms)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Hallucinations)\n(Morphine)-ISA->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Opioids)\n(Morphine)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Opioids)\n(Opioids)-PART_OF->(Brain)-PART_OF->(Muscle)-LOCATION_OF->(Pain relief)\n(Opioids)-PART_OF->(Brain)-PART_OF->(Nerve)-LOCATION_OF->(Pain relief)\n(Diphenhydramine)-ISA->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Anticholinergic Agents)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "### Enhanced Information Analysis:\n\n#### Dextromethorphan:\n- **Reasoning Chain**: Dextromethorphan acts on the central nervous system and can cause dissociative effects, including possible hallucinations.\n- **Consensus**: Dextromethorphan, when abused or taken in high doses, can indeed lead to hallucinations due to its action on the NMDA receptors, which is consistent with dissociative effects.\n- **Evidence Paths**: No direct paths provided, but the mechanism of action aligns with known pharmacological effects.\n\n#### Morphine:\n- **Reasoning Chain**: Morphine is an opioid receptor agonist primarily causing euphoria and pain relief; hallucinations are not commonly reported.\n- **Consensus**: While morphine primarily targets pain relief and euphoria, it can occasionally cause hallucinations, especially in higher doses or in sensitive individuals, but this is not typical.\n- **Evidence Paths**: The paths provided discuss opioids' general effects on the brain and pain relief but do not directly address hallucinations.\n\n#### Diphenhydramine:\n- **Reasoning Chain**: Diphenhydramine has anticholinergic properties, can cross the blood-brain barrier, and may cause confusion and hallucinations in high doses.\n- **Consensus**: Diphenhydramine, as an anticholinergic agent, can indeed lead to confusion and hallucinations, particularly in the elderly or with overdose.\n- **Evidence Paths**: The path confirms diphenhydramine as an anticholinergic agent but does not specifically address hallucinations.\n\n#### Aprepitant:\n- **Reasoning Chain**: Aprepitant is a substance P/neurokinin 1 receptor antagonist used to prevent chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting; hallucinations are not a known side effect.\n- **Consensus**: Aprepitant does not typically cause hallucinations as it primarily targets nausea and vomiting pathways.\n- **Evidence Paths**: No relevant paths provided that discuss hallucinations.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBased on the analysis, **Dextromethorphan** and **Diphenhydramine** are both capable of causing hallucinations, with Dextromethorphan having a more direct association due to its dissociative effects at high doses or abuse. Morphine can occasionally cause hallucinations, but it is not a common effect and is usually associated with other central nervous system effects. Aprepitant does not commonly cause hallucinations and is not associated with this side effect in standard medical use.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Dextromethorphan can lead to hallucinations due to its dissociative effects when abused or taken in high doses. Diphenhydramine, with its anticholinergic properties, can also cause hallucinations, especially in high doses or in sensitive populations like the elderly. Morphine, while primarily causing euphoria and pain relief, can occasionally lead to hallucinations, but this is not typical. Aprepitant does not commonly cause hallucinations as it targets nausea and vomiting pathways.\"\n}\n```",
