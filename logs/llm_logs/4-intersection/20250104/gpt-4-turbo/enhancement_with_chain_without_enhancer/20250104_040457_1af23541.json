      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        All of the following drugs are indicated in the treatment of bipolar disorder except?\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Carbamazepine\nopb. Vigabatrin\nopc. Sodium valproate\nopd. Lamotrigine\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Carbamazepine\" -> \"used as a mood stabilizer\" -> \"indicated for bipolar disorder\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Vigabatrin\" -> \"used primarily for epilepsy\" -> \"not typically indicated for bipolar disorder\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Sodium valproate\" -> \"acts as a mood stabilizer\" -> \"indicated for bipolar disorder\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Lamotrigine\" -> \"used as a mood stabilizer\" -> \"indicated for bipolar disorder\" -> 95%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Mood Stabilizer)-TREATS->(Bipolar Disorder)\n(Vigabatrin)-COMPLICATES->(Epilepsy)\n(Epilepsy)-CAUSES->(Disease)-COMPLICATES->(Bipolar Disorder)\n(Mood Stabilizer)-TREATS->(Bipolar Disorder)\n(Mood Stabilizer)-TREATS->(Bipolar Disorder)\n(Carbamazepine)-ISA->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Mood Stabilizer)\n(Carbamazepine)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Mood Stabilizer)\n(Sodium Valproate)-ISA->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Mood Stabilizer)\n(Sodium Valproate)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Mood Stabilizer)\n(lamotrigine)-ISA->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Mood Stabilizer)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "### Enhanced Information Summary\n\n1. **Carbamazepine**: This drug is indeed used as a mood stabilizer and is indicated for the treatment of bipolar disorder. The evidence path confirming Carbamazepine as a pharmaceutical preparation that interacts with mood stabilizers supports this claim, aligning with the medical consensus that mood stabilizers are effective in treating bipolar disorder.\n\n2. **Vigabatrin**: Vigabatrin is primarily used for the treatment of epilepsy and is not typically indicated for bipolar disorder. This aligns with the reasoning chain and is supported by the evidence path that directly associates Vigabatrin with epilepsy. The path suggesting complications between epilepsy and bipolar disorder does not establish Vigabatrin as a treatment for bipolar disorder, thus confirming its exclusion from typical bipolar disorder treatment regimens.\n\n3. **Sodium Valproate**: Sodium Valproate acts as a mood stabilizer and is indicated for the treatment of bipolar disorder. The evidence paths that classify Sodium Valproate as interacting with mood stabilizers reinforce its role in the treatment of bipolar disorder, consistent with medical consensus.\n\n4. **Lamotrigine**: Lamotrigine is used as a mood stabilizer and is indicated for the treatment of bipolar disorder. The evidence path categorizing Lamotrigine as a pharmaceutical preparation that interacts with mood stabilizers supports this usage, aligning with the standard medical understanding of its role in bipolar disorder treatment.\n\n### Conclusion\nAll options except Vigabatrin are indicated for the treatment of bipolar disorder. Vigabatrin, primarily used for epilepsy, lacks indication for bipolar disorder treatment, supported by its specific association with epilepsy and absence in mood stabilizer interactions relevant to bipolar disorder.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Carbamazepine, Sodium Valproate, and Lamotrigine are confirmed as mood stabilizers indicated for bipolar disorder, supported by evidence paths linking them with mood stabilizer interactions. Vigabatrin, however, is primarily used for epilepsy and is not indicated for bipolar disorder, as it lacks associations with mood stabilizer treatments relevant to bipolar disorder.\"\n}\n```",
