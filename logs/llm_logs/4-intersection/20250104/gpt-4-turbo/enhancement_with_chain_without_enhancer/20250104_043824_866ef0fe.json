  "response": "### Enhanced Information Summary\n\n1. **Huminsulin and Insulin Resistance**: The claim that insulin resistance is more common with huminsulin contradicts medical consensus. Huminsulin, being a synthetic form of human insulin, generally has a resistance profile similar to other types of insulin. Therefore, it is unlikely to specifically cause a higher incidence of insulin resistance compared to other insulin types. This aligns with the understanding that synthetic insulins mimic natural human insulin and thus share similar biochemical interactions and resistance profiles.\n\n2. **Infections and Insulin Resistance**: Infections can indeed lead to increased insulin resistance. This is due to the body's stress response, which elevates counter-regulatory hormones such as glucagon, cortisol, and epinephrine. These hormones counteract the effects of insulin and can temporarily increase insulin resistance to mobilize energy for the immune response. This reasoning is well-supported by medical consensus and aligns with the physiological responses observed during infections.\n\n3. **Antibodies to Insulin and Insulin Resistance**: The presence of antibodies against insulin, a phenomenon sometimes observed in patients, particularly those using exogenous insulin, can lead to insulin resistance. These antibodies can bind to insulin, reducing its efficacy and thereby increasing insulin resistance. This mechanism is recognized in immunology and endocrinology, confirming the validity of this option.\n\n4. **Glucocorticoids and Insulin Resistance**: The use of glucocorticoids is known to increase blood glucose levels and exacerbate insulin resistance. Glucocorticoids stimulate gluconeogenesis, increase the breakdown of fats and proteins, and reduce the uptake of glucose by the cells, all of which contribute to higher blood glucose levels and increased insulin resistance. Therefore, glucocorticoids are generally not useful in managing severe cases of insulin resistance; in fact, they are likely to worsen the condition. This contradicts the claim in the option and aligns with the consensus that glucocorticoids should be used cautiously in diabetic patients due to their potential to impair glucose control.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe statement that \"Use of glucocorticoids may be useful in severe cases\" of insulin resistance is incorrect according to medical consensus and the known effects of glucocorticoids on blood glucose and insulin sensitivity. The other options are consistent with established medical knowledge regarding the causes and exacerbating factors of insulin resistance.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Huminsulin does not cause more common insulin resistance compared to other insulin types. Infections elevate stress hormones, increasing insulin resistance. Antibodies to insulin can reduce its efficacy, thus increasing resistance. Glucocorticoids, contrary to improving severe insulin resistance, actually worsen it by increasing blood glucose levels and impairing insulin action.\"\n}\n```",
