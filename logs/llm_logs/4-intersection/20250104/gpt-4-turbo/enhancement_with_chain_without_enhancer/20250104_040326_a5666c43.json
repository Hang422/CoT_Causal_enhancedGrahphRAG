  "response": "### Enhanced Information Summary\n\nAldosterone is a steroid hormone that plays a crucial role in regulating sodium and potassium levels in the body, which in turn affects blood pressure and fluid balance. It primarily acts by binding to mineralocorticoid receptors, which are predominantly located in the kidney cells of the distal tubules and the collecting duct.\n\n1. **Distal Tubules**: Aldosterone's action in the distal tubules involves increasing sodium reabsorption and enhancing potassium excretion. This is a key mechanism by which aldosterone helps in maintaining electrolyte balance and blood volume. The reasoning chain and evidence paths confirm aldosterone's interaction with mineralocorticoid receptors and its role in modulating renal cell function, specifically pointing to its significant effects in the distal tubules.\n\n2. **Collecting Duct**: Aldosterone also acts on the collecting ducts, where it aids in sodium reabsorption and water retention, further contributing to the regulation of blood pressure and fluid balance. The evidence paths, while broad, support the interaction of aldosterone with renal cells, which are present in the collecting duct, aligning with the known physiological roles of aldosterone in these locations.\n\nThe evidence paths related to breast collecting duct and other broad associations such as with diseases or macrophage activation syndrome are not directly relevant to the specific question of aldosterone's action in kidney structures and have been excluded from the decision-making process.\n\nIn conclusion, aldosterone primarily acts on the distal tubules and the collecting duct of the kidney, where it binds to mineralocorticoid receptors to regulate electrolyte balance and blood pressure. This action is crucial for maintaining homeostasis in the body.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Aldosterone primarily acts on the distal tubules and the collecting duct of the kidney.
