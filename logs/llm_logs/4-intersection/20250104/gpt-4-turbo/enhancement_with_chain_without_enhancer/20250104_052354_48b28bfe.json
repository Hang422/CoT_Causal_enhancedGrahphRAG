      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        A 52 year old male presents to his physician with a chief complaint of a substantial increase in the size of his breasts over the past few months. Three months ago he was diagnosed with hypeension, and placed on antihypeensive medication. Which of the following medications was most likely prescribed?\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Captopril\nopb. Furosemide\nopc. Hydrochlorothiazide\nopd. Spironolactone\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Spironolactone\" -> \"antagonizes androgen receptors\" -> \"increases estrogen activity\" -> \"gynecomastia development\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Captopril\" -> \"ACE inhibitor\" -> \"no direct link to hormonal changes affecting breast size\" -> \"unlikely to cause gynecomastia\" -> 10%\nCHAIN: \"Furosemide\" -> \"loop diuretic\" -> \"no significant hormonal effects\" -> \"unlikely to cause gynecomastia\" -> 10%\nCHAIN: \"Hydrochlorothiazide\" -> \"thiazide diuretic\" -> \"no significant hormonal effects\" -> \"unlikely to cause gynecomastia\" -> 10%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Spironolactone)-PART_OF->(Cells)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Androgen Receptor)\n(Spironolactone)-PART_OF->(Cells)-LOCATION_OF->(Androgen Receptor)\n(Captopril)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors)\n(Furosemide)-ISA->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Loop Diuretics)\n(Furosemide)-PART_OF->(Cells)-LOCATION_OF->(Loop Diuretics)\n(Hydrochlorothiazide)-ISA->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Thiazide Diuretics)\n(Hydrochlorothiazide)-CAUSES->(Excretory function)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Thiazide Diuretics)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"The most likely medication prescribed that could cause an increase in breast size (gynecomastia) in a 52-year-old male diagnosed with hypertension is Spironolactone. Spironolactone acts as an antagonist to androgen receptors, which can increase estrogen activity, leading to the development of gynecomastia. This aligns with the evidence path showing Spironolactone's interaction with androgen receptors. Other medications such as Captopril, Furosemide, and Hydrochlorothiazide, primarily act as ACE inhibitors and diuretics respectively, and do not significantly affect hormonal balances related to breast tissue growth, making them unlikely to cause gynecomastia.\"\n}",
