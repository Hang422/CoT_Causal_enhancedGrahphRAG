Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4.

Small intestine\nopd. Large intestine\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Disaccharides ingestion\" -> \"Salivary amylase in mouth begins starch breakdown, not disaccharides\" -> \"Disaccharides remain intact\" -> \"Small intestine\" -> \"Disaccharidases like lactase, sucrase break down disaccharides into monosaccharides\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Disaccharides ingestion\" -> \"Stomach acid deactivates salivary amylase\" -> \"No significant disaccharide digestion in stomach\" -> \"Small intestine\" -> \"Enzymatic action on disaccharides\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Disaccharides reach large intestine\" -> \"No significant disaccharide-digesting enzymes present\" -> \"Fermentation by microbiota, not digestion\" -> \"Incorrect location for disaccharide digestion\" -> 5%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Disaccharides)-CAUSES->(Disease)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Excretory function)-PROCESS_OF->(Intestines, Small)\n(Disaccharides)-CAUSES->(Disease)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(biological adaptation to stress)-PROCESS_OF->(Intestines, Small)\n(Disaccharides)-CAUSES->(Diastasis)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(biological adaptation to stress)-PROCESS_OF->(Intestines, Small)\n(Disaccharides)-CAUSES->(Disease)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Excretory function)-PROCESS_OF->(Intestines, Small)\n(Disaccharides)-CAUSES->(Disease)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(biological adaptation to stress)-PROCESS_OF->(Intestines, Small)\n(Disaccharides)-CAUSES->(Diastasis)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(biological adaptation to stress)-PROCESS_OF->(Intestines, Small)\n(Disaccharides)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Fructose)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Starch)\n(Disaccharides)-ISA->(Sugars)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Starch)\n(Salivary amylase)-CAUSES->(Myalgia)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Disease)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Cyanobacterium)-LOCATION_OF->(Disaccharides)\n(Salivary amylase)-CAUSES->(Myalgia)-CAUSES->(Disease)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Cyanobacterium)-LOCATION_OF->(Disaccharides)\n(Starch)-ISA->(Polysaccharides)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Disaccharides)\n(Starch)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Enzymes)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Disaccharides)\n(Intestines, Small)-LOCATION_OF->(Hyperplasia)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Disaccharidases)\n(Intestines, Small)-LOCATION_OF->(Graft vs Host Reaction)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Disaccharidases)\n(Salivary amylase)-CAUSES->(Myalgia)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Disease)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Cyanobacterium)-LOCATION_OF->(Disaccharides)\n(Salivary amylase)-CAUSES->(Myalgia)-CAUSES->(Disease)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Cyanobacterium)-LOCATION_OF->(Disaccharides)\n(Stomach)-PART_OF->(Intestines, Small)\n(Intestines, Small)-LOCATION_OF->(Disaccharides)\n(Disaccharides)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Enzymes)\n(Intestines)-LOCATION_OF->(Enzymes)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Digestion of disaccharides primarily occurs in the small intestine. Disaccharides such as sucrose, lactose, and maltose are broken down into monosaccharides by specific enzymes called disaccharidases, including lactase, sucrase, and maltase, which are located in the small intestine. This is supported by the evidence path indicating the presence of disaccharidases in the small intestine. The mouth, through the action of salivary amylase, initiates the breakdown of polysaccharides like starch into smaller chains and some maltose, but not the digestion of disaccharides. The stomach's acidic environment deactivates salivary amylase and does not facilitate significant disaccharide digestion. The large intestine does not have disaccharidase enzymes and mainly involves the fermentation of undigested carbohydrates by microbiota. Therefore, the correct answer to where disaccharide digestion occurs is the small intestine.\"\n}",
