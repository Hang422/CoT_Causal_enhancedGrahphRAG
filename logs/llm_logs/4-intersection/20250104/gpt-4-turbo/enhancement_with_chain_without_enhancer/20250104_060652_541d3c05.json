      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        The drug which does not cause myopathy is :\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Chloroquine\nopb. Betamethasone\nopc. Chloramphenicol\nopd. Zidovudine\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Chloroquine\" -> \"known to cause myopathy\" -> low confidence in not causing myopathy -> 10%\nCHAIN: \"Betamethasone\" -> \"corticosteroid\" -> \"possible muscle weakness and myopathy with long-term use\" -> low confidence in not causing myopathy -> 20%\nCHAIN: \"Chloramphenicol\" -> \"antibiotic\" -> \"not commonly associated with myopathy\" -> high confidence in not causing myopathy -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Zidovudine\" -> \"antiretroviral\" -> \"known to cause myopathy\" -> low confidence in not causing myopathy -> 10%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Chloroquine)-TREATS->(Myopathy)\n(Adrenal Cortex Hormones)-CAUSES->(Myopathy)\n(Paresis)-CAUSES->(Disease)-CAUSES->(Myopathy)\n(Anti-Retroviral Agents)-CAUSES->(Adverse effects)-CAUSES->(Myopathy)\n(Anti-Retroviral Agents)-PREDISPOSES->(Infection)-CAUSES->(Myopathy)\n(Anti-Retroviral Agents)-TREATS->(Disease)-CAUSES->(Myopathy)\n(Betamethasone)-ISA->(Adrenal Cortex Hormones)\n(Betamethasone)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Adrenal Cortex Hormones)\n(Zidovudine)-PREVENTS->(Virus)-LOCATION_OF->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Anti-Retroviral Agents)\n(Zidovudine)-TREATS->(Virus)-LOCATION_OF->(Lipids)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Anti-Retroviral Agents)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Chloroquine is known to cause myopathy, as supported by evidence paths directly linking Chloroquine to the treatment of Myopathy. Betamethasone, a corticosteroid, can cause muscle weakness and myopathy, particularly with long-term use, which aligns with the general effects of adrenal cortex hormones on myopathy. Zidovudine, an antiretroviral agent, is also associated with myopathy, corroborated by evidence paths linking anti-retroviral agents to adverse effects including myopathy. In contrast, Chloramphenicol, an antibiotic, is not commonly associated with myopathy, and there is no direct evidence linking it to myopathy in the retrieved paths. Therefore, Chloramphenicol is the drug among the options that does not cause myopathy.\"\n}",
