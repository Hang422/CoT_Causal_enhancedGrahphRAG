Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Tocilizumab used against Rheumatoid arthritis is a monoclonal antibody against :\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Interleukin-6\nopb. Interleukin-6 receptor\nopc. Interleukin-5\nopd. Interleukin-5 receptor\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Tocilizumab\" -> \"monoclonal antibody\" -> \"targets specific proteins\" -> \"Interleukin-6 receptor\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Tocilizumab\" -> \"used in Rheumatoid arthritis\" -> \"acts on immune system\" -> \"Interleukin-6 receptor\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Tocilizumab\" -> \"biologic drug\" -> \"binds to receptors\" -> \"Interleukin-6 receptor\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Tocilizumab\" -> \"therapeutic antibody\" -> \"interferes with cytokine interaction\" -> \"Interleukin-6 receptor\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Tocilizumab\" -> \"designed to block specific molecules\" -> \"targets receptor of cytokine\" -> \"Interleukin-6 receptor\" -> 95%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(tocilizumab)-TREATS->(Rheumatoid Arthritis)\n(tocilizumab)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Monoclonal Antibodies)\n(tocilizumab)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cells)-LOCATION_OF->(Monoclonal Antibodies)\n(Monoclonal Antibodies)-INTERACTS_WITH->(T-Lymphocyte)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Proteins)\n(Monoclonal Antibodies)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Proteins)\n(Proteins)-PART_OF->(Cells)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Interleukin 6 Receptor)\n(Proteins)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cells)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Interleukin 6 Receptor)\n(Immune system)-LOCATION_OF->(Psychotherapy, Multiple)-CAUSES->(Infiltration)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Interleukin 6 Receptor)\n(Immune system)-LOCATION_OF->(Psychotherapy, Multiple)-TREATS->(Infiltration)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Interleukin 6 Receptor)\n(cytokine)-INTERACTS_WITH->(T-Lymphocyte)-LOCATION_OF->(Interleukin 6 Receptor)\n(cytokine)-PART_OF->(Cells)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Interleukin 6 Receptor)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "### Standard Consensus Facts:\nTocilizumab is a monoclonal antibody used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. It specifically targets the interleukin-6 receptor (IL-6R), not interleukin-6 itself, nor interleukin-5 or its receptor. By binding to IL-6R, tocilizumab inhibits the pro-inflammatory effects mediated by IL-6, a cytokine involved in the immune response.\n\n### Evaluation of Reasoning Chains and Evidence Paths:\n- All reasoning chains correctly identify tocilizumab as targeting the \"Interleukin-6 receptor.\" This is consistent with medical consensus.\n- The evidence paths that link tocilizumab with interactions involving monoclonal antibodies and the interleukin-6 receptor support the reasoning chains. Specifically, the paths:\n  - (Proteins)-PART_OF->(Cells)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Interleukin 6 Receptor)\n  - (Proteins)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cells)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Interleukin 6 Receptor)\n  - (cytokine)-PART_OF->(Cells)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Interleukin 6 Receptor)\n  - (cytokine)-INTERACTS_WITH->(T-Lymphocyte)-LOCATION_OF->(Interleukin 6 Receptor)\n  These paths confirm the interaction of tocilizumab with the interleukin-6 receptor, reinforcing the accuracy of the reasoning chains.\n\n- Other evidence paths mentioning general interactions with pharmaceutical preparations, cells, and the immune system are too broad and do not specifically support the precise mechanism of action of tocilizumab. Therefore, they are not included in the enhanced information.\n\n### Enhanced Information:\nTocilizumab, a monoclonal antibody used in treating rheumatoid arthritis, specifically targets the interleukin-6 receptor (IL-6R). This action blocks the receptor's interaction with interleukin-6, a key cytokine involved in inflammatory processes. Evidence confirms tocilizumab's interaction with IL-6R, aligning with its known mechanism of inhibiting the pro-inflammatory effects mediated by IL-6.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Tocilizumab, a monoclonal antibody used in treating rheumatoid arthritis, specifically targets the interleukin-6 receptor (IL-6R).
