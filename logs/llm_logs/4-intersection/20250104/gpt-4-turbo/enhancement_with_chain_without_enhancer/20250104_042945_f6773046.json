      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Ivermectin is indicated in all of the following except:\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Ascaris\nopb. Filariasis\nopc. Malaria\nopd. Oncocerciasis\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Ivermectin\" -> \"targets parasitic infections\" -> \"effective against Ascaris\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Ivermectin\" -> \"targets parasitic infections\" -> \"used in treatment of Filariasis\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Ivermectin\" -> \"targets parasitic infections\" -> \"used in treatment of Oncocerciasis\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Ivermectin\" -> \"targets parasitic infections\" -> \"not effective against Plasmodium species\" -> \"not used in Malaria treatment\" -> 90%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Ivermectin)-TREATS->(Parasitic Diseases)\n(Ivermectin)-TREATS->(Parasitic Diseases)\n(Parasitic Diseases)-CAUSES->(Infection)-CAUSES->(Filariasis)\n(Parasitic Diseases)-CAUSES->(Chronic infectious disease)-CAUSES->(Filariasis)\n(Parasitic Diseases)-CAUSES->(Malaria)-CAUSES->(Filariasis)\n(Ivermectin)-TREATS->(Parasitic Diseases)\n(Ivermectin)-TREATS->(Parasitic Diseases)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2.

Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "### Enhanced Information Summary\n\nIvermectin is a well-known antiparasitic medication primarily used for treating several parasitic infections. According to medical consensus:\n\n1. **Ascaris (Roundworms)**: Ivermectin is effective against Ascaris infections. This aligns with the reasoning chain and is supported by the general evidence that Ivermectin treats parasitic diseases.\n\n2. **Filariasis**: Ivermectin is commonly used in the treatment of filariasis, specifically for lymphatic filariasis caused by Wuchereria bancrofti, Brugia malayi, and Brugia timori. This is consistent with the reasoning chain and is corroborated by the evidence paths linking parasitic diseases to filariasis.\n\n3. **Oncocerciasis (River Blindness)**: Ivermectin is a primary treatment for onchocerciasis, effectively reducing the microfilarial load in infected individuals. This matches the reasoning chain and is supported by the broad evidence of Ivermectin's role in treating parasitic diseases.\n\n4. **Malaria**: Ivermectin is not indicated for the treatment of malaria, as it is not effective against the Plasmodium species that cause malaria. This is accurately reflected in the reasoning chain. The evidence path suggesting a link between parasitic diseases and malaria is misleading in this context, as it does not pertain to the effectiveness of Ivermectin against malaria.\n\nIn conclusion, the correct answer to the question \"Ivermectin is indicated in all of the following except:\" is **Malaria**. The reasoning chains for Ascaris, Filariasis, and Oncocerciasis are consistent with medical consensus and supported by evidence paths, whereas the chain for Malaria correctly identifies the lack of efficacy of Ivermectin against this disease, despite the broad and irrelevant evidence path linking parasitic diseases to malaria.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Ivermectin is effective against Ascaris, Filariasis, and Oncocerciasis, aligning with its known antiparasitic properties. However, it is not indicated for Malaria, as it does not target the Plasmodium species responsible for the disease. The reasoning chains for Ascaris, Filariasis, and Oncocerciasis are supported by evidence, while the chain for Malaria correctly notes Ivermectin's ineffectiveness against this infection, despite misleading broad evidence paths.\"\n}\n```",
