      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        In which of the following patients would enalapril be the best first line agent for high blood pressure control ?\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. A 62 year old man with renal artery stenosis\nopb. A 32 year old pregnant female\nopc. A 41 year old woman with hyperkalemia\nopd. A 56 year old diabetic woman\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"62 year old man with renal artery stenosis\" -> \"enalapril use\" -> \"risk of worsening renal function due to decreased renal perfusion\" -> \"not recommended\" -> 10%\nCHAIN: \"32 year old pregnant female\" -> \"enalapril use\" -> \"potential teratogenic effects on fetus\" -> \"contraindicated in pregnancy\" -> 5%\nCHAIN: \"41 year old woman with hyperkalemia\" -> \"enalapril use\" -> \"increased risk of further elevating potassium levels\" -> \"potentially dangerous\" -> 15%\nCHAIN: \"56 year old diabetic woman\" -> \"enalapril use\" -> \"protective effect on kidneys in diabetic nephropathy\" -> \"recommended for diabetic patients with hypertension\" -> 85%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Enalapril)-CAUSES->(Disease)-CAUSES->(Teratogenesis)\n(Enalapril)-PREDISPOSES->(Hypertensive disease)-COMPLICATES->(Teratogenesis)\n(Enalapril)-PREVENTS->(Obesity)-CAUSES->(Teratogenesis)\n(Enalapril)-PREVENTS->(Diabetic Nephropathy)\n(Diabetic Nephropathy)-CAUSES->(Hypertensive disease)\n(Renal Artery Stenosis)-PREDISPOSES->(Fibrosis)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Enalapril)\n(Renal Artery Stenosis)-CAUSES->(Fibrosis)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Enalapril)\n(hyperkalemia)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Enalapril)\n(Kidney)-LOCATION_OF->(Hypertensive disease)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Enalapril, an ACE inhibitor, is generally contraindicated in pregnancy due to potential teratogenic effects, making it unsuitable for a 32-year-old pregnant female. In patients with renal artery stenosis, such as the 62-year-old man, enalapril can exacerbate renal function decline by reducing renal perfusion, hence it is not recommended. For a 41-year-old woman with hyperkalemia, enalapril could dangerously elevate potassium levels further, making it an inappropriate choice. However, enalapril is beneficial in diabetic patients by providing a protective effect against diabetic nephropathy, making it a suitable first-line agent for a 56-year-old diabetic woman with hypertension. This aligns with medical consensus and is supported by evidence indicating enalapril's preventive role in diabetic nephropathy.\"\n}",
