  "response": "### Enhanced Information Summary\n\nAspirin is known to inhibit the cyclooxygenase enzyme, which leads to a reduction in thromboxane A2 production. Thromboxane A2 is crucial for platelet aggregation; thus, its reduction impairs this process and results in platelet dysfunction. This effect of aspirin increases the risk of bleeding, particularly when used in conjunction with anticoagulants like heparin. Heparin acts by enhancing the activity of antithrombin III, which inhibits thrombin and factor Xa, crucial components in the clotting cascade. The combination of aspirin and heparin can therefore lead to a significantly increased risk of bleeding due to their complementary actions on different parts of the clotting process.\n\nThe evidence paths confirm that both aspirin and heparin are associated with increased bleeding risks, though they act through different mechanisms. The paths also show that aspirin's effect on platelet dysfunction is well-documented and directly contributes to its bleeding risk, which is exacerbated when combined with heparin. There is no evidence to support that aspirin inhibits the action of heparin directly, affects heparin hypersensitivity, or impacts the monitoring of heparin therapy through aPTT measurements.\n\nTherefore, the primary reason aspirin is not given to a patient already on heparin is due to the increased risk of bleeding stemming from aspirin-induced platelet dysfunction, which exacerbates the anticoagulant effect of heparin.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Aspirin inhibits the cyclooxygenase enzyme, reducing thromboxane A2 production and impairing platelet aggregation, leading to platelet dysfunction and increased bleeding risk. When combined with heparin, which acts by enhancing antithrombin III activity to inhibit clotting factors, the risk of bleeding is further increased. Evidence confirms the separate but complementary bleeding risks associated with each drug, highlighting the danger of their combined use without direct interaction between the two drugs.\"\n}\n```",
