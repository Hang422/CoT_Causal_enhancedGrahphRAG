      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Aspirin is contraindicated in?\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Fever\nopb. Peptic ulcer\nopc. Unstable angina\nopd. Myalgia\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Aspirin\" -> \"inhibits prostaglandins\" -> \"increases stomach acid secretion\" -> \"aggravates peptic ulcer\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Aspirin\" -> \"anti-inflammatory properties\" -> \"reduces fever\" -> \"not contraindicated in fever\" -> 10%\nCHAIN: \"Aspirin\" -> \"antiplatelet effect\" -> \"prevents blood clot formation\" -> \"beneficial in unstable angina\" -> 10%\nCHAIN: \"Aspirin\" -> \"reduces inflammation\" -> \"alleviates pain from myalgia\" -> \"not contraindicated in myalgia\" -> 10%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Aspirin)-PREDISPOSES->(Inflammation)\n(Inflammation)-PREDISPOSES->(Myalgia)\n(Pain)-CAUSES->(Myalgia)\n(Aspirin)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Prostaglandins)\n(Aspirin)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Pathogenesis)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Prostaglandins)\n(Aspirin)-ISA->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Antiplatelet)\n(Aspirin)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Antiplatelet)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Aspirin is contraindicated in peptic ulcer due to its mechanism of inhibiting prostaglandins, which leads to an increase in stomach acid secretion and can aggravate peptic ulcers. This is supported by the evidence path linking aspirin with prostaglandins and their role in gastric physiology. In contrast, aspirin is not contraindicated in fever, unstable angina, or myalgia. It has anti-inflammatory properties that reduce fever and alleviate pain from myalgia, and its antiplatelet effect is beneficial in preventing blood clot formation, which is crucial in the management of unstable angina.\"\n}",
