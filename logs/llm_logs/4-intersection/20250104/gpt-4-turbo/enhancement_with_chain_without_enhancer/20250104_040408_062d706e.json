      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Which of the following drugs is useful in prophylaxis of motion sickness?\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Hyoscine\nopb. Metoclopramide\nopc. Prochlorperazine\nopd. Ondansetron\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Hyoscine\" -> \"blocks muscarinic receptors\" -> \"prevents nausea and vomiting associated with motion sickness\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Metoclopramide\" -> \"enhances gastric emptying\" -> \"not primarily used for motion sickness\" -> \"possible mild effectiveness\" -> 30%\nCHAIN: \"Prochlorperazine\" -> \"blocks dopamine receptors\" -> \"used for nausea and vomiting\" -> \"less effective for motion sickness specifically\" -> 40%\nCHAIN: \"Ondansetron\" -> \"blocks serotonin receptors\" -> \"effective for postoperative and chemotherapy-induced nausea\" -> \"not the first choice for motion sickness\" -> 25%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Muscarinic Acetylcholine Receptor)-CAUSES->(Diarrhea)-CAUSES->(Vomiting)\n(Muscarinic Acetylcholine Receptor)-CAUSES->(Tremor)-CAUSES->(Vomiting)\n(Muscarinic Acetylcholine Receptor)-CAUSES->(Absence of pain sensation)-CAUSES->(Vomiting)\n(Obstruction)-CAUSES->(Disease)-CAUSES->(Vomiting)\n(Obstruction)-CAUSES->(Infection)-CAUSES->(Vomiting)\n(Obstruction)-CAUSES->(Hypertensive disease)-CAUSES->(Vomiting)\n(Dopamine Receptor)-CAUSES->(Symptoms)-CAUSES->([D]Nausea and vomiting NOS)\n(Obstruction)-CAUSES->(Stroke, Acute)-CAUSES->([D]Nausea and vomiting NOS)\n(Obstruction)-CAUSES->(Dehydration)-CAUSES->([D]Nausea and vomiting NOS)\n(Obstruction)-CAUSES->(Kidney Failure, Acute)-CAUSES->([D]Nausea and vomiting NOS)\n([D]Nausea and vomiting NOS)-CAUSES->(Gastrointestinal symptoms NOS)-CAUSES->(Motion Sickness)\n([D]Nausea and vomiting NOS)-CAUSES->(Vomiting)-CAUSES->(Motion Sickness)\n(Scopolamine)-TREATS->(Pathological Dilatation)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Muscarinic Acetylcholine Receptor)\n(Scopolamine)-CAUSES->(Functional disorder)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Muscarinic Acetylcholine Receptor)\n(Prochlorperazine)-TREATS->(Adverse effects)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Dopamine Receptor)\n(Ondansetron)-TREATS->(Disease)-PREDISPOSES->(Pathogenesis)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(serotonin receptor)\n(Ondansetron)-TREATS->(Disease)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Pathogenesis)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(serotonin receptor)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Hyoscine, also known as scopolamine, is the most effective drug for the prophylaxis of motion sickness. It works by blocking muscarinic receptors, which helps prevent the nausea and vomiting associated with motion sickness. This is supported by evidence paths linking scopolamine to the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor, which is involved in the pathways causing vomiting. Other options like Metoclopramide, Prochlorperazine, and Ondansetron, although they have roles in managing nausea and vomiting, are not primarily used for motion sickness. Metoclopramide enhances gastric emptying and is more suited for conditions where delayed gastric emptying is an issue, not specifically motion sickness. Prochlorperazine and Ondansetron are more effective in other types of nausea like those induced by chemotherapy or postoperative conditions but are less effective or not the first choice for motion sickness.\"\n}",
