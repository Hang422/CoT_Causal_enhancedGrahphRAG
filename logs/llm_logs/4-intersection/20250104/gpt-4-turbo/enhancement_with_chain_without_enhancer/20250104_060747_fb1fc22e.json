  "response": "### Enhanced Information Summary\n\nChronic use of NSAIDs leads to a decrease in prostaglandin synthesis, which is crucial for gastric mucosal protection and regulation of gastric acid secretion. This reduction in prostaglandins results in increased vulnerability of the stomach lining to acid, thereby promoting peptic ulcer formation.\n\n1. **Misoprostol** is a prostaglandin analog that compensates for the decreased prostaglandin synthesis caused by NSAIDs. It not only increases mucosal protection but also moderately decreases acid secretion, directly addressing the pathophysiological changes induced by NSAIDs. This makes misoprostol particularly effective in preventing and treating NSAID-induced peptic ulcers. The evidence paths confirm Misoprostol's role in treating diseases associated with decreased prostaglandin levels, supporting its use in this context.\n\n2. **Esomeprazole**, a proton pump inhibitor (PPI), effectively reduces stomach acid production, which allows for the healing of ulcers. While PPIs like esomeprazole are commonly used for peptic ulcers, their primary action does not address the underlying problem of decreased mucosal protection caused by NSAIDs. However, they are still considered a valuable treatment option, especially in cases where acid suppression is needed.\n\n3. **Pirenzepine** works as an M1 muscarinic receptor antagonist, reducing gastric acid secretion. However, it does not enhance mucosal protection, which is a critical factor in NSAID-induced peptic ulcer disease. Thus, while it can be used for general peptic ulcers, it is less effective than misoprostol for NSAID-induced conditions.\n\n4. **Loratadine** is an antihistamine targeting the H1 receptor, primarily used for allergies and has no significant effect on gastric acid secretion or mucosal protection. It is not suitable for treating peptic ulcers, as confirmed by the evidence paths that do not support its use in this context.\n\nIn conclusion, for peptic ulcers specifically caused by the chronic use of NSAIDs, **misoprostol** is the most appropriate choice due to its dual action of replacing decreased prostaglandins and providing mucosal protection. Esomeprazole serves as an alternative primarily for its acid-suppressive effects, while pirenzepine and loratadine are less suitable due to their mechanisms not directly addressing the primary pathophysiological changes induced by NSAIDs.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"For peptic ulcers induced by chronic NSAID use, misoprostol is the preferred treatment due to its prostaglandin analog properties that directly counteract the drug-induced decrease in gastric mucosal protection and moderate acid secretion. Esomeprazole can be used as an alternative for its acid-suppressive effects. Pirenzepine and loratadine are less effective as they do not address the critical issue of mucosal protection.\"\n}\n```",
