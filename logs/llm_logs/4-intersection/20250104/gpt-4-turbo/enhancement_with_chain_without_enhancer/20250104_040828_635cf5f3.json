Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "### Enhanced Information Summary\n\nThe patient's symptoms of deafness and tinnitus are most likely caused by the use of Streptomycin. Streptomycin is an aminoglycoside antibiotic known for its ototoxic effects, which can damage the auditory nerve leading to hearing loss and tinnitus. This aligns with the standard medical consensus that aminoglycosides, including Streptomycin, are associated with ototoxicity. The evidence path linking Streptomycin with ototoxicity through its classification as an aminoglycoside antibiotic supports this reasoning.\n\nFor the other options:\n- Isoniazid is primarily associated with peripheral neuropathy and less commonly affects the auditory nerve, making it a less likely cause of the patient's symptoms.\n- Ethambutol is more commonly linked to visual disturbances rather than auditory issues, making it an unlikely cause of deafness and tinnitus.\n- Rifampicin is not typically associated with ototoxic effects, further supporting its unlikelihood in causing the patient's auditory symptoms.\n\nThe retrieved evidence paths regarding ototoxicity and its association with auditory symptoms like tinnitus further reinforce the conclusion that Streptomycin, due to its ototoxic potential among the antitubercular agents, is the most probable cause of the patient's complaints.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Streptomycin, an aminoglycoside antibiotic, is known for its ototoxic effects, which can damage the auditory nerve leading to symptoms such as deafness and tinnitus.
