      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Biochemistry.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        True statement regarding insulin:\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Produced by alpha cells of pancreas\nopb. Two polypeptide chains are bound by disulfide linkages\nopc. Shifts potassium outside the cell\nopd. S.c insulin tl/2 is 60 mins\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Insulin\" -> \"produced by beta cells of pancreas\" -> \"not produced by alpha cells\" -> 5%\nCHAIN: s connected by disulfide bonds\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Insulin function\" -> \"increases cellular uptake of potassium\" -> \"shifts potassium into the cell\" -> 5%\nCHAIN: \"Insulin administration\" -> \"subcutaneous injection\" -> \"half-life approximately 5-6 minutes\" -> \"not 60 minutes\" -> 5%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Insulin)-CAUSES->(Energy Metabolism)-PROCESS_OF->(Pancreas)\n(Insulin)-CAUSES->(physiological aspects)-PROCESS_OF->(Pancreas)\n(Insulin)-CAUSES->(Excretory function)-PROCESS_OF->(Pancreas)\n(potassium)-TREATS->(Diabetes)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(GLUCOSE TOLERANCE)-PROCESS_OF->(Cells)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "### Enhanced Information Summary\n\n1. **Option A: Produced by alpha cells of pancreas**\n   - **Consensus Fact**: Insulin is produced by the beta cells of the pancreas, not the alpha cells. Alpha cells primarily produce glucagon.\n   - **Corrected Chain**: Insulin is produced by beta cells of the pancreas.\n   - **Relevant Evidence Path**: None of the provided paths directly address the cellular origin of insulin within the pancreas.\n\n2. **Option B: Two polypeptide chains are bound by disulfide linkages**\n   - **Consensus Fact**: Insulin is indeed composed of two polypeptide chains (A and B chains) that are connected by disulfide bonds.\n   - **Corrected Chain**: Insulin's structure includes two polypeptide chains linked by disulfide bonds.\n   - **Relevant Evidence Path**: The paths provided do not specifically discuss the molecular structure of insulin, so they are not directly relevant here.\n\n3. **Option C: Shifts potassium outside the cell**\n   - **Consensus Fact**: Insulin promotes the uptake of potassium into the cells, not the expulsion of potassium from cells.\n   - **Corrected Chain**: Insulin increases the cellular uptake of potassium, shifting potassium into the cell.\n   - **Relevant Evidence Path**: The path mentioning potassium and diabetes is broadly related to metabolic processes but does not clarify the specific action of insulin on potassium transport.\n\n4. **Option D: S.c insulin t1/2 is 60 mins**\n   - **Consensus Fact**: The half-life of subcutaneously administered insulin is typically around 5-6 minutes, not 60 minutes.\n   - **Corrected Chain**: The half-life of subcutaneously administered insulin is approximately 5-6 minutes.\n   - **Relevant Evidence Path**: None of the paths provided discuss the pharmacokinetics of insulin, such as its half-life.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe only true statement about insulin among the options, based on medical consensus and corrected reasoning chains, is option B: \"Two polypeptide chains are bound by disulfide linkages.\" The evidence paths provided do not add significant information to directly support or refute the specific details required to answer the question correctly.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"The only correct statement about insulin among the options is that it consists of two polypeptide chains bound by disulfide linkages. Insulin is produced by beta cells of the pancreas, not alpha cells, and it increases the uptake of potassium into cells, contrary to shifting it outside. The half-life of subcutaneously administered insulin is approximately 5-6 minutes, not 60 minutes. The provided evidence paths do not directly support these specific biochemical details.\"\n}\n```",
