      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Drug of choice in pneumonia caused by P. carinii is :\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Penicillin\nopb. Cotrimoxazole\nopc. Kanamycin\nopd. Levofloxacin\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"P. carinii infection\" -> \"requires specific antimicrobial therapy\" -> \"Cotrimoxazole is recommended for Pneumocystis pneumonia\" -> \"Cotrimoxazole effectively treats P. carinii\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"P. carinii infection\" -> \"Penicillin targets bacterial cell walls\" -> \"P. carinii is a fungus-like organism, not affected by Penicillin\" -> \"Penicillin not effective against P. carinii\" -> 10%\nCHAIN: \"P. carinii infection\" -> \"Kanamycin is an aminoglycoside antibiotic\" -> \"Aminoglycosides are not effective against Pneumocystis pneumonia\" -> \"Kanamycin not suitable for P. carinii\" -> 10%\nCHAIN: \"P. carinii infection\" -> \"Levofloxacin is a broad-spectrum antibiotic\" -> \"Levofloxacin not first-line for Pneumocystis pneumonia\" -> \"Levofloxacin less effective than Cotrimoxazole for P. carinii\" -> 30%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Aminoglycosides)-CAUSES->(Adverse effects)-CAUSES->(Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia)\n(Aminoglycosides)-CAUSES->(Disease)-PREDISPOSES->(Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia)\n(Aminoglycosides)-TREATS->(Tuberculosis)-CAUSES->(Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia)\n(Levofloxacin)-TREATS->(Tuberculosis)-CAUSES->(Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia)\n(Levofloxacin)-TREATS->(Pneumonia)-CAUSES->(Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia)\n(Levofloxacin)-TREATS->(Latent Infection)-CAUSES->(Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia)\n(Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia)-CAUSES->(Adverse reaction to drug)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Genes)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole Combination)\n(Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia)-CAUSES->(Adverse reaction to drug)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Alleles)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole Combination)\n(Kanamycin)-ISA->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Aminoglycosides)\n(Kanamycin)-TREATS->(Bacteria)-LOCATION_OF->(Aminoglycosides)\n(Aminoglycosides)-TREATS->(Enterococcus faecalis)-LOCATION_OF->(Kanamycin)\n(Aminoglycosides)-TREATS->(Pseudomonas aeruginosa)-LOCATION_OF->(Kanamycin)\n(Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia)-PROCESS_OF->(Pseudomonas aeruginosa)-LOCATION_OF->(Kanamycin)\n(Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia)-PROCESS_OF->(Bacterial cell)-LOCATION_OF->(Kanamycin)\n(Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia)-CAUSES->(Adverse reaction to drug)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Genes)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole Combination)\n(Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia)-CAUSES->(Adverse reaction to drug)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Alleles)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole Combination)\n(Levofloxacin)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(BMP1|PRCP|PGPEP1)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole Combination)\n(Levofloxacin)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole Combination)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Cotrimoxazole is the recommended treatment for pneumonia caused by P. carinii, now known as Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia. This consensus is supported by the fact that Cotrimoxazole, a combination of trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole, is specifically effective against this type of fungal-like organism. The evidence paths confirm the interaction of Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, reinforcing its role as the drug of choice. Other options such as Penicillin, Kanamycin, and Levofloxacin are less suitable. Penicillin is ineffective as P. carinii is not a typical bacterium. Kanamycin, an aminoglycoside, is not effective against Pneumocystis pneumonia. Levofloxacin, although a broad-spectrum antibiotic, is not the first-line treatment for this condition and is less effective than Cotrimoxazole.\"\n}",
