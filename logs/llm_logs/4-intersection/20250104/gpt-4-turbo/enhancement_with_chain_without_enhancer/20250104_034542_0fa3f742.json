  "response": "### Enhanced Information Summary\n\nIsoniazid (INH), a medication used primarily for treating tuberculosis, is known to cause neuropathy as a side effect by interfering with the metabolism of pyridoxine (vitamin B6). This interference leads to a deficiency in pyridoxine, which is crucial for nerve health and function. The depletion of pyridoxine results in nerve damage, manifesting as peripheral neuropathy.\n\nThe treatment for INH-induced neuropathy is well-established in medical practice and supported by biochemical consensus: supplementation with pyridoxine. Pyridoxine supplementation replenishes vitamin B6 levels, thereby restoring normal nerve function and alleviating the symptoms of neuropathy. This approach is directly supported by the evidence paths indicating that pyridoxine treats neuropathy and is associated with the pathogenesis of diseases treated by isoniazid.\n\nOther vitamins such as thiamine, niacin, and riboflavin were considered in the reasoning chains. However, there is no strong consensus or specific evidence supporting their use in treating INH-induced neuropathy. The evidence paths related to these vitamins either do not directly address their role in INH-induced neuropathy or are too broad and unrelated to the specific mechanism by which INH causes neuropathy.\n\nTherefore, the best consensus-supported treatment for INH-induced neuropathy is pyridoxine supplementation, which effectively counteracts the effects of INH on vitamin B6 metabolism and improves nerve health.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"The treatment for INH-induced neuropathy is pyridoxine supplementation.
