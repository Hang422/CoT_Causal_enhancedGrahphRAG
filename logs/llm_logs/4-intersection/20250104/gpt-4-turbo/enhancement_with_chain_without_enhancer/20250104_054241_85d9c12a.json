  "response": "### Enhanced Information Summary\n\nEpinephrine, when administered in high doses intravenously, has several physiological effects due to its interaction with adrenergic receptors. Here's a breakdown of the actions related to the options provided:\n\n1. **Increases liver glycogenolysis**: Epinephrine activates beta-2 adrenergic receptors, which increases cyclic AMP in liver cells. This activation leads to the stimulation of glycogen phosphorylase, thereby increasing liver glycogenolysis. This chain is supported by the evidence path showing interactions between cyclic AMP, glycogen phosphorylase, and liver cells, confirming the biochemical pathway involved.\n\n2. **Causes bronchiolar constriction**: This is incorrect as epinephrine typically activates beta-2 adrenergic receptors leading to bronchiolar relaxation, not constriction. The evidence paths related to beta-2 adrenergic receptors interacting with muscle cells and leading to relaxation support this consensus, confirming that bronchiolar constriction is not a typical action of epinephrine.\n\n3. **Evokes extrasystoles in the heart**: High doses of epinephrine stimulate beta-1 adrenergic receptors in the heart, which can increase the heart rate and force of contraction. This can potentially lead to extrasystoles, a type of premature cardiac complex. The evidence paths linking force and contraction to premature cardiac complexes align with this understanding, supporting the chain's accuracy.\n\n4. **Produces restlessness and anxiety**: Epinephrine can stimulate the central nervous system, which may lead to feelings of anxiety and subsequent restlessness. The evidence paths linking anxiety to agitation provide additional support for this action of epinephrine on the central nervous system.\n\nIn conclusion, the action of epinephrine that is not correct when administered intravenously in a high dose is causing bronchiolar constriction. Instead, epinephrine causes bronchiolar relaxation, which is the opposite of the stated option.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Epinephrine, when administered in high doses intravenously, increases liver glycogenolysis, evokes extrasystoles in the heart, and produces restlessness and anxiety, all supported by biochemical pathways and receptor interactions. However, it does not cause bronchiolar constriction; it causes bronchiolar relaxation, contrary to one of the options provided.\"\n}\n```",
