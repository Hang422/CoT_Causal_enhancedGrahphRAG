      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Antidepressant drug that can be used in nocturnal enuresis is?\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Imipramine\nopb. Fluvoxamine\nopc. Phenelzine\nopd. Bupropion\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Imipramine\" -> \"tricyclic antidepressant\" -> \"anticholinergic effects\" -> \"increases bladder capacity\" -> \"reduces bedwetting\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Fluvoxamine\" -> \"SSRI antidepressant\" -> \"no significant anticholinergic effects\" -> \"not effective for nocturnal enuresis\" -> 10%\nCHAIN: \"Phenelzine\" -> \"MAOI antidepressant\" -> \"no significant anticholinergic effects\" -> \"not effective for nocturnal enuresis\" -> 10%\nCHAIN: \"Bupropion\" -> \"NDRI antidepressant\" -> \"no significant anticholinergic effects\" -> \"not effective for nocturnal enuresis\" -> 10%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Imipramine)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Antidepressive Agents)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Antidepressive Agents, Tricyclic)\n(Imipramine)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Antipsychotic Agents)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Antidepressive Agents, Tricyclic)\n(Bladder)-LOCATION_OF->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-CAUSES->(Bedwetting)\n(Bladder)-LOCATION_OF->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-TREATS->(Bedwetting)\n(Fluvoxamine)-ISA->(Antidepressive Agents)\n(Phenelzine)-TREATS->(Infertility)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Genes)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Antidepressive Agents)\n(Phenelzine)-TREATS->(Ischemia)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Genes)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Antidepressive Agents)\n(Bupropion)-ISA->(Antidepressive Agents)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Imipramine, a tricyclic antidepressant, is known to have anticholinergic effects which can increase bladder capacity and reduce bedwetting, making it effective for the treatment of nocturnal enuresis. This aligns with the evidence path linking Imipramine to tricyclic antidepressants and their interaction with antipsychotic agents, indirectly supporting its use in increasing bladder capacity. Other antidepressants such as Fluvoxamine (an SSRI), Phenelzine (an MAOI), and Bupropion (an NDRI) lack significant anticholinergic effects and are not effective for treating nocturnal enuresis, as their primary mechanisms do not involve modulation of bladder capacity.\"\n}",
