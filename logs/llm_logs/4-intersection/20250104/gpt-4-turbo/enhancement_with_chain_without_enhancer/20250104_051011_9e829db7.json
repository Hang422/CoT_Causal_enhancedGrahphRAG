  "response": "### Enhanced Information Summary\n\nIn the context of severe renal failure, it is crucial to select antitubercular drugs that are either minimally metabolized by the kidneys or can be safely adjusted in dosage to avoid toxicity. Here's a breakdown of the options based on medical consensus and pharmacological properties:\n\n1. **Rifampicin**: This drug is primarily metabolized by the liver, with minimal renal excretion. The reasoning chain correctly identifies that Rifampicin is safe for use in patients with severe renal failure due to its liver-based metabolism. This is supported by standard pharmacological knowledge, which aligns with the evidence paths indicating liver involvement in drug metabolism processes.\n\n2. **Ethambutol**: While Ethambutol is used in the treatment of tuberculosis, it requires careful monitoring and dose adjustment in patients with renal failure due to its potential for causing dose-related toxicity. The reasoning chain and evidence paths suggest that Ethambutol can be used, but with significant caution and adjustments, reflecting a nuanced approach in clinical practice.\n\n3. **Streptomycin and Capreomycin**: Both drugs are primarily excreted by the kidneys, which poses a high risk in patients with severe renal failure. The reasoning chains correctly highlight the risks associated with these drugs in the context of reduced kidney function. The evidence paths, while broad, do not contradict this consensus, emphasizing the need to avoid these medications in severe renal failure due to their renal clearance mechanisms.\n\nIn conclusion, **Rifampicin** is the safest option among the listed antitubercular drugs for use in patients with severe renal failure due to its liver-based metabolism. Ethambutol might be considered but requires stringent monitoring and dose adjustments. Streptomycin and Capreomycin should be avoided due to their high renal clearance and the associated risk of toxicity in renal failure.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Rifampicin is the safest antitubercular drug for use in severe renal failure due to its primary metabolism by the liver, posing minimal risk of toxicity.
