      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Physiology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Enzymatic markers of plasma membrane include all except\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. 5'-nucleotidase\nopb. Adenylyl cyclase\nopc. Na+-K+-ATPase\nopd. Galactosyl transferase\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"5'-nucleotidase\" -> \"marker of plasma membrane\" -> \"included in options\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Adenylyl cyclase\" -> \"marker of plasma membrane\" -> \"included in options\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Na+-K+-ATPase\" -> \"marker of plasma membrane\" -> \"included in options\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Galactosyl transferase\" -> \"marker of Golgi apparatus\" -> \"not a plasma membrane marker\" -> \"excluded from options\" -> 90%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(5'-NUCLEOTIDASE)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cells)-LOCATION_OF->(Genes)-PART_OF->(Cell membrane)\n(5'-NUCLEOTIDASE)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Muscle Fibers)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Genes)-PART_OF->(Cell membrane)\n(Adenylate Cyclase)-INTERACTS_WITH->(CAMP)-PART_OF->(Cell membrane)\n(Adenylate Cyclase)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Phosphatidic Acid)-PART_OF->(Cell membrane)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Among the options provided, 5'-nucleotidase, adenylyl cyclase, and Na+-K+-ATPase are all recognized as markers of the plasma membrane. 5'-nucleotidase is known for its role in the outer cell membrane where it hydrolyzes extracellular nucleotides. Adenylyl cyclase, involved in the generation of cAMP, is an integral membrane enzyme found in the plasma membrane. Na+-K+-ATPase, crucial for maintaining cellular ion gradients, is also a well-established component of the plasma membrane. In contrast, galactosyl transferase is primarily associated with the Golgi apparatus, not the plasma membrane, making it the correct answer as the enzyme not marking the plasma membrane. The evidence paths provided confirm the membrane associations for 5'-nucleotidase and adenylyl cyclase but do not directly address their specific cellular locations, thus their general relevance to cell membranes supports the consensus but is not decisive for this specific question.\"\n}",
