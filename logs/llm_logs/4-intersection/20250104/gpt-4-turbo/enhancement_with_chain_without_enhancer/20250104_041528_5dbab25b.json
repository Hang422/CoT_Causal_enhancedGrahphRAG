      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Drug used in triple drug therapy of H. Pylori:\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Metronidazole\nopb. Erythromycin\nopc. Ciprofloxacin\nopd. Aminoglycosides\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Metronidazole\" -> \"commonly used in H. Pylori treatment\" -> \"part of recommended triple therapy\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Erythromycin\" -> \"used for bacterial infections\" -> \"not standard for H. Pylori triple therapy\" -> 10%\nCHAIN: \"Ciprofloxacin\" -> \"treats bacterial infections\" -> \"not typically used in H. Pylori triple therapy\" -> 10%\nCHAIN: \"Aminoglycosides\" -> \"used for severe bacterial infections\" -> \"not used in H. Pylori treatment\" -> 5%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Metronidazole)-TREATS->(Helicobacter pylori)\n(Ciprofloxacin)-TREATS->(Bacterial Infections)\n(Aminoglycosides)-PREVENTS->(Bacterial Infections)\n(Bacterial Infections)-PROCESS_OF->(Helicobacter pylori)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Metronidazole is a standard component of the recommended triple therapy for H. pylori infection, which typically includes a proton pump inhibitor, clarithromycin, and either amoxicillin or metronidazole. This is supported by the evidence path directly linking Metronidazole to the treatment of Helicobacter pylori. Erythromycin, while a treatment for bacterial infections, is not standard for H. pylori triple therapy. Ciprofloxacin, although effective against bacterial infections, is not typically used in H. pylori triple therapy. Aminoglycosides are used for severe bacterial infections but are not used in the treatment of H. pylori. Therefore, the most accurate option supported by medical consensus and evidence paths is Metronidazole.\"\n}",
