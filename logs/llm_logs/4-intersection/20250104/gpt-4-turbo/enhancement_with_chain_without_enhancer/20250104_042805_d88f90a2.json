      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Drug of choice for relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis is:\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Alpha IEN\nopb. Beta IFN\nopc. Gamma IFN\nopd. Natalizumab\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Beta IFN\" -> \"modulates immune response\" -> \"reduces frequency of relapses in RRMS\" -> \"approved as first-line treatment for RRMS\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Natalizumab\" -> \"blocks immune cell migration to CNS\" -> \"reduces inflammation and relapse rates in RRMS\" -> \"used for patients with inadequate response to first-line treatments\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Alpha IEN\" -> \"antiviral and antiproliferative properties\" -> \"not primarily used for RRMS\" -> \"less effective in reducing relapse rates compared to Beta IFN\" -> 40%\nCHAIN: \"Gamma IFN\" -> \"increases immune response\" -> \"potentially exacerbates autoimmune diseases\" -> \"not recommended for RRMS treatment\" -> 30%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Recombinant Interleukin-6)-CAUSES->(Hyperesthesia)-PREDISPOSES->(Disease)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Immunity)\n(Recombinant Interleukin-6)-TREATS->(Liver Failure)-CAUSES->(Disease)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Immunity)\n(Recombinant Interleukin-6)-TREATS->(Baculovirus)-CAUSES->(Disease)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Immunity)\n(Obstruction)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Inflammation)\n(Immunity)-PROCESS_OF->(HIV)-CAUSES->(Autoimmune Diseases)\n(Relapse)-CAUSES->(Adhesions)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Genes)-PART_OF->(Mucous Membrane)-LOCATION_OF->(First line treatment)\n(Relapse)-CAUSES->(Adhesions)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Genes)-PART_OF->(Skeletal muscle structure)-LOCATION_OF->(First line treatment)\n(natalizumab)-INTERACTS_WITH->(T-Lymphocyte)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Immune Cell)\n(natalizumab)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cells)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Immune Cell)\n(Immune Cell)-LOCATION_OF->(Virus)-CAUSES->(Inflammation)\n(Immune Cell)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Genes)-CAUSES->(Inflammation)\n(Inflammation)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Genes)-PART_OF->(Mucous Membrane)-LOCATION_OF->(First line treatment)\n(Inflammation)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Genes)-PART_OF->(Skeletal muscle structure)-LOCATION_OF->(First line treatment)\n(Relapse)-CAUSES->(Adhesions)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Genes)-PART_OF->(Mucous Membrane)-LOCATION_OF->(First line treatment)\n(Relapse)-CAUSES->(Adhesions)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Genes)-PART_OF->(Skeletal muscle structure)-LOCATION_OF->(First line treatment)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Beta IFN is the drug of choice for relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) as it modulates the immune response and is approved as a first-line treatment due to its efficacy in reducing the frequency of relapses. Natalizumab, although effective in reducing inflammation and relapse rates by blocking immune cell migration to the CNS, is generally reserved for patients with inadequate response to first-line treatments like Beta IFN. Alpha IEN, with its antiviral and antiproliferative properties, is not primarily used for RRMS and is less effective in reducing relapse rates compared to Beta IFN. Gamma IFN is not recommended for RRMS treatment as it can potentially exacerbate autoimmune diseases by increasing the immune response.\"\n}",
