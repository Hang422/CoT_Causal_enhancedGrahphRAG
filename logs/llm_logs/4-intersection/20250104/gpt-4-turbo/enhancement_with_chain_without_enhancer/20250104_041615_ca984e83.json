      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Levamisole is used as all except -\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Single dose in ascariasis\nopb. Immunostimulant\nopc. Paralysis of worms by depolarisation\nopd. Immunodepressant in high doses\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Levamisole\" -> \"used as an anthelmintic\" -> \"effective in single doses for ascariasis\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Levamisole\" -> \"acts as an immunomodulator\" -> \"functions as an immunostimulant\" -> 98%\nCHAIN: \"Levamisole\" -> \"causes hyperpolarization of worm muscle membrane\" -> \"leads to paralysis of worms\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Levamisole\" -> \"used in low doses primarily\" -> \"immunodepressant effects at high doses unclear\" -> 70%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Anthelmintics)-PREVENTS->(Ascariasis)\n(Levamisole)-TREATS->(Virus)-LOCATION_OF->(Lipids)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Anthelmintics)\n(Levamisole)-TREATS->(Virus)-LOCATION_OF->(Sugars)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Anthelmintics)\n(Levamisole)-TREATS->(Disease)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Immunity)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Immunologic Adjuvants)\n(Levamisole)-TREATS->(Disease)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Antiinflammatory Effect)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Immunologic Adjuvants)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "### Enhanced Information Analysis:\n\n1. **Option A: Single dose in ascariasis**\n   - **Chain Analysis**: Levamisole is indeed used as an anthelmintic and is effective in single doses for treating ascariasis. This is a standard treatment protocol.\n   - **Evidence Path Relevance**: The path (Anthelmintics)-PREVENTS->(Ascariasis) supports this usage directly and aligns with medical consensus.\n\n2. **Option B: Immunostimulant**\n   - **Chain Analysis**: Levamisole acts as an immunomodulator and functions as an immunostimulant. This is well-documented in medical literature.\n   - **Evidence Path Relevance**: The path (Levamisole)-TREATS->(Disease)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Immunity)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Immunologic Adjuvants) supports its role in immune modulation.\n\n3. **Option C: Paralysis of worms by depolarization**\n   - **Chain Analysis**: The chain incorrectly states that Levamisole causes hyperpolarization, whereas it actually causes depolarization of the worm muscle membrane, leading to paralysis. This step needs correction to reflect that Levamisole causes depolarization.\n   - **Evidence Path Relevance**: No direct path supports the specific action on worm muscle membranes, but the general anthelmintic action is known.\n\n4. **Option D: Immunodepressant in high doses**\n   - **Chain Analysis**: The chain suggests uncertainty about Levamisole's immunodepressant effects at high doses. Current medical consensus does not support Levamisole as having immunodepressant effects; rather, it can lead to an overstimulation of the immune system, which might be misinterpreted as immunodepression.\n   - **Evidence Path Relevance**: The paths provided do not offer clarity on this specific aspect, focusing instead on its immunostimulant properties.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBased on the corrected chains and the relevance of the evidence paths, the best consensus-supported interpretation is that Levamisole is not used as an immunodepressant in high doses. This option contradicts the known pharmacological effects of Levamisole, which primarily include anthelmintic and immunostimulant properties, without documented immunodepressant effects at high doses.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Levamisole is correctly used as an anthelmintic effective in single doses for ascariasis, and as an immunostimulant. It causes paralysis of worms by depolarization, not hyperpolarization. There is no consensus supporting its use as an immunodepressant at high doses; this is a misunderstanding of its potential overstimulation effects on the immune system.\"\n}\n```",
