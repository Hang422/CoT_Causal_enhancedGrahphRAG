      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Physiology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        True regarding respiratory centre\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Directly simulated by fall in PaO2\nopb. Connected with cardiac center\nopc. Inhibited during swallowing\nopd. Situated in midbrain\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Respiratory centre\" -> \"located in the medulla oblongata and pons\" -> \"not situated in midbrain\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Respiratory centre\" -> \"receives signals from chemoreceptors\" -> \"chemoreceptors respond to CO2 levels primarily\" -> \"PaO2 has less direct effect\" -> \"not directly stimulated by fall in PaO2\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Respiratory centre\" -> \"closely linked to autonomic nervous system\" -> \"autonomic nervous system controls both respiratory and cardiac functions\" -> \"connected with cardiac center\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Swallowing\" -> \"activates swallowing center in the medulla\" -> \"temporarily inhibits respiratory center to prevent aspiration\" -> \"inhibited during swallowing\" -> 95%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Medulla Oblongata)-PART_OF->(Midbrain structure)\n(Pontine structure)-PART_OF->(Midbrain structure)\n(Chemoreceptors)-PART_OF->(Muscle)-LOCATION_OF->(PO2 measurement)\n(Chemoreceptors)-PART_OF->(Mucous Membrane)-LOCATION_OF->(PO2 measurement)\n(Medulla Oblongata)-LOCATION_OF->(Genes)-PART_OF->(Organoids)-LOCATION_OF->(Aspiration-action)\n(Medulla Oblongata)-LOCATION_OF->(Genes)-PART_OF->(Tissue specimen)-LOCATION_OF->(Aspiration-action)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"The respiratory centre is primarily located in the medulla oblongata and pons, not in the midbrain, aligning with the consensus that it is not situated in the midbrain. It is not directly stimulated by a fall in PaO2, as it primarily responds to changes in CO2 levels, with PaO2 having a less direct effect. The respiratory centre is connected with the cardiac center through the autonomic nervous system, which controls both respiratory and cardiac functions. During swallowing, the respiratory centre is temporarily inhibited by the swallowing center in the medulla to prevent aspiration, confirming its inhibition during this process.\"\n}",
