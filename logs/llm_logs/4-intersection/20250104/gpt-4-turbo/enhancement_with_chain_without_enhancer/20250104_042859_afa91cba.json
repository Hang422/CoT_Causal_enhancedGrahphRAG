  "response": "### Enhanced Information Summary\n\nAldosterone is a hormone that plays a crucial role in regulating sodium and water balance in the body, primarily through its action on the kidneys. The primary site of aldosterone's action is the collecting duct of the nephron. Here, aldosterone binds to mineralocorticoid receptors, which leads to an increase in sodium reabsorption and potassium excretion. This process is critical for maintaining blood pressure and electrolyte balance.\n\nThe evidence path confirming aldosterone's interaction with mineralocorticoid receptors supports this understanding, as it directly aligns with the physiological action of aldosterone in the collecting duct. The other retrieved evidence paths, although correct, focus broadly on kidney functions and do not specifically address aldosterone's targeted action within the nephron segments.\n\nThe reasoning chains for the other options (glomerulus, proximal convoluted tubule, and loop of Henle) correctly identify that aldosterone does not primarily act in these areas. The effects of aldosterone in these segments are either minimal or not significant, which is consistent with medical consensus.\n\nIn summary, aldosterone's primary action is in the collecting duct of the kidney, where it binds to mineralocorticoid receptors to increase sodium reabsorption, a key mechanism in regulating electrolyte balance and blood pressure. The evidence of aldosterone interacting with mineralocorticoid receptors reinforces this point, making it the most accurate and supported answer.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Aldosterone primarily acts in the collecting duct of the kidney, where it binds to mineralocorticoid receptors to increase sodium reabsorption and potassium excretion, crucial for maintaining blood pressure and electrolyte balance.
