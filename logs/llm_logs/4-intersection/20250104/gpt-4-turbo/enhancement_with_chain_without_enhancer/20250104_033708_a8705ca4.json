  "response": "### Enhanced Information Summary\n\nCholecystokinin (CCK) is a hormone that plays a significant role in the digestive system. It is primarily known for its effects on the gallbladder and pancreas.\n\n1. **Contraction of the Gallbladder**: CCK is well-documented to stimulate the gallbladder, causing it to contract. This action facilitates the release of stored bile into the small intestine, aiding in digestion, particularly of fats. The evidence paths indicating that CCK causes fluid secretion and uptake in the gallbladder support this function.\n\n2. **Secretion of Pancreatic Juice Rich in Enzymes**: CCK also acts on the pancreas, promoting the secretion of pancreatic juice that is rich in digestive enzymes. This is crucial for the breakdown of various nutrients in the food we consume. The evidence paths showing fluid secretion and enzyme interactions in the pancreas align with this role.\n\n3. **Increases the Secretion of Enterokinase**: The role of CCK in directly increasing the secretion of enterokinase from the small intestine is less clear and not as strongly supported by standard medical consensus as the other functions. Enterokinase (or enteropeptidase) is important for activating other digestive enzymes, but its secretion is generally considered to be influenced more by other factors within the intestinal environment rather than directly by CCK.\n\n4. **Option Evaluation**: Given the strong evidence and consensus on the roles of CCK in stimulating the gallbladder and pancreas, options (a) and (b) are correct. However, the claim in option (c) about increasing the secretion of enterokinase is not strongly supported and is less directly related to CCK's primary known actions. Therefore, option (d) \"All\" is not entirely correct as it includes the less supported claim of option (c).\n\nIn conclusion, the actions of cholecystokinin include the contraction of the gallbladder and the secretion of pancreatic juice rich in enzymes. The evidence does not robustly support an increase in the secretion of enterokinase directly by CCK.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Cholecystokinin (CCK) is known to cause contraction of the gallbladder and stimulate the secretion of pancreatic juice rich in enzymes. These actions are supported by evidence paths indicating fluid secretion and enzyme interactions in both the gallbladder and pancreas. However, the role of CCK in directly increasing the secretion of enterokinase in the small intestine is not strongly supported by medical consensus, making options (a) and (b) correct, but not option (c). Therefore, option (d) 'All' is also not correct.\"\n}\n```",
