      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Physiology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Progesterone production in the ovary is primarily by:\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Stroma\nopb. Corpora albicans\nopc. Corpora lutea\nopd. Mature follicles\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Ovary\" -> \"Ovulation\" -> \"Formation of corpus luteum\" -> \"Progesterone production\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Mature follicles\" -> \"Ovulation\" -> \"Transformation into corpus luteum\" -> \"Progesterone production\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Corpora lutea\" -> \"Luteal cells\" -> \"Progesterone synthesis\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Stroma\" -> \"Supportive tissue\" -> \"Possible involvement in hormone regulation\" -> \"Unlikely primary source of progesterone\" -> 30%\nCHAIN: \"Corpora albicans\" -> \"Degenerated corpus luteum\" -> \"Minimal hormone production\" -> \"Unlikely primary source of progesterone\" -> 20%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Structure of corpus luteum of ovary)-LOCATION_OF->(Progesterone)\n(Structure of corpus luteum of ovary)-LOCATION_OF->(Oxytocin)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Luteal Cells)\n(Luteal Cells)-LOCATION_OF->(Progesterone)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Progesterone production in the ovary is primarily by the corpora lutea. The corpus luteum forms after ovulation from the remnants of the mature follicle and is the main site of progesterone synthesis. This is supported by the evidence path indicating that luteal cells within the corpus luteum are responsible for progesterone production. The stroma and corpora albicans are not primary sources of progesterone; the stroma is mainly supportive tissue, and the corpora albicans is a degenerated form of the corpus luteum with minimal hormone production. Therefore, the corpora lutea is the correct answer.\"\n}\n```",
