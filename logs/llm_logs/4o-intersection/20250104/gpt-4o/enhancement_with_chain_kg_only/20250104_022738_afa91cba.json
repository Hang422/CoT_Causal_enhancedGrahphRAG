      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Physiology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Aldosterone acts at:\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Collecting duct\nopb. Glomerulus\nopc. Proximal convoluted tubule\nopd. Loop of Henle\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Aldosterone\" -> \"acts on distal nephron\" -> \"specifically collecting duct\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Aldosterone\" -> \"sodium reabsorption\" -> \"water retention\" -> \"collecting duct involvement\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Aldosterone\" -> \"increased sodium channels\" -> \"collecting duct\" -> \"enhanced sodium reabsorption\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Aldosterone\" -> \"potassium excretion\" -> \"collecting duct\" -> \"electrolyte balance\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Aldosterone\" -> \"acts on nephron\" -> \"not glomerulus\" -> \"not proximal convoluted tubule\" -> \"not loop of Henle\" -> \"collecting duct\" -> 80%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Aldosterone)-PART_OF->(Nephrons)\n(Aldosterone)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Sodium Channel)\n(Sodium Channel)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cells)-PART_OF->(Breast collecting duct)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Aldosterone primarily acts on the distal nephron, specifically the collecting duct, where it promotes sodium reabsorption and potassium excretion. This action is facilitated by the increased expression of sodium channels in the cells of the collecting duct, leading to enhanced sodium reabsorption and water retention, which contributes to electrolyte balance. The retrieved evidence paths support this by indicating aldosterone's interaction with sodium channels, which are part of the cellular mechanisms in the collecting duct. The consensus in physiology confirms that aldosterone does not act on the glomerulus, proximal convoluted tubule, or loop of Henle, but rather on the collecting duct, aligning with the corrected reasoning chains.\"\n}\n```",
