      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        A person on anti-tubercular drugs complained of deafness and tinnitus in one ear. Drug implicated is?\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Streptomycin\nopb. Isoniazid\nopc. Ethambutol\nopd. Rifampicin\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Streptomycin\" -> \"ototoxicity\" -> \"deafness\" -> \"tinnitus\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Isoniazid\" -> \"peripheral neuropathy\" -> \"unclear link to deafness\" -> 40%\nCHAIN: \"Ethambutol\" -> \"optic neuritis\" -> \"visual disturbances\" -> \"no direct link to deafness\" -> 30%\nCHAIN: \"Rifampicin\" -> \"hepatotoxicity\" -> \"no direct link to deafness\" -> 20%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(isoniazid)-TREATS->(Peripheral Neuropathy)\n(Ethambutol)-TREATS->(Optic Neuritis)\n(Streptomycin)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Disease)-CAUSES->(Ototoxicity)\n(Streptomycin)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Tuberculosis, Multidrug-Resistant)-CAUSES->(Ototoxicity)\n(Deafness)-COMPLICATES/PREDISPOSES->(Disease)-CAUSES->(Tinnitus)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Streptomycin is the most likely anti-tubercular drug implicated in causing deafness and tinnitus. This is supported by the consensus that streptomycin is known to cause ototoxicity, which can lead to symptoms such as deafness and tinnitus. The evidence paths confirm this association, showing that streptomycin is linked to ototoxicity, a known cause of these auditory symptoms. In contrast, isoniazid is primarily associated with peripheral neuropathy, ethambutol with optic neuritis, and rifampicin with hepatotoxicity, none of which directly cause deafness or tinnitus. Therefore, based on the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence, streptomycin is the drug most likely responsible for the patient's symptoms.\"\n}\n```",
