      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Folic acid metabolism is inhibited by :  a) Sulfonamides b) Methotrexate c) Nitrous oxide d) Trimethoprim e) 5–Flucytosine\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. acd\nopb. abd\nopc. bde\nopd. ace\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Sulfonamides\" -> \"inhibit dihydropteroate synthase\" -> \"decreased folate synthesis\" -> \"inhibited folic acid metabolism\" -> 80%\nCHAIN: \"Methotrexate\" -> \"inhibits dihydrofolate reductase\" -> \"decreased tetrahydrofolate\" -> \"inhibited folic acid metabolism\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Nitrous oxide\" -> \"oxidizes vitamin B12\" -> \"impaired methionine synthase\" -> \"inhibited folic acid metabolism\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Trimethoprim\" -> \"inhibits dihydrofolate reductase\" -> \"decreased tetrahydrofolate\" -> \"inhibited folic acid metabolism\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"5-Flucytosine\" -> \"converted to 5-fluorouracil\" -> \"inhibits thymidylate synthase\" -> \"possible folate pathway interference\" -> 70%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Nitrous Oxide)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(APP gene)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Vitamin B 12)\n(Nitrous Oxide)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Alleles)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Vitamin B 12)\n(Methotrexate)-TREATS->(Hypertension, Pulmonary)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Dihydrofolate Reductase)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3.

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Folic acid metabolism can be inhibited by several mechanisms. Methotrexate is well-known to inhibit dihydrofolate reductase, leading to decreased tetrahydrofolate and thus inhibiting folic acid metabolism, which is strongly supported by consensus and evidence. Trimethoprim also inhibits dihydrofolate reductase, similarly affecting folic acid metabolism. Sulfonamides inhibit dihydropteroate synthase, which decreases folate synthesis, indirectly affecting folic acid metabolism. Nitrous oxide oxidizes vitamin B12, impairing methionine synthase, which can indirectly affect folate metabolism, though this is less direct. 5-Flucytosine is converted to 5-fluorouracil, which inhibits thymidylate synthase, potentially interfering with folate pathways, but this is not a primary mechanism for inhibiting folic acid metabolism. Therefore, the most consensus-supported inhibitors of folic acid metabolism are Methotrexate, Trimethoprim, and Sulfonamides, aligning with option 'opb. abd'.\"\n}\n```",
