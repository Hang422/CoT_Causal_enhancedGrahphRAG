      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Biochemistry.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        During labor and delivery, a specific hormone causes uterine contractions. This hormone is produced in which one of the following anatomical locations?\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Hypothalamus\nopb. Anterior pituitary\nopc. Posterior pituitary\nopd. Adrenal cortex\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Oxytocin\" -> \"produced in hypothalamus\" -> \"transported to posterior pituitary\" -> \"released into bloodstream\" -> \"causes uterine contractions\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Oxytocin\" -> \"produced in hypothalamus\" -> \"stored in posterior pituitary\" -> \"released during labor\" -> \"induces uterine contractions\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Oxytocin\" -> \"synthesized in hypothalamus\" -> \"moved to posterior pituitary\" -> \"released into circulation\" -> \"stimulates uterine contractions\" -> 92%\nCHAIN: \"Oxytocin\" -> \"originates in hypothalamus\" -> \"stored and released by posterior pituitary\" -> \"triggers uterine contractions\" -> 93%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Oxytocin)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cells)-PART_OF->(Hypothalamic structure)\n(Oxytocin)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Motor Neurons)-PART_OF->(Hypothalamic structure)\n(Hypothalamic structure)-PART_OF->(Pituitary Gland, Posterior)\n(Pituitary Gland, Posterior)-PART_OF->(Trigeminal nerve structure)-PART_OF->(Nerve)-LOCATION_OF->(Release procedure)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Oxytocin is a hormone responsible for causing uterine contractions during labor. It is synthesized in the hypothalamus and then transported to the posterior pituitary, where it is stored. During labor, oxytocin is released from the posterior pituitary into the bloodstream, where it acts to induce uterine contractions. This process is well-supported by the consensus that the hypothalamus is the site of oxytocin production, while the posterior pituitary is responsible for its storage and release. The retrieved evidence paths confirm the involvement of the hypothalamic structure in the production of oxytocin and its relationship with the posterior pituitary, aligning with the consensus that the hypothalamus is the anatomical location where oxytocin is produced.\"\n}\n```",
