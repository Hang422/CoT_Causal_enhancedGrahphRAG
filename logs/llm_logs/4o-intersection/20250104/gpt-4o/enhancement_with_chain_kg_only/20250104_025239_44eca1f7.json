      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Alpha la adrenergic blocker giving symptomatic relief in BPH?\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Tamsulosin\nopb. Prazosin\nopc. Oxazocin\nopd. Dolazoline\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Tamsulosin\" -> \"alpha-1 adrenergic blocker\" -> \"relaxation of smooth muscle in prostate\" -> \"improved urine flow\" -> \"symptomatic relief in BPH\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Prazosin\" -> \"alpha-1 adrenergic blocker\" -> \"relaxation of smooth muscle in prostate\" -> \"improved urine flow\" -> \"symptomatic relief in BPH\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Oxazocin\" -> \"alpha-1 adrenergic blocker\" -> \"relaxation of smooth muscle in prostate\" -> \"improved urine flow\" -> \"symptomatic relief in BPH\" -> 70%\nCHAIN: \"Dolazoline\" -> \"unclear mechanism in BPH\" -> \"possible alpha-adrenergic effects\" -> \"uncertain symptomatic relief in BPH\" -> 50%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Flow of urine)-PROCESS_OF->(Rectum)-LOCATION_OF->(Symptoms)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Tamsulosin and Prazosin are both alpha-1 adrenergic blockers that provide symptomatic relief in benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) by relaxing smooth muscle in the prostate, thereby improving urine flow. Tamsulosin is particularly well-known and widely used for this purpose, with a high efficacy rate. Oxazocin, while also an alpha-1 adrenergic blocker, is less commonly used and has a lower efficacy rate for BPH symptom relief. Dolazoline does not have a clear mechanism or established efficacy in treating BPH symptoms, making it an unsuitable choice. The evidence path regarding urine flow and BPH symptoms supports the mechanism of action for alpha-1 blockers like Tamsulosin and Prazosin, confirming their role in improving urinary symptoms associated with BPH.\"\n}\n```",
