      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Which of the following diuretics is contraindicated in the presence of cardiac failure?\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Mannitol\nopb. Spironolactone\nopc. Furosemide\nopd. Hydrochlorothiazide\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Mannitol\" -> \"osmotic diuretic\" -> \"increases plasma volume\" -> \"worsens cardiac failure\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Spironolactone\" -> \"potassium-sparing diuretic\" -> \"reduces fluid overload\" -> \"beneficial in cardiac failure\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Furosemide\" -> \"loop diuretic\" -> \"reduces fluid overload\" -> \"beneficial in cardiac failure\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Hydrochlorothiazide\" -> \"thiazide diuretic\" -> \"reduces fluid overload\" -> \"beneficial in mild cardiac failure\" -> 80%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Thiazide Diuretics)-TREATS->(Hypernatremia)\n(Mannitol)-INTERACTS_WITH/ISA->(Diuretics, Osmotic)\n(Spironolactone)-ISA->(Potassium Sparing Diuretics)\n(Hydrochlorothiazide)-ISA->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Thiazide Diuretics)\n(Hydrochlorothiazide)-CAUSES->(Excretory function)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Thiazide Diuretics)\n(Potassium Sparing Diuretics)-TREATS->(Disease)-CAUSES/MANIFESTATION_OF->(Hypernatremia)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Mannitol is an osmotic diuretic that increases plasma volume, which can exacerbate cardiac failure by increasing the workload on the heart. Therefore, it is contraindicated in cardiac failure. Spironolactone is a potassium-sparing diuretic that helps reduce fluid overload and is beneficial in managing cardiac failure. Furosemide, a loop diuretic, effectively reduces fluid overload and is commonly used in treating cardiac failure. Hydrochlorothiazide, a thiazide diuretic, also reduces fluid overload and can be beneficial in mild cardiac failure. The evidence paths confirm the classification and general effects of these diuretics but do not directly address contraindications in cardiac failure. Based on consensus, Mannitol is the diuretic contraindicated in the presence of cardiac failure.\"\n}\n```",
