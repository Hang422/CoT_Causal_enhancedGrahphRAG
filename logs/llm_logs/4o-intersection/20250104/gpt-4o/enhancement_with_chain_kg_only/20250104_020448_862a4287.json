      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Schizophrenia is treated by:\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Anti depressants\nopb. Anti psychotics\nopc. Anti epileptics\nopd. Mood stabilizers\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Schizophrenia\" -> \"dopamine dysregulation\" -> \"need to block dopamine receptors\" -> \"use of antipsychotics\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Schizophrenia\" -> \"positive symptoms\" -> \"hallucinations and delusions\" -> \"antipsychotics reduce symptoms\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Schizophrenia\" -> \"negative symptoms\" -> \"social withdrawal and apathy\" -> \"antipsychotics may help\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Schizophrenia\" -> \"cognitive symptoms\" -> \"impaired attention and memory\" -> \"antipsychotics may improve\" -> 80%\nCHAIN: \"Schizophrenia\" -> \"antipsychotics\" -> \"dopamine receptor antagonism\" -> \"symptom control\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Schizophrenia\" -> \"antidepressants\" -> \"possible use for comorbid depression\" -> \"not primary treatment\" -> 60%\nCHAIN: \"Schizophrenia\" -> \"antiepileptics\" -> \"not standard treatment\" -> \"possible use for mood stabilization\" -> 50%\nCHAIN: \"Schizophrenia\" -> \"mood stabilizers\" -> \"not primary treatment\" -> \"possible use for mood symptoms\" -> 55%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Schizophrenia)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(physiological aspects)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Antipsychotic Agents)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Mood Stabilizers)\n(Schizophrenia)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(physiological aspects)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Antipsychotic Agents)\n(Hallucinations)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Adverse effects)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(CYP2D6 gene|CYP2D6)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Antipsychotic Agents)\n(Schizophrenia)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Response to stimulus physiology)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Antidepressive Agents)\n(Schizophrenia)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Pathogenesis)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Genes)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Antidepressive Agents)\n(Schizophrenia)-PREDISPOSES->(Pathogenesis)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Genes)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Antiepileptic Agents)\n(Schizophrenia)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Pathogenesis)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(IMPACT gene)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Antiepileptic Agents)\n(Schizophrenia)-COMPLICATES/MANIFESTATION_OF->(Disease)-CAUSES->(Neurobehavioral Manifestations)\n(Hallucinations)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Functional disorder)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Genes)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Antipsychotic Agents)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Schizophrenia is primarily treated with antipsychotics, which work by blocking dopamine receptors to manage symptoms such as hallucinations and delusions. This aligns with the consensus that dopamine dysregulation is a key factor in schizophrenia. Antipsychotics are effective in reducing positive symptoms and may also help with negative and cognitive symptoms, although to a lesser extent. Evidence paths confirm the association between schizophrenia and antipsychotic agents, supporting their role in treatment. Antidepressants may be used for comorbid depression in schizophrenia but are not the primary treatment. Antiepileptics and mood stabilizers are not standard treatments for schizophrenia, though they may be used in specific cases for mood stabilization. The evidence paths related to antiepileptics and mood stabilizers do not provide strong support for their use as primary treatments in schizophrenia.\"\n}\n```",
