      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Which of the following causes retinal pigmentation?\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Quinine\nopb. Chloroquine\nopc. Mefloquine\nopd. Atovaquone\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Chloroquine\" -> \"accumulation in retinal pigment epithelium\" -> \"retinal pigmentation\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Quinine\" -> \"possible retinal toxicity\" -> \"unclear effect on pigmentation\" -> 40%\nCHAIN: \"Mefloquine\" -> \"no known effect on retinal pigmentation\" -> 10%\nCHAIN: \"Atovaquone\" -> \"no known effect on retinal pigmentation\" -> 10%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Chloroquine)-PART_OF->(Cells)-PART_OF->(Retina)\n(Chloroquine)-PART_OF->(Antigen-Presenting Cells)-PART_OF->(Retina)\n(Quinine)-ISA->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Genes)-PART_OF->(Retina)\n(Quinine)-TREATS->(Tachycardia, Ventricular)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Genes)-PART_OF->(Retina)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Chloroquine is known to cause retinal pigmentation due to its accumulation in the retinal pigment epithelium, which aligns with standard medical consensus. The retrieved evidence paths support this by indicating chloroquine's involvement with retinal cells. Quinine has potential retinal toxicity, but its effect on pigmentation is unclear and not well-supported by consensus. Mefloquine and Atovaquone have no known effects on retinal pigmentation, consistent with medical consensus. Therefore, chloroquine is the most likely cause of retinal pigmentation among the options provided.\"\n}\n```",
