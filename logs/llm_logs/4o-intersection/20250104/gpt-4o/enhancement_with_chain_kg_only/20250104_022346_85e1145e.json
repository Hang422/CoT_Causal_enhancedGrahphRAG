      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Physiology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        CAMP acts through:\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Activation of protein kinase\nopb. Activation of adenylate cyclase\nopc. Ca2+ release.\nopd. All\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"cAMP\" -> \"activation of protein kinase A\" -> \"phosphorylation of target proteins\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"cAMP\" -> \"activation of adenylate cyclase\" -> \"increased cAMP production\" -> 80%\nCHAIN: \"cAMP\" -> \"Ca2+ release\" -> \"possible\" -> 50%\nCHAIN: \"cAMP\" -> \"activation of protein kinase A\" -> \"activation of adenylate cyclase\" -> \"possible feedback loop\" -> 60%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(cyclic AMP)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Progestins)-PART_OF->(Cells)-LOCATION_OF->(Adenylate Cyclase)\n(cyclic AMP)-INTERACTS_WITH->(1-Methyl-3-isobutylxanthine)-PART_OF->(Cells)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Adenylate Cyclase)\n(cyclic AMP)-TREATS->(Symptoms)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(uptake)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(calcium ion)\n(cyclic AMP)-TREATS->(Symptoms)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(voltage gated channel)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(calcium ion)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Cyclic AMP (cAMP) primarily acts through the activation of protein kinase A (PKA), which then phosphorylates target proteins, leading to various cellular responses. This is the most well-established pathway and aligns with the consensus that cAMP activates protein kinase A. The chain suggesting cAMP activates adenylate cyclase is incorrect; adenylate cyclase is actually responsible for the production of cAMP from ATP, not activated by cAMP. The idea that cAMP directly causes Ca2+ release is not a primary mechanism; while cAMP can influence calcium channels indirectly, it is not a direct action of cAMP. The retrieved evidence paths, while broad, do not contradict the consensus that cAMP's primary action is through PKA activation. Therefore, the correct answer is that cAMP acts through the activation of protein kinase A.\"\n}\n```",
