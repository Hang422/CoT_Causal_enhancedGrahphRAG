      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Gastric irritation is least with following NSA1D: (PGI June 2008)\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Diclofenac\nopb. Acetaminophen\nopc. Ibuprofen\nopd. Naproxen\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Acetaminophen\" -> \"minimal COX inhibition in stomach\" -> \"least gastric irritation\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Diclofenac\" -> \"moderate COX inhibition\" -> \"some gastric irritation\" -> 60%\nCHAIN: \"Ibuprofen\" -> \"COX inhibition\" -> \"gastric irritation\" -> 50%\nCHAIN: \"Naproxen\" -> \"strong COX inhibition\" -> \"more gastric irritation\" -> 40%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Ibuprofen)-TREATS->(Obstruction)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Prostaglandin-Endoperoxide Synthase)\n(Acetaminophen)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Melatonin)-PART_OF->(Stomach)\n(Acetaminophen)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Enzymes)-PART_OF->(Stomach)\n(Diclofenac)-TREATS->(Complication)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Prostaglandin-Endoperoxide Synthase)\n(Diclofenac)-TREATS->(Inflammation)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Prostaglandin-Endoperoxide Synthase)\n(Ibuprofen)-TREATS->(Hypoxia)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Prostaglandin-Endoperoxide Synthase)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Acetaminophen is known to cause minimal gastric irritation because it primarily acts centrally and has negligible COX inhibition in the stomach, aligning with the consensus that it is the least likely to cause gastric irritation among the options. Diclofenac, ibuprofen, and naproxen are traditional NSAIDs that inhibit COX enzymes, leading to reduced prostaglandin synthesis and increased gastric irritation. Diclofenac and ibuprofen have moderate COX inhibition, while naproxen has strong COX inhibition, making it more likely to cause gastric irritation. The evidence paths confirm that acetaminophen interacts with stomach-related enzymes but do not directly inhibit COX in the stomach, supporting its minimal gastric irritation profile. Therefore, acetaminophen is the best choice for least gastric irritation.\"\n}\n```",
