      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Following a myocardial infarct, a 40-year-old man is being treated prophylactically with propranolol. You would be concerned about the use of this drug if the patient also had what comorbid condition\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Glaucoma\nopb. Essential tremor\nopc. Diabetes\nopd. Supraventricular tachycardia\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Propranolol\" -> \"beta-blocker\" -> \"decreased heart rate\" -> \"decreased hypoglycemia awareness\" -> \"Diabetes\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Propranolol\" -> \"beta-blocker\" -> \"bronchoconstriction\" -> \"possible asthma exacerbation\" -> \"unclear\" -> 60%\nCHAIN: \"Propranolol\" -> \"beta-blocker\" -> \"decreased heart rate\" -> \"decreased cardiac output\" -> \"Supraventricular tachycardia\" -> 70%\nCHAIN: \"Propranolol\" -> \"beta-blocker\" -> \"decreased intraocular pressure\" -> \"Glaucoma\" -> 50%\nCHAIN: \"Propranolol\" -> \"beta-blocker\" -> \"decreased tremor amplitude\" -> \"Essential tremor\" -> 40%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Propranolol)-INTERACTS_WITH/ISA->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Adrenergic beta-Antagonists)-Antagonists)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Propranolol is a non-selective beta-blocker commonly used for various cardiovascular conditions. In patients with diabetes, propranolol can mask symptoms of hypoglycemia, such as tachycardia, due to its effect on heart rate, making it a concern for diabetic patients. This aligns with the consensus that beta-blockers can decrease hypoglycemia awareness in diabetes. The evidence path confirms propranolol's classification as a beta-blocker, supporting its mechanism of action. For glaucoma, propranolol can decrease intraocular pressure, which is beneficial rather than concerning. In essential tremor, propranolol is often used therapeutically to reduce tremor amplitude. In supraventricular tachycardia, propranolol can be used to manage heart rate, not typically a concern unless contraindicated by other conditions. Therefore, the most concerning comorbid condition when using propranolol prophylactically after a myocardial infarction is diabetes due to the risk of masking hypoglycemia symptoms.\"\n}\n```",
