      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Biochemistry.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        The major vitamin deficiency in Wernicke's encephalopathy is :\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. B1\nopb. B2\nopc. B6\nopd. B12\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Wernicke's encephalopathy\" -> \"neurological symptoms\" -> \"thiamine deficiency\" -> \"vitamin B1\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Wernicke's encephalopathy\" -> \"alcoholism association\" -> \"malnutrition\" -> \"thiamine deficiency\" -> \"vitamin B1\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Wernicke's encephalopathy\" -> \"confusion and ataxia\" -> \"thiamine deficiency\" -> \"vitamin B1\" -> 92%\nCHAIN: \"Wernicke's encephalopathy\" -> \"ocular abnormalities\" -> \"thiamine deficiency\" -> \"vitamin B1\" -> 93%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Wernicke Encephalopathy)-CAUSES->(Neurologic Symptoms)\n(Wernicke Encephalopathy)-ISA->(Alcoholic Intoxication, Chronic)\n(Wernicke Encephalopathy)-CAUSES->(Ataxia)\n(Neurologic Symptoms)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Beriberi)\n(Alcoholic Intoxication, Chronic)-CAUSES->(Malnutrition)\n(Malnutrition)-CAUSES->(Beriberi)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Wernicke's encephalopathy is primarily associated with a deficiency in vitamin B1, also known as thiamine. This condition is characterized by neurological symptoms such as confusion, ataxia, and ocular abnormalities. The condition is often linked to chronic alcoholism, which can lead to malnutrition and subsequently thiamine deficiency. The retrieved evidence paths support this by showing the association between Wernicke's encephalopathy and neurological symptoms, as well as its connection to chronic alcoholism and malnutrition. Therefore, the major vitamin deficiency in Wernicke's encephalopathy is vitamin B1.\"\n}\n```",
