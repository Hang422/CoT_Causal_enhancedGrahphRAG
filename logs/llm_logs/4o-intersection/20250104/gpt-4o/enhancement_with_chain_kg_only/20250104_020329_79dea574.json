      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Biochemistry.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        A 6-month-old male baby comes with vomiting, lethargy and severe jaundice when weaning was staed with fruit juice. Which of the following enzymes is defective?\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Fructokinase\nopb. Aldolase A\nopc. Aldolase B\nopd. Sucrase\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Weaning with fruit juice\" -> \"Fructose intake\" -> \"Fructose metabolism required\" -> \"Aldolase B needed\" -> \"Aldolase B deficiency\" -> \"Accumulation of toxic metabolites\" -> \"Vomiting, lethargy, severe jaundice\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Weaning with fruit juice\" -> \"Fructose intake\" -> \"Fructose metabolism required\" -> \"Fructokinase needed\" -> \"Fructokinase deficiency\" -> \"Possible mild symptoms\" -> \"Unlikely severe jaundice\" -> 40%\nCHAIN: \"Weaning with fruit juice\" -> \"Fructose intake\" -> \"Fructose metabolism required\" -> \"Aldolase A needed\" -> \"Aldolase A deficiency\" -> \"Unlikely related to fructose metabolism\" -> \"Unlikely severe jaundice\" -> 30%\nCHAIN: \"Weaning with fruit juice\" -> \"Fructose intake\" -> \"Fructose metabolism required\" -> \"Sucrase not involved\" -> \"Unrelated to symptoms\" -> 20%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(FRUCTOKINASE)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cells)-LOCATION_OF->(Fructose)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Deficiency of fructokinase)\n(FRUCTOKINASE)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cells)-INTERACTS_WITH->(mutant gene)-CAUSES->(Deficiency of fructokinase)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"The symptoms of vomiting, lethargy, and severe jaundice in a 6-month-old baby after weaning with fruit juice suggest a defect in fructose metabolism. The most likely enzyme deficiency is Aldolase B, which is crucial for the breakdown of fructose-1-phosphate. A deficiency in Aldolase B leads to the accumulation of toxic metabolites, causing the observed symptoms. This aligns with the consensus that Aldolase B deficiency, known as Hereditary Fructose Intolerance, results in severe symptoms upon fructose ingestion. Fructokinase deficiency, while related to fructose metabolism, typically results in benign symptoms and is unlikely to cause severe jaundice. Aldolase A is not primarily involved in fructose metabolism, and sucrase is unrelated to fructose metabolism. The retrieved evidence paths regarding fructokinase deficiency are not directly relevant to the severe symptoms observed in this case.\"\n}\n```",
