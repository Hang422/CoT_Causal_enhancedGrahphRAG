      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Pulmonary fibrosis is a complication of: March 2011, March 2012, September 2012, March 2013\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Methotrexate\nopb. Doxorubicin\nopc. Cisplatin\nopd. Busulfan\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Methotrexate\" -> \"immunosuppressive therapy\" -> \"potential lung toxicity\" -> \"pulmonary fibrosis\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Doxorubicin\" -> \"chemotherapy agent\" -> \"cardiotoxicity\" -> \"less common lung toxicity\" -> \"pulmonary fibrosis\" -> 60%\nCHAIN: \"Cisplatin\" -> \"chemotherapy agent\" -> \"nephrotoxicity\" -> \"ototoxicity\" -> \"less common lung toxicity\" -> \"pulmonary fibrosis\" -> 55%\nCHAIN: \"Busulfan\" -> \"alkylating agent\" -> \"known lung toxicity\" -> \"pulmonary fibrosis\" -> 95%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Busulfan)-TREATS->(Functional disorder)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Melphalan)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Alkylating Agents)\n(Busulfan)-CAUSES->(Graft acceptance)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Melphalan)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Alkylating Agents)\n(Methotrexate)-INTERACTS_WITH->(T-Lymphocyte)-PART_OF->(Myocardium)-LOCATION_OF->(Therapeutic immunosuppression)\n(Methotrexate)-INTERACTS_WITH->(T-Lymphocyte)-PART_OF->(Biopsy sample)-LOCATION_OF->(Therapeutic immunosuppression)\n(Lung)-LOCATION_OF->(Pulmonary Fibrosis)\n(Toxic nephropathy)-COMPLICATES->(Disease)-CAUSES->(Ototoxicity)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Pulmonary fibrosis is a known complication of certain medications, particularly those with lung toxicity. Methotrexate, an immunosuppressive therapy, is associated with potential lung toxicity and can lead to pulmonary fibrosis, aligning with the consensus that it is a recognized risk. The evidence paths support its interaction with immune cells, which can contribute to lung complications. Doxorubicin, primarily known for cardiotoxicity, has less common associations with lung toxicity and pulmonary fibrosis, making it a less likely cause. Cisplatin is mainly associated with nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity, with pulmonary fibrosis being a rare complication, thus less relevant. Busulfan, an alkylating agent, is well-documented to cause lung toxicity and is strongly associated with pulmonary fibrosis, supported by its classification and known effects. Therefore, Busulfan is the most likely option to cause pulmonary fibrosis, followed by Methotrexate, while Doxorubicin and Cisplatin are less commonly implicated.\"\n}\n```",
