He has a history of being treated for duodenal ulcer 4 years back. Investigation reveals elevation of gastrin levels. Which of the following statement is true regarding gastrin?\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Secreted by parietal cells of stomach\nopb. Secreted by alpha ceils of pancreas\nopc. Decreases bicarbonate content in pancreatic secretion\nopd. It gets stimulated by endoluminal peptides in stomach\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Gastrin\" -> \"secreted by G cells in stomach\" -> \"stimulated by peptides in stomach\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Gastrin\" -> \"stimulated by endoluminal peptides\" -> \"increased gastric acid secretion\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Gastrin\" -> \"elevated levels\" -> \"possible Zollinger-Ellison syndrome\" -> 80%\nCHAIN: \"Gastrin\" -> \"not secreted by parietal cells\" -> \"secreted by G cells\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Gastrin\" -> \"not secreted by alpha cells of pancreas\" -> \"secreted by G cells in stomach\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Gastrin\" -> \"does not decrease bicarbonate content\" -> \"increases gastric acid secretion\" -> 90%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Gastrins)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cells)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Parietal Cells, Gastric)\n(Gastrins)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cells)-LOCATION_OF->(Bicarbonates)\n(Gastrins)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cells)-PART_OF->(Stomach)\n(Gastrins)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cells)-PART_OF->(Pancreas)\n(Gastrin-Secreting Cells)-PART_OF->(Stomach)\n(Pancreas)-PART_OF->(Stomach)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Gastrin is a hormone secreted by G cells in the stomach, not by parietal cells or alpha cells of the pancreas. It is stimulated by peptides in the stomach, which aligns with the consensus that gastrin is released in response to the presence of peptides and amino acids in the gastric lumen. This stimulation leads to increased gastric acid secretion, not a decrease in bicarbonate content. The evidence paths confirm that gastrin interacts with cells in the stomach and is part of the gastric system, supporting the consensus that it is not associated with the pancreas or its alpha cells. Therefore, the correct statement regarding gastrin is that it gets stimulated by endoluminal peptides in the stomach.\"\n}\n```",
