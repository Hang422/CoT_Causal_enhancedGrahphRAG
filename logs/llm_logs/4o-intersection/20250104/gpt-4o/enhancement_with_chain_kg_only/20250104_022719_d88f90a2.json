      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Drug of choice for relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis is:\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Alpha IEN\nopb. Beta IFN\nopc. Gamma IFN\nopd. Natalizumab\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Beta IFN\" -> \"modulates immune response\" -> \"reduces inflammation\" -> \"decreases relapse rate\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Natalizumab\" -> \"blocks immune cell migration\" -> \"prevents CNS inflammation\" -> \"reduces relapse frequency\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Gamma IFN\" -> \"possible immune modulation\" -> \"unclear effect on MS\" -> \"potential worsening of symptoms\" -> 40%\nCHAIN: \"Alpha IEN\" -> \"unclear mechanism in MS\" -> \"no established benefit\" -> \"not recommended for MS\" -> 30%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Recombinant Interleukin-6)-6)->(Thrombocytopenia)-CAUSES/MANIFESTATION_OF->(Disease)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Immunity)\n(natalizumab)-INTERACTS_WITH->(T-Lymphocyte)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Immune Cell)\n(natalizumab)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cells)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Immune Cell)\n(Immunity)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-ASSOCIATED_WITH/TREATS->(Inflammation)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"For relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS), the drug of choice is typically Beta Interferon (Beta IFN). Beta IFN modulates the immune response, reduces inflammation, and decreases the relapse rate, which aligns with standard medical consensus. Natalizumab is another effective treatment option; it works by blocking immune cell migration, thereby preventing CNS inflammation and reducing relapse frequency. However, it is generally considered when patients do not respond to first-line treatments like Beta IFN. Gamma Interferon is not recommended for MS as it may worsen symptoms. Alpha IEN lacks an established benefit for MS and is not recommended. The evidence paths confirm the role of natalizumab in interacting with immune cells, supporting its mechanism of action in preventing CNS inflammation. Overall, Beta IFN remains the first-line treatment for RRMS.\"\n}\n```",
