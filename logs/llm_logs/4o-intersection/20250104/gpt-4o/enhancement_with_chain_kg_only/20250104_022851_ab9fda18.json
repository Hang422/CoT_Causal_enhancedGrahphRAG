      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        A Patient who is on antihypertensive drug develops a dry cough. Which of the following drug might be responsible for the condition:\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Diuretics\nopb. ACE inhibitors\nopc. Calcium channel blockers\nopd. Beta blockers\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"ACE inhibitors\" -> \"increased bradykinin\" -> \"dry cough\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Diuretics\" -> \"possible electrolyte imbalance\" -> \"unclear relation to dry cough\" -> 40%\nCHAIN: \"Calcium channel blockers\" -> \"vasodilation\" -> \"unclear relation to dry cough\" -> 30%\nCHAIN: \"Beta blockers\" -> \"bronchoconstriction\" -> \"possible cough\" -> 50%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Electrolytes)-COMPLICATES/TREATS->(Disease)-CAUSES->(Non-productive cough)-productive cough)\n(Calcium Channel Blockers)-CAUSES->(Vasodilation)\n(Bradykinin)-TREATS->(Disease)-CAUSES->(Non-productive cough)\n(Bradykinin)-CAUSES->(Symptoms)-CAUSES->(Non-productive cough)\n(Diuretics)-CAUSES->(Excretory function)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Electrolytes)\n(imbalance)-CAUSES/PREDISPOSES->(Disease)-CAUSES->(Non-productive cough)-productive cough)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"ACE inhibitors are well-known to cause a dry cough due to the accumulation of bradykinin, which is a consensus-supported side effect. The reasoning chain for ACE inhibitors correctly identifies this mechanism, supported by evidence paths indicating bradykinin's role in causing non-productive coughs. Diuretics, while they can cause electrolyte imbalances, do not have a direct or well-established link to causing a dry cough. Calcium channel blockers primarily cause vasodilation and are not associated with dry coughs. Beta blockers can cause bronchoconstriction, which might lead to a cough, but this is not as common or specific as the cough associated with ACE inhibitors. Therefore, the most likely drug responsible for the dry cough in this scenario is an ACE inhibitor.\"\n}\n```",
