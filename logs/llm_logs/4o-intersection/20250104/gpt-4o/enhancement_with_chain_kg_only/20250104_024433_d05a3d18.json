      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Physiology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Testosterone production is mainly contributed by\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Leydig cells\nopb. Seolie cells\nopc. Seminiferous tubules\nopd. Epididymis\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Leydig cells\" -> \"testosterone production\" -> \"primary source\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Seolie cells\" -> \"possible misinterpretation\" -> \"not known for testosterone production\" -> 10%\nCHAIN: \"Seminiferous tubules\" -> \"sperm production\" -> \"not primary testosterone source\" -> 20%\nCHAIN: \"Epididymis\" -> \"sperm maturation\" -> \"not involved in testosterone production\" -> 5%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Structure of interstitial cell of Leydig)-LOCATION_OF->(Testosterone)\n(sperm cell)-PART_OF->(Column)-LOCATION_OF->(Testosterone)\n(sperm cell)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cells)-LOCATION_OF->(Testosterone)\n(Seminiferous tubule structure)-LOCATION_OF->(Lipids)-PART_OF->(sperm cell)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Testosterone production is primarily attributed to Leydig cells, which are located in the interstitial tissue of the testes. This aligns with the consensus that Leydig cells are the main source of testosterone production. The evidence path indicating the 'Structure of interstitial cell of Leydig' being the 'LOCATION_OF' testosterone supports this consensus. The other options, such as Sertoli cells (misinterpreted as 'Seolie cells'), seminiferous tubules, and the epididymis, are not primarily involved in testosterone production. Sertoli cells are involved in nurturing sperm cells, seminiferous tubules are the site of sperm production, and the epididymis is involved in sperm maturation, none of which are directly responsible for testosterone synthesis.\"\n}\n```",
