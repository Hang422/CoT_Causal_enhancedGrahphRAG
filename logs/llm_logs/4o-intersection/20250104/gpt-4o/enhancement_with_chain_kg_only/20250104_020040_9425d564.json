      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Physiology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Which of the following peptides are not produced by the renal system?\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Renin\nopb. Angiotensin I\nopc. Erythropoietin\nopd. 1,25DHCC\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Renin\" -> \"produced by juxtaglomerular cells in kidneys\" -> \"part of renal system\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Angiotensin I\" -> \"produced by conversion of angiotensinogen by renin\" -> \"occurs in bloodstream\" -> \"not directly produced by renal system\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Erythropoietin\" -> \"produced by interstitial fibroblasts in kidneys\" -> \"part of renal system\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"1,25DHCC\" -> \"active form of vitamin D\" -> \"converted in kidneys\" -> \"produced by renal system\" -> 90%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Angiotensin I)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Endothelial Cells)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cells)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Renin)\n(Angiotensin I)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Myocytes, Smooth Muscle)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Hematopoietic stem cells)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Renin)\n(Renin)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cells)-PART_OF->(Kidney)\n(Renin)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Lymphocyte)-PART_OF->(Kidney)\n(Erythropoietin)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Lymphocyte)-PART_OF->(Kidney)\n(Erythropoietin)-INTERACTS_WITH->(MONONUCLEAR CELLS)-PART_OF->(Kidney)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Renin is produced by the juxtaglomerular cells in the kidneys, confirming it is part of the renal system. Angiotensin I is formed in the bloodstream through the conversion of angiotensinogen by renin, indicating it is not directly produced by the renal system. Erythropoietin is produced by interstitial fibroblasts in the kidneys, making it part of the renal system. 1,25-Dihydroxycholecalciferol (1,25DHCC), the active form of vitamin D, is converted in the kidneys, thus it is associated with the renal system. Therefore, Angiotensin I is the peptide not directly produced by the renal system. The evidence paths confirm the interactions and production sites of these peptides, supporting the consensus that Angiotensin I is not directly produced by the renal system.\"\n}\n```",
