      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Biochemistry.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Which of the following vitamin reduces the risk of insulin resistance, obesity, and the metabolic syndrome?\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Vitamin A\nopb. Vitamin C\nopc. Vitamin D\nopd. Vitamin B12\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Vitamin D\" -> \"improved insulin sensitivity\" -> \"reduced insulin resistance\" -> \"decreased risk of obesity\" -> \"lowered risk of metabolic syndrome\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Vitamin A\" -> \"antioxidant properties\" -> \"possible reduction in oxidative stress\" -> \"unclear impact on insulin resistance\" -> 50%\nCHAIN: \"Vitamin C\" -> \"antioxidant properties\" -> \"possible reduction in inflammation\" -> \"unclear impact on insulin resistance\" -> 50%\nCHAIN: \"Vitamin B12\" -> \"role in energy metabolism\" -> \"possible impact on weight management\" -> \"unclear impact on insulin resistance\" -> 50%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Vitamin D2)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(insulin sensitivity)\n(Vitamin B 12)-ASSOCIATED_WITH/TREATS->(Mood Disorders)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Energy Metabolism)\n(Insulin Resistance)-COMPLICATES/MANIFESTATION_OF->(Obesity)\n(Obesity)-CAUSES/PREDISPOSES->(Metabolic Syndrome X)\n(insulin sensitivity)-COMPLICATES/MANIFESTATION_OF->(Insulin Resistance)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Vitamin D is widely recognized for its role in improving insulin sensitivity, which can lead to reduced insulin resistance. This reduction in insulin resistance is associated with a decreased risk of obesity and metabolic syndrome. The retrieved evidence path supports this by linking Vitamin D with insulin sensitivity, which is a key factor in managing insulin resistance. In contrast, Vitamin A and Vitamin C, while having antioxidant properties, do not have a clear or direct impact on insulin resistance according to current consensus. Vitamin B12 is primarily involved in energy metabolism and mood disorders, with no strong evidence supporting its role in reducing insulin resistance. Therefore, Vitamin D is the most supported option for reducing the risk of insulin resistance, obesity, and metabolic syndrome.\"\n}\n```",
