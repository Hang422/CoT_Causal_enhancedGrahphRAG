      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Biochemistry.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Cholesterol from the liver is transpoed to the peripheral tissue mainly by:\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. HDL\nopb. LDL\nopc. VLDL\nopd. Chylomicrons\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Cholesterol synthesis in liver\" -> \"Cholesterol packaged into VLDL\" -> \"VLDL converted to LDL in bloodstream\" -> \"LDL transports cholesterol to peripheral tissues\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Cholesterol synthesis in liver\" -> \"Cholesterol packaged into VLDL\" -> \"VLDL delivers triglycerides to tissues\" -> \"VLDL remnants converted to LDL\" -> \"LDL delivers cholesterol to peripheral tissues\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Cholesterol synthesis in liver\" -> \"Cholesterol packaged into HDL\" -> \"HDL primarily involved in reverse cholesterol transport\" -> \"HDL not main transporter to peripheral tissues\" -> 30%\nCHAIN: \"Cholesterol synthesis in liver\" -> \"Cholesterol packaged into chylomicrons\" -> \"Chylomicrons primarily transport dietary lipids\" -> \"Chylomicrons not main transporter to peripheral tissues\" -> 20%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Liver)-LOCATION_OF->(Diastasis)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Chylomicrons)\n(Liver)-LOCATION_OF->(Functional disorder)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Chylomicrons)\n(Triglycerides)-PART_OF->(Cells)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Low-Density Lipoproteins)\n(Triglycerides)-PART_OF->(Cultured Cells)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Low-Density Lipoproteins)\n(Body tissue)-LOCATION_OF->(Low-Density Lipoproteins)\n(Liver)-LOCATION_OF->(High Density Lipoproteins)\n(Very low density lipoprotein)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Adipocytes)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Low-Density Lipoproteins)-Density Lipoproteins)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"The primary transporter of cholesterol from the liver to peripheral tissues is Low-Density Lipoprotein (LDL). Cholesterol is synthesized in the liver and initially packaged into Very Low-Density Lipoproteins (VLDL). VLDL delivers triglycerides to tissues and is subsequently converted into LDL in the bloodstream. LDL is then responsible for transporting cholesterol to peripheral tissues. This aligns with the consensus that LDL is the main carrier of cholesterol to peripheral tissues. High-Density Lipoprotein (HDL) is primarily involved in reverse cholesterol transport, moving cholesterol from peripheral tissues back to the liver, not the other way around. Chylomicrons mainly transport dietary lipids from the intestines, not cholesterol from the liver. The evidence paths support the interaction of triglycerides with LDL and the role of VLDL in the conversion process, confirming the consensus that LDL is the main transporter of cholesterol to peripheral tissues.\"\n}\n```",
