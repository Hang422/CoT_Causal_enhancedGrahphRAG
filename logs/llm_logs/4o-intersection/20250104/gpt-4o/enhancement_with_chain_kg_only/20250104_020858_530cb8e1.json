      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Hypothyroidism is caused by which of the following anti-tubercular drug -\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. PAS\nopb. Ethionamide\nopc. Cycloserine\nopd. Pyrazinamide\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Ethionamide\" -> \"inhibits thyroid hormone synthesis\" -> \"reduced thyroid hormone levels\" -> \"hypothyroidism\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"PAS\" -> \"possible interference with thyroid function\" -> \"unclear impact on thyroid hormone levels\" -> \"possible hypothyroidism\" -> 60%\nCHAIN: \"Cycloserine\" -> \"no known effect on thyroid function\" -> \"unlikely to cause hypothyroidism\" -> 20%\nCHAIN: \"Pyrazinamide\" -> \"no known effect on thyroid function\" -> \"unlikely to cause hypothyroidism\" -> 20%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(thyroid function)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Thyrotropin)-TREATS->(Hypothyroidism)\n(Ethionamide)-TREATS->(Infection)-MANIFESTATION_OF/PREDISPOSES->(Pathogenesis)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Thyroid Hormones)\n(p-Aminosalicylic Acid)-Aminosalicylic Acid)->(Disease)-CAUSES/COMPLICATES->(Heart failure)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(thyroid function)\n(Cycloserine)-CAUSES->(Symptoms)-ASSOCIATED_WITH/CAUSES->(Heart failure)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(thyroid function)\n(Pyrazinamide)-TREATS->(Disease)-CAUSES/COMPLICATES->(Heart failure)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(thyroid function)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Ethionamide is known to inhibit thyroid hormone synthesis, which can lead to reduced thyroid hormone levels and potentially cause hypothyroidism. This aligns with the consensus that ethionamide can cause hypothyroidism as a side effect. The evidence path associating ethionamide with thyroid hormones supports this reasoning. PAS (p-Aminosalicylic Acid) has a possible but unclear impact on thyroid function, and there is no strong consensus or evidence linking it directly to hypothyroidism. Cycloserine and Pyrazinamide have no known effects on thyroid function and are unlikely to cause hypothyroidism, as supported by the lack of relevant evidence paths. Therefore, ethionamide is the most likely anti-tubercular drug to cause hypothyroidism.\"\n}\n```",
