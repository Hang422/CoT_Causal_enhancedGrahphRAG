      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Drug given for antibiotic associated pseudomembranous enterocolitis and is part of anti H. Pylori treatment:\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Amoxicillin\nopb. Vancomycin\nopc. Metronidazole\nopd. Clotrimazole\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Amoxicillin\" -> \"broad-spectrum antibiotic\" -> \"part of anti H. Pylori treatment\" -> 70%\nCHAIN: \"Vancomycin\" -> \"treatment for antibiotic-associated pseudomembranous enterocolitis\" -> \"not typically part of anti H. Pylori treatment\" -> 60%\nCHAIN: \"Metronidazole\" -> \"effective against anaerobic bacteria\" -> \"part of anti H. Pylori treatment\" -> 80%\nCHAIN: \"Clotrimazole\" -> \"antifungal medication\" -> \"not used for bacterial infections\" -> 10%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Metronidazole)-TREATS->(Disease)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Bacteria, Anaerobic)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Metronidazole is the correct choice as it is effective against anaerobic bacteria and is part of the standard treatment regimen for Helicobacter pylori infections. It is also used in the treatment of antibiotic-associated pseudomembranous enterocolitis, typically caused by Clostridioides difficile, due to its efficacy against anaerobic bacteria. The retrieved evidence path supports its role in treating diseases associated with anaerobic bacteria. Amoxicillin is a broad-spectrum antibiotic and part of the anti-H. pylori treatment but is not used for pseudomembranous enterocolitis. Vancomycin is used for pseudomembranous enterocolitis but not typically for H. pylori. Clotrimazole is an antifungal and not relevant to bacterial infections like those caused by H. pylori or C. difficile.\"\n}\n```",
