      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Drug of choice for bleeding oesophageal varices is?\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Ethanolamine oleate\nopb. Octreotide\nopc. Propanolol\nopd. Phytonadione\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Octreotide\" -> \"vasoconstriction of splanchnic circulation\" -> \"reduced portal pressure\" -> \"control of bleeding oesophageal varices\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Propranolol\" -> \"beta-blockade\" -> \"reduced portal hypertension\" -> \"prevention of variceal bleeding\" -> 70%\nCHAIN: \"Ethanolamine oleate\" -> \"sclerotherapy\" -> \"obliteration of varices\" -> \"control of bleeding\" -> 60%\nCHAIN: \"Phytonadione\" -> \"vitamin K supplementation\" -> \"improved coagulation\" -> \"possible reduction in bleeding\" -> 50%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Octreotide)-TREATS->(Disease)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Blood Circulation)\n(Octreotide)-TREATS->(Complication)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Blood Circulation)\n(Vitamin K 1)-INTERACTS_WITH/ISA->(Vitamin K)\n(Varicosity)-CAUSES/PREDISPOSES->(Intracranial Hemorrhages)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Genes)-PART_OF->(Mucous Membrane)-LOCATION_OF->(Control of hemorrhage)\n(Sclerotherapy)-CAUSES/PREVENTS->(Varicosity)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"The drug of choice for bleeding oesophageal varices is Octreotide. Octreotide works by causing vasoconstriction of the splanchnic circulation, which reduces portal pressure and helps control bleeding from oesophageal varices. This aligns with the consensus that Octreotide is effective in acute management of variceal bleeding. Propranolol, while useful in preventing variceal bleeding by reducing portal hypertension, is not the first choice for acute bleeding. Ethanolamine oleate is used in sclerotherapy to obliterate varices, but it is not the primary pharmacological treatment. Phytonadione (Vitamin K) improves coagulation but is not directly effective in controlling variceal bleeding. The evidence paths support Octreotide's role in treating complications related to blood circulation, confirming its relevance in managing bleeding oesophageal varices.\"\n}\n```",
