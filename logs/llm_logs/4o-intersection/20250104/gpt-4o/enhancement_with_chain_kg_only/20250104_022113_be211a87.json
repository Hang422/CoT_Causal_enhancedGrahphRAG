      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Treatment for scabies is\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Erythromycin\nopb. Benzene hexachloride\nopc. Piperazine\nopd. Thiabendazole\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Erythromycin\" -> \"antibiotic\" -> \"targets bacterial infections\" -> \"not effective for scabies\" -> 20%\nCHAIN: \"Benzene hexachloride\" -> \"also known as Lindane\" -> \"used as a topical treatment\" -> \"kills scabies mites\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Piperazine\" -> \"anthelmintic\" -> \"treats worm infections\" -> \"not effective for scabies\" -> 10%\nCHAIN: \"Thiabendazole\" -> \"anthelmintic\" -> \"treats worm infections\" -> \"not effective for scabies\" -> 10%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Thiabendazole)-TREATS->(Disease)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Immunity)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Anthelmintics)\n(Thiabendazole)-TREATS->(Infection)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Immunity)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Anthelmintics)\n(piperazine)-TREATS->(Edema)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(ADRBK1 gene|GRK2)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Anthelmintics)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Scabies is a skin infestation caused by the mite Sarcoptes scabiei. The standard treatment for scabies involves topical scabicides. Erythromycin is an antibiotic effective against bacterial infections, not scabies, and thus is not suitable for this condition. Benzene hexachloride, also known as Lindane, is a topical treatment specifically used to kill scabies mites, making it an effective treatment for scabies. Piperazine and Thiabendazole are anthelmintics used to treat worm infections and are not effective against scabies mites. Therefore, the correct treatment for scabies is Benzene hexachloride (Lindane).\"\n}\n```",
