      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Physiology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Growth hormone has its effect on growth through?\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Directly\nopb. IG1-1\nopc. Thyroxine\nopd. Intranuclear receptors\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Growth hormone\" -> \"liver\" -> \"IGF-1 production\" -> \"growth effects\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Growth hormone\" -> \"IGF-1\" -> \"bone growth\" -> \"increased height\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Growth hormone\" -> \"IGF-1\" -> \"muscle growth\" -> \"increased muscle mass\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Growth hormone\" -> \"IGF-1\" -> \"cell proliferation\" -> \"tissue growth\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Growth hormone\" -> \"possible direct effects\" -> \"unclear significance\" -> 60%\nCHAIN: \"Growth hormone\" -> \"possible interaction with thyroxine\" -> \"unclear growth effect\" -> 50%\nCHAIN: \"Growth hormone\" -> \"intranuclear receptors\" -> \"unclear mechanism\" -> 40%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Somatotropin)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cells)-LOCATION_OF->(Thyroxine)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Growth hormone primarily exerts its effects on growth through the production of Insulin-like Growth Factor 1 (IGF-1) in the liver. This is the consensus-supported mechanism, as IGF-1 mediates growth effects such as bone growth, increased height, muscle growth, and tissue proliferation. While growth hormone may have some direct effects, these are not well-defined or significant compared to its action through IGF-1. The interaction with thyroxine and intranuclear receptors is not a primary mechanism for growth hormone's effects on growth. Therefore, the most accurate option is that growth hormone affects growth through IGF-1.\"\n}\n```",
