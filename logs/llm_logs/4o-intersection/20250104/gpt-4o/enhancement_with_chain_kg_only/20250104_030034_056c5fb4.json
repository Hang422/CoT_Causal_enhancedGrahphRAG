      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Drug of choice for gonococcal as well as non gonococcal urethritis is\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Clindamycin\nopb. Cefepime\nopc. Metronidazole\nopd. Azithromycin\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Azithromycin\" -> \"effective against Chlamydia trachomatis\" -> \"covers non-gonococcal urethritis\" -> \"also effective against Neisseria gonorrhoeae\" -> \"covers gonococcal urethritis\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Clindamycin\" -> \"effective against anaerobic bacteria\" -> \"not effective against Neisseria gonorrhoeae\" -> \"not effective against Chlamydia trachomatis\" -> 10%\nCHAIN: \"Cefepime\" -> \"broad-spectrum cephalosporin\" -> \"effective against some gram-negative bacteria\" -> \"not typically used for urethritis\" -> 20%\nCHAIN: \"Metronidazole\" -> \"effective against anaerobic bacteria and protozoa\" -> \"not effective against Neisseria gonorrhoeae\" -> \"not effective against Chlamydia trachomatis\" -> 10%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Clindamycin)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Disease)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Bacteria, Anaerobic)\n(Clindamycin)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Infection)-PROCESS_OF->(Bacteria, Anaerobic)\n(Metronidazole)-TREATS->(Disease)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Bacteria, Anaerobic)\n(Metronidazole)-TREATS->(Infection)-PROCESS_OF->(Bacteria, Anaerobic)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Azithromycin is the drug of choice for both gonococcal and non-gonococcal urethritis. It is effective against Chlamydia trachomatis, which causes non-gonococcal urethritis, and also has activity against Neisseria gonorrhoeae, responsible for gonococcal urethritis. Clindamycin is primarily effective against anaerobic bacteria and is not suitable for treating urethritis caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae or Chlamydia trachomatis. Cefepime, a broad-spectrum cephalosporin, is not typically used for urethritis as it does not specifically target the pathogens involved. Metronidazole is effective against anaerobic bacteria and protozoa but not against the bacteria causing gonococcal or non-gonococcal urethritis. The evidence paths confirm the limited scope of Clindamycin and Metronidazole, supporting their ineffectiveness for urethritis treatment.\"\n}\n```",
