      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Chloroquine is useful in\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Discoid lupus erythematous\nopb. Rheumatoid ahritis\nopc. Infectious mononucleosis\nopd. All of the above\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Chloroquine\" -> \"anti-inflammatory effects\" -> \"improvement in discoid lupus erythematosus\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Chloroquine\" -> \"immunomodulatory effects\" -> \"potential benefit in rheumatoid arthritis\" -> 70%\nCHAIN: \"Chloroquine\" -> \"antiviral properties\" -> \"unclear effect on infectious mononucleosis\" -> 40%\nCHAIN: \"Chloroquine\" -> \"useful in discoid lupus erythematosus\" -> \"possible benefit in rheumatoid arthritis\" -> \"unclear effect on infectious mononucleosis\" -> 50%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Chloroquine)-TREATS->(Lupus Erythematosus, Discoid)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Chloroquine is well-established for its use in treating discoid lupus erythematosus due to its anti-inflammatory effects, as supported by the evidence path indicating its treatment role in lupus erythematosus. While chloroquine has immunomodulatory effects that suggest potential benefit in rheumatoid arthritis, it is not a standard treatment for this condition, and its use is less supported by consensus. Chloroquine's antiviral properties do not provide a clear benefit for infectious mononucleosis, as this condition is typically self-limiting and not treated with chloroquine. Therefore, chloroquine is primarily useful in discoid lupus erythematosus, aligning with the consensus and evidence provided.\"\n}\n```",
