      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Aminoglycoside affects ?\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Outer hair cells in basal area\nopb. Inner hair cells in basal area\nopc. Outer hair cells in apical area\nopd. Inner hair cells in apical area\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Aminoglycoside\" -> \"ototoxicity\" -> \"damage to cochlear hair cells\" -> \"outer hair cells\" -> \"basal area\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Aminoglycoside\" -> \"ototoxicity\" -> \"damage to cochlear hair cells\" -> \"inner hair cells\" -> \"basal area\" -> 60%\nCHAIN: \"Aminoglycoside\" -> \"ototoxicity\" -> \"damage to cochlear hair cells\" -> \"outer hair cells\" -> \"apical area\" -> 50%\nCHAIN: \"Aminoglycoside\" -> \"ototoxicity\" -> \"damage to cochlear hair cells\" -> \"inner hair cells\" -> \"apical area\" -> 40%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Aminoglycosides)-ASSOCIATED_WITH/CAUSES->(Ototoxicity)\n(Hair Cells, Outer)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cells)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Serous cell)-PART_OF->(Structure of mitral area)\n(Hair Cells, Outer)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cells)-PART_OF->(Entire large artery)-PART_OF->(Structure of mitral area)\n(Hair Cells, Inner)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cells)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Serous cell)-PART_OF->(Structure of mitral area)\n(Hair Cells, Inner)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cells)-PART_OF->(Entire large artery)-PART_OF->(Structure of mitral area)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Aminoglycosides are known to cause ototoxicity, primarily affecting the cochlear hair cells. The consensus in medical literature is that aminoglycosides predominantly damage the outer hair cells, particularly in the basal area of the cochlea. This is because the basal area is responsible for high-frequency sound detection, which is often the first to be affected in ototoxicity. The evidence paths confirm the association between aminoglycosides and ototoxicity but do not provide specific insights into the location of damage within the cochlea. Therefore, the most supported conclusion is that aminoglycosides affect the outer hair cells in the basal area.\"\n}\n```",
