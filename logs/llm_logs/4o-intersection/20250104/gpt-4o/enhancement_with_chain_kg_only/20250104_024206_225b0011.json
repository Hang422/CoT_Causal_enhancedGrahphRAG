      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Triamterene causes\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Better glucose tolerance\nopb. Muscle cramps\nopc. Decrease in urea level\nopd. Hypokalemia\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Triamterene\" -> \"potassium-sparing diuretic\" -> \"retention of potassium\" -> \"hyperkalemia\" -> 0%\nCHAIN: \"Triamterene\" -> \"potassium retention\" -> \"muscle cramps\" -> 70%\nCHAIN: \"Triamterene\" -> \"no direct effect on glucose metabolism\" -> \"unlikely to affect glucose tolerance\" -> 20%\nCHAIN: \"Triamterene\" -> \"diuretic effect\" -> \"possible decrease in urea reabsorption\" -> \"possible decrease in urea level\" -> 50%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Triamterene)-ISA->(Potassium Sparing Diuretics)\n(Potassium Sparing Diuretics)-CAUSES->(Excretory function)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(potassium)\n(potassium)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Disease)-CAUSES->(hyperkalemia)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Triamterene is a potassium-sparing diuretic, which means it helps retain potassium in the body, potentially leading to hyperkalemia rather than hypokalemia. Therefore, option 'opd' (Hypokalemia) is incorrect. The retention of potassium can sometimes lead to muscle cramps, making option 'opb' (Muscle cramps) plausible. Triamterene does not have a direct effect on glucose metabolism, so it is unlikely to improve glucose tolerance, making option 'opa' (Better glucose tolerance) unlikely. While diuretics can affect urea levels, triamterene's primary action is on potassium retention, and there is no strong evidence to suggest it significantly decreases urea levels, making option 'opc' (Decrease in urea level) less likely. The retrieved evidence supports the association of triamterene with potassium retention and potential hyperkalemia, aligning with the consensus that muscle cramps can occur due to electrolyte imbalances.\"\n}\n```",
