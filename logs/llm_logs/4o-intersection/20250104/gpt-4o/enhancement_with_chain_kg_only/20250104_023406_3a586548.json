      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Physiology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Digestion of disaccharides occurs at ?\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Mouth\nopb. Stomach\nopc. Small intestine\nopd. Large intestine\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Disaccharides\" -> \"reach small intestine\" -> \"enzymes like sucrase, lactase\" -> \"disaccharides broken down\" -> \"monosaccharides absorbed\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Disaccharides\" -> \"enter mouth\" -> \"no significant digestion\" -> \"pass to stomach\" -> \"no significant digestion\" -> \"reach small intestine\" -> \"enzymes like sucrase, lactase\" -> \"disaccharides broken down\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Disaccharides\" -> \"enter stomach\" -> \"acidic environment\" -> \"no significant digestion\" -> \"pass to small intestine\" -> \"enzymes like sucrase, lactase\" -> \"disaccharides broken down\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Disaccharides\" -> \"reach large intestine\" -> \"bacterial fermentation possible\" -> \"not primary site of digestion\" -> 50%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Disaccharides)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Lipopolysaccharides)-PART_OF->(Intestines)\n(Disaccharides)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Lipids)-PART_OF->(Intestines)\n(Disaccharides)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Lipopolysaccharides)-PART_OF->(Stomach)\n(Disaccharides)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Lipids)-PART_OF->(Stomach)\n(SUCRASE)-CAUSES->(Enzyme Inhibition)-PROCESS_OF->(Brain)-LOCATION_OF->(Disaccharides)\n(Enzymes)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Disaccharides)\n(Disaccharides)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Monosaccharides)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"The digestion of disaccharides primarily occurs in the small intestine. Disaccharides such as sucrose and lactose are broken down by specific enzymes like sucrase and lactase into monosaccharides, which are then absorbed. In the mouth and stomach, there is no significant digestion of disaccharides due to the lack of specific enzymes. The large intestine is not a primary site for disaccharide digestion, although some bacterial fermentation can occur there. The evidence paths indicating interactions with lipopolysaccharides and lipids in the intestines and stomach are too broad and do not directly address disaccharide digestion. The consensus supports the small intestine as the main site for disaccharide digestion.\"\n}\n```",
