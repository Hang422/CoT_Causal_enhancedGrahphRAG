      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        The patient is being administered i.v. quinine following which he developed restlessness and sweating, the most likely cause is :\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Hypoglycemia\nopb. Cinchonism\nopc. Arrhythmias\nopd. Sweating\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"i.v. quinine\" -> \"increased insulin secretion\" -> \"decreased blood glucose\" -> \"hypoglycemia\" -> \"restlessness and sweating\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"i.v. quinine\" -> \"cinchonism\" -> \"tinnitus, headache, dizziness\" -> \"restlessness\" -> 60%\nCHAIN: \"i.v. quinine\" -> \"cardiac effects\" -> \"arrhythmias\" -> \"restlessness and sweating\" -> 50%\nCHAIN: \"i.v. quinine\" -> \"direct stimulation of sweat glands\" -> \"sweating\" -> \"restlessness\" -> 40%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(hypoglycemia)-CAUSES->(Agitation)\n(cardiac arrhythmia)-CAUSES/COMPLICATES->(Disease)-CAUSES->(Agitation)\n(Headache)-MANIFESTATION_OF/PREDISPOSES->(Disease)-CAUSES->(Agitation)\n(Dizziness)-ASSOCIATED_WITH/PREDISPOSES->(Disease)-CAUSES->(Agitation)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"The most likely cause of restlessness and sweating following i.v. quinine administration is hypoglycemia. Quinine can increase insulin secretion, leading to decreased blood glucose levels, which is a well-documented cause of hypoglycemia. Hypoglycemia is known to cause symptoms such as restlessness and sweating, aligning with the patient's presentation. The evidence path supports this by linking hypoglycemia to agitation, which can manifest as restlessness. While cinchonism, arrhythmias, and direct stimulation of sweat glands are potential effects of quinine, they are less likely to explain the combination of restlessness and sweating in this context. Cinchonism typically presents with tinnitus, headache, and dizziness, and arrhythmias are more associated with cardiac symptoms. Therefore, hypoglycemia is the most plausible explanation based on the consensus and evidence.\"\n}\n```",
