      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Physiology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Shock causes:\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Stagnant hypoxia\nopb. Anemic hypoxia\nopc. Hypoxic hypoxia\nopd. Histotoxic hypoxia\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Shock\" -> \"decreased blood flow\" -> \"reduced oxygen delivery to tissues\" -> \"stagnant hypoxia\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Shock\" -> \"blood loss\" -> \"reduced hemoglobin\" -> \"anemic hypoxia\" -> 70%\nCHAIN: \"Shock\" -> \"impaired oxygen delivery\" -> \"tissue oxygen deficiency\" -> \"hypoxic hypoxia\" -> 80%\nCHAIN: \"Shock\" -> \"normal oxygen delivery\" -> \"cellular inability to utilize oxygen\" -> \"histotoxic hypoxia\" -> 60%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Body tissue)-LOCATION_OF->(Hypoxia)\n(Shock)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Hemorrhage)\n(Oxygen)-ASSOCIATED_WITH/COMPLICATES->(Hypoxia)\n(Shock)-COMPLICATES/MANIFESTATION_OF->(Disease)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Blood Circulation)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Shock primarily leads to stagnant hypoxia due to decreased blood flow and reduced oxygen delivery to tissues, which aligns with the consensus that shock results in impaired circulation. This is supported by the evidence path indicating that shock complicates blood circulation, leading to hypoxia. Anemic hypoxia can occur in shock due to blood loss and reduced hemoglobin levels, but it is less directly associated with shock compared to stagnant hypoxia. Hypoxic hypoxia, characterized by impaired oxygen delivery, is a broader category that can include stagnant hypoxia but is not specific to shock. Histotoxic hypoxia, where cells cannot utilize oxygen despite normal delivery, is not typically caused by shock, as shock primarily affects circulation rather than cellular oxygen utilization. Therefore, stagnant hypoxia is the most directly related to shock.\"\n}\n```",
