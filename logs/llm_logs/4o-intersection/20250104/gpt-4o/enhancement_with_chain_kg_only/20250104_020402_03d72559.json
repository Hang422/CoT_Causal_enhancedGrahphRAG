      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        The following drugs have significant drug interactions with digoxin except:\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Cholestyramine\nopb. Thiazide diuretics\nopc. Quinidine\nopd. Amlodipine\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Cholestyramine\" -> \"binds to digoxin in the gut\" -> \"decreased absorption of digoxin\" -> \"significant drug interaction\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Thiazide diuretics\" -> \"decreased potassium levels\" -> \"increased digoxin toxicity risk\" -> \"significant drug interaction\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Quinidine\" -> \"inhibits P-glycoprotein\" -> \"increased digoxin levels\" -> \"significant drug interaction\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Amlodipine\" -> \"calcium channel blocker\" -> \"no significant effect on digoxin levels\" -> \"no significant drug interaction\" -> 90%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Digoxin)-INTERACTS_WITH/ISA->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-CAUSES->(Adverse drug interaction)\n(Cholestyramine)-ISA->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Digoxin)\n(Cholestyramine)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Enzymes)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Digoxin)\n(Quinidine)-INTERACTS_WITH/ISA->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(P-Glycoproteins)-Glycoproteins)\n(Amlodipine)-ISA->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Calcium Channel Blockers)\n(Gastrointestinal tract structure)-LOCATION_OF->(Placebos)-ISA->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Digoxin)\n(Calcium Channel Blockers)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Digoxin)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Cholestyramine binds to digoxin in the gut, leading to decreased absorption and a significant drug interaction. Thiazide diuretics can cause hypokalemia, increasing the risk of digoxin toxicity, thus representing a significant drug interaction. Quinidine inhibits P-glycoprotein, resulting in increased digoxin levels and a significant drug interaction. Amlodipine, a calcium channel blocker, does not significantly affect digoxin levels, and therefore, does not have a significant drug interaction with digoxin. The evidence paths confirm the interactions of cholestyramine and quinidine with digoxin, while the interaction of calcium channel blockers with digoxin is not significant in the case of amlodipine. Therefore, the correct answer is that amlodipine does not have a significant drug interaction with digoxin.\"\n}\n```",
