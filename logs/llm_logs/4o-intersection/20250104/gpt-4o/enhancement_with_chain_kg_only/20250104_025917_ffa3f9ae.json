      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Biochemistry.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Cardiomyopathy is/are due to deficinency of:\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Selenium\nopb. Phosphorus\nopc. Boron\nopd. Zinc\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Selenium deficiency\" -> \"oxidative stress\" -> \"cardiomyopathy\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Phosphorus deficiency\" -> \"possible muscle weakness\" -> \"unclear link to cardiomyopathy\" -> 40%\nCHAIN: \"Boron deficiency\" -> \"unclear physiological impact\" -> \"unclear link to cardiomyopathy\" -> 30%\nCHAIN: \"Zinc deficiency\" -> \"immune dysfunction\" -> \"possible indirect cardiac effects\" -> 50%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Paresis)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Virus)-CAUSES->(Cardiomyopathies)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Selenium deficiency is well-documented to cause oxidative stress, which can lead to cardiomyopathy. This aligns with the consensus that selenium is crucial for antioxidant defense, and its deficiency can directly impact heart muscle function. Phosphorus deficiency is primarily associated with muscle weakness but lacks a direct link to cardiomyopathy. Boron deficiency has unclear physiological impacts and no established connection to cardiomyopathy. Zinc deficiency can lead to immune dysfunction, which might indirectly affect cardiac health, but it is not a primary cause of cardiomyopathy. The retrieved evidence path involving paresis and viruses does not directly relate to nutrient deficiencies causing cardiomyopathy and is therefore not relevant to this question. Based on consensus, selenium deficiency is the most directly linked to cardiomyopathy.\"\n}\n```",
