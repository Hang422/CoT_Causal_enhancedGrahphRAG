      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Physiology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        The Efferent fibers bundle of the substantia nigra transmits dopamine to one of the following areas\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Thalamus\nopb. Corpus striatum\nopc. Tegmentum of pons\nopd. Tectum of midbrain\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Substantia nigra\" -> \"dopamine production\" -> \"transmission to corpus striatum\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Substantia nigra\" -> \"dopamine production\" -> \"transmission to thalamus\" -> \"possible\" -> 60%\nCHAIN: \"Substantia nigra\" -> \"dopamine production\" -> \"transmission to tegmentum of pons\" -> \"unclear\" -> 50%\nCHAIN: \"Substantia nigra\" -> \"dopamine production\" -> \"transmission to tectum of midbrain\" -> \"unlikely\" -> 40%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Substantia nigra structure)-PART_OF->(Brain)-LOCATION_OF->(Dopamine)\n(Dopamine)-INTERACTS_WITH/PART_OF->(Cells)-PART_OF->(Thalamic structure)\n(Dopamine)-INTERACTS_WITH/PART_OF->(Cells)-PART_OF->(Tegmentum Mesencephali)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"The substantia nigra is a critical structure in the brain involved in the production of dopamine, a neurotransmitter essential for motor control. The primary efferent fibers of the substantia nigra project to the corpus striatum, which is part of the basal ganglia. This pathway, known as the nigrostriatal pathway, is well-established and plays a significant role in the regulation of movement. While dopamine can interact with various brain regions, the direct and primary transmission from the substantia nigra is to the corpus striatum. Other potential pathways, such as to the thalamus, tegmentum of pons, or tectum of midbrain, are either less direct or not primarily associated with the substantia nigra's efferent fibers. Therefore, the most consensus-aligned answer is that the efferent fibers of the substantia nigra transmit dopamine to the corpus striatum.\"\n}\n```",
