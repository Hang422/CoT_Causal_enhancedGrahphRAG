      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Biochemistry.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Which of the following is the source of energy for a cardiac muscle at normal conditions?\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Fatty acids\nopb. Ketone bodies\nopc. Glucose\nopd. Any of the above\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Fatty acids\" -> \"beta-oxidation\" -> \"ATP production\" -> \"primary energy source\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Ketone bodies\" -> \"oxidation\" -> \"ATP production\" -> \"secondary energy source\" -> 70%\nCHAIN: \"Glucose\" -> \"glycolysis\" -> \"ATP production\" -> \"lesser energy source\" -> 60%\nCHAIN: \"Any of the above\" -> \"metabolized\" -> \"ATP production\" -> \"energy source\" -> 80%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Oxidation)-CAUSES->(Disease)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(uptake)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Adenosine Triphosphate)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"In normal conditions, the primary source of energy for cardiac muscle is fatty acids. Fatty acids undergo beta-oxidation, leading to ATP production, which is the main energy source for the heart, accounting for approximately 60-70% of its energy needs. Ketone bodies can also be oxidized to produce ATP, serving as a secondary energy source, especially during fasting or low-carbohydrate intake. Glucose is utilized through glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation, providing a lesser but significant portion of energy, particularly under conditions of increased workload or hypoxia. The option 'Any of the above' is technically correct as the heart can metabolize all these substrates for energy, but under normal conditions, fatty acids are predominant. The retrieved evidence path broadly supports the role of oxidation in ATP production, which is relevant to all these substrates but does not specify the primary source under normal conditions.\"\n}\n```",
