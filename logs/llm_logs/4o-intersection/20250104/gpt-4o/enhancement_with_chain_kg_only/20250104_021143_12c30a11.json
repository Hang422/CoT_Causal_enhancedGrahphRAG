      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Biochemistry.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Glycogen storage diseases include all the following except:\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Krabbe's disease\nopb. Fabry's disease\nopc. Fragile syndrome\nopd. All\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Glycogen storage diseases\" -> \"involve glycogen metabolism\" -> \"Krabbe's disease\" -> \"not related to glycogen\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Glycogen storage diseases\" -> \"involve glycogen metabolism\" -> \"Fabry's disease\" -> \"not related to glycogen\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Glycogen storage diseases\" -> \"involve glycogen metabolism\" -> \"Fragile syndrome\" -> \"not related to glycogen\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Glycogen storage diseases\" -> \"involve glycogen metabolism\" -> \"Krabbe's disease\" -> \"Fabry's disease\" -> \"Fragile syndrome\" -> \"none related to glycogen\" -> \"all options incorrect\" -> 90%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Globoid cell leukodystrophy)-CAUSES/ISA->(Disease)-CAUSES/MANIFESTATION_OF->(Fabry Disease)\n(Fabry Disease)-CAUSES/PREDISPOSES->(Disease)-CAUSES->(Fragile X Syndrome)\n(Globoid cell leukodystrophy)-CAUSES/ISA->(Disease)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Streptococcus pneumoniae)-LOCATION_OF->(Glycogen)\n(Fabry Disease)-PREDISPOSES->(Pathogenesis)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Enzymes)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Glycogen)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Glycogen storage diseases are a group of metabolic disorders that specifically involve the metabolism of glycogen. Krabbe's disease, Fabry's disease, and Fragile X syndrome are not related to glycogen metabolism. Krabbe's disease is a lysosomal storage disorder affecting the nervous system, Fabry's disease is a lysosomal storage disorder affecting lipid metabolism, and Fragile X syndrome is a genetic disorder affecting intellectual development. The retrieved evidence paths, while correct in their associations, do not directly relate these diseases to glycogen metabolism. Therefore, none of the options (Krabbe's disease, Fabry's disease, Fragile X syndrome) are glycogen storage diseases, making 'All' the correct choice for the exception.\"\n}\n```",
