      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Drugs causing hypokalemia are : a) Amphotericin B b) Insulin c) Cyclosporine d) Carbenoxolone e) NSAIDs\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. ace\nopb. ac\nopc. abd\nopd. acd\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Amphotericin B\" -> \"renal tubular damage\" -> \"increased potassium excretion\" -> \"hypokalemia\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Insulin\" -> \"cellular uptake of potassium\" -> \"decreased serum potassium\" -> \"hypokalemia\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Cyclosporine\" -> \"possible renal effects\" -> \"unclear impact on potassium\" -> 50%\nCHAIN: \"Carbenoxolone\" -> \"mineralocorticoid activity\" -> \"increased potassium excretion\" -> \"hypokalemia\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"NSAIDs\" -> \"renal effects\" -> \"possible potassium retention\" -> \"unclear impact on hypokalemia\" -> 40%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Insulin)-CAUSES->(Excretory function)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(potassium)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Amphotericin B is known to cause hypokalemia due to renal tubular damage leading to increased potassium excretion. Insulin can cause hypokalemia by promoting cellular uptake of potassium, thereby decreasing serum potassium levels. Carbenoxolone, through its mineralocorticoid activity, can also lead to hypokalemia by increasing potassium excretion. Cyclosporine's impact on potassium levels is unclear and not typically associated with hypokalemia. NSAIDs are more commonly associated with potassium retention rather than hypokalemia. Therefore, the drugs most consistently associated with causing hypokalemia are Amphotericin B, Insulin, and Carbenoxolone, supporting option 'opd. acd'.\"\n}\n```",
