      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        The following statements regarding insulin resistance in diabetic patients are true except:\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. It is more common with huminsulin\nopb. It may occur in the presence of infections\nopc. It may be due to antibodies to insulin\nopd. Use of glucocorticoids may be useful in severe cases\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Huminsulin\" -> \"common insulin type\" -> \"no increased resistance\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Infection\" -> \"inflammatory response\" -> \"increased insulin resistance\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Antibodies to insulin\" -> \"bind to insulin\" -> \"reduced insulin effectiveness\" -> \"increased insulin resistance\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Glucocorticoids\" -> \"increased blood glucose\" -> \"worsened insulin resistance\" -> 95%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Inflammatory Response)-CAUSES/COMPLICATES->(Insulin Resistance)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"In evaluating insulin resistance in diabetic patients, the following insights are aligned with medical consensus: (opa) Insulin resistance is not more common with 'huminsulin' as it is a standard insulin type without increased resistance risk. (opb) Infections can lead to an inflammatory response, which is known to increase insulin resistance, supported by evidence linking inflammation to insulin resistance. (opc) The presence of antibodies to insulin can bind to insulin, reducing its effectiveness and thereby increasing insulin resistance. (opd) The use of glucocorticoids is not advisable in managing insulin resistance as they typically increase blood glucose levels and worsen insulin resistance. Therefore, the statement that glucocorticoids may be useful in severe cases is incorrect.\"\n}\n```",
