      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Drug of choice for Treponema Pallidum is?\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Penicillin G\nopb. Tetracycline\nopc. Azithromycin\nopd. Doxycycline\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Treponema Pallidum\" -> \"causes syphilis\" -> \"Penicillin G effective against syphilis\" -> \"Penicillin G is drug of choice\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Treponema Pallidum\" -> \"causes syphilis\" -> \"Tetracycline alternative treatment\" -> \"less effective than Penicillin G\" -> 70%\nCHAIN: \"Treponema Pallidum\" -> \"causes syphilis\" -> \"Azithromycin sometimes used\" -> \"resistance concerns\" -> \"not first-line treatment\" -> 60%\nCHAIN: \"Treponema Pallidum\" -> \"causes syphilis\" -> \"Doxycycline alternative treatment\" -> \"used in penicillin allergy\" -> \"less effective than Penicillin G\" -> 75%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Syphilis)-ASSOCIATED_WITH/PROCESS_OF->(Bacteria)-LOCATION_OF->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Treponema pallidum is the bacterium that causes syphilis. The standard medical consensus is that Penicillin G is the drug of choice for treating syphilis due to its high efficacy and established use. Tetracycline and Doxycycline are considered alternative treatments, primarily used when a patient has a penicillin allergy, but they are less effective than Penicillin G. Azithromycin has been used in some cases, but concerns about resistance make it not a first-line treatment. The retrieved evidence path broadly associates syphilis with bacterial infections and pharmaceutical preparations, which supports the context of using antibiotics like Penicillin G for treatment. Therefore, Penicillin G remains the preferred treatment option for syphilis.\"\n}\n```",
