      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Warfarin induced skin necrosis is seen in ?\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Protein C deficiency\nopb. Protein S deficiency\nopc. Hemophillia\nopd. Antithrombin III deficiency\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Warfarin administration\" -> \"reduced Protein C activity\" -> \"hypercoagulable state\" -> \"skin necrosis\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Warfarin administration\" -> \"reduced Protein S activity\" -> \"possible hypercoagulable state\" -> \"possible skin necrosis\" -> 60%\nCHAIN: \"Warfarin administration\" -> \"no effect on hemophilia\" -> \"no skin necrosis\" -> 10%\nCHAIN: \"Warfarin administration\" -> \"no significant effect on Antithrombin III\" -> \"no skin necrosis\" -> 10%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Antithrombin III)-TREATS->(Infection)-CAUSES->(Skin necrosis)\n(Thrombophilia)-CAUSES->(Skin necrosis)\n(Protein C)-CAUSES->(Symptoms)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Thrombophilia)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Warfarin-induced skin necrosis is most commonly associated with Protein C deficiency. Warfarin administration leads to a rapid reduction in Protein C activity, which is a natural anticoagulant, resulting in a temporary hypercoagulable state. This can cause skin necrosis, particularly in individuals with an underlying Protein C deficiency. The reasoning chain for Protein C deficiency aligns with standard medical consensus and is supported by the evidence path indicating that Protein C deficiency can manifest as thrombophilia, which can lead to skin necrosis. While Protein S deficiency could theoretically contribute to a hypercoagulable state, it is less commonly associated with warfarin-induced skin necrosis. Hemophilia and Antithrombin III deficiency do not typically lead to skin necrosis in the context of warfarin administration, as warfarin does not significantly affect these conditions in a way that would cause such a complication.\"\n}\n```",
