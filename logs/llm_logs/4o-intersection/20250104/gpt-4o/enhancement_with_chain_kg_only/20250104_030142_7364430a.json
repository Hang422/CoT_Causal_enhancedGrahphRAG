      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Biochemistry.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Essential amino acids are all except:\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Leucine\nopb. Lysine\nopc. Methionine\nopd. Proline\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Leucine\" -> \"essential amino acid\" -> \"required for protein synthesis\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Lysine\" -> \"essential amino acid\" -> \"important for growth and tissue repair\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Methionine\" -> \"essential amino acid\" -> \"involved in methylation processes\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Proline\" -> \"non-essential amino acid\" -> \"synthesized by the body\" -> 95%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Leucine)-INTERACTS_WITH->(T-Lymphocyte)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Amino Acids)\n(Leucine)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cells)-LOCATION_OF->(Amino Acids)\n(Lysine)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cells)-INTERACTS_WITH/LOCATION_OF->(Amino Acids)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Essential amino acids are those that cannot be synthesized by the human body and must be obtained from the diet. Leucine, lysine, and methionine are all essential amino acids, as they are required for protein synthesis, growth, tissue repair, and various metabolic processes, including methylation. Proline, on the other hand, is a non-essential amino acid because the body can synthesize it. The retrieved evidence paths, while broad, confirm the interaction of leucine and lysine with cellular processes, supporting their roles as essential amino acids. Therefore, the correct answer is that proline is not an essential amino acid.\"\n}\n```",
