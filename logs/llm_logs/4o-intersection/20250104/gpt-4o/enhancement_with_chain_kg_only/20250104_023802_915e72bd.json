      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Physiology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Which is not secreted by stomach?\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Lipase\nopb. Pepsinogens\nopc. HCI\nopd. None\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Stomach\" -> \"secretes pepsinogens\" -> \"pepsinogens convert to pepsin\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Stomach\" -> \"secretes HCl\" -> \"acidic environment\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Stomach\" -> \"secretes gastric lipase\" -> \"lipid digestion\" -> 80%\nCHAIN: \"Lipase\" -> \"primarily secreted by pancreas\" -> \"not main secretion of stomach\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"None\" -> \"all options secreted by stomach\" -> \"incorrect\" -> 70%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Lipase)-PART_OF->(Pancreas)\n(Stomach)-LOCATION_OF->(Hypertrophy)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Pepsinogens)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"The stomach secretes pepsinogens and hydrochloric acid (HCl), which are essential for protein digestion and creating an acidic environment, respectively. While the stomach does secrete gastric lipase, the primary source of lipase is the pancreas, which is responsible for the majority of lipid digestion. Therefore, lipase is not primarily secreted by the stomach. The evidence path indicating lipase as part of the pancreas supports this consensus. Thus, the correct answer is that lipase is not secreted by the stomach as its main function.\"\n}\n```",
