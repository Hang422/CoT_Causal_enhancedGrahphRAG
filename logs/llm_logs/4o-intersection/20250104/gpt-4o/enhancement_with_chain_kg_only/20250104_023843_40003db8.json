      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Anticoagulant of choice for prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism in patient with cancer surgery is:-\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Heparin sulfate\nopb. Protamine sulfate\nopc. Low molecular weight heparin\nopd. Warfarin\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Cancer surgery\" -> \"increased risk of venous thromboembolism\" -> \"need for anticoagulation\" -> \"Low molecular weight heparin\" -> \"effective prophylaxis\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Cancer surgery\" -> \"increased risk of venous thromboembolism\" -> \"need for anticoagulation\" -> \"Heparin sulfate\" -> \"effective but less convenient than LMWH\" -> 70%\nCHAIN: \"Cancer surgery\" -> \"increased risk of venous thromboembolism\" -> \"need for anticoagulation\" -> \"Warfarin\" -> \"requires monitoring, not ideal for immediate prophylaxis\" -> 50%\nCHAIN: \"Cancer surgery\" -> \"increased risk of venous thromboembolism\" -> \"need for anticoagulation\" -> \"Protamine sulfate\" -> \"not an anticoagulant, used to reverse heparin\" -> 10%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Protamine Sulfate)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cells)-INTERACTS_WITH/LOCATION_OF->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Anticoagulants)\n(anticoagulation)-CAUSES/PREVENTS->(Disease)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Antiinflammatory Effect)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Protamine Sulfate)\n(anticoagulation)-CAUSES/PREVENTS->(Thrombosis)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Warfarin)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"For prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism in patients undergoing cancer surgery, the standard consensus is to use Low Molecular Weight Heparin (LMWH) due to its effectiveness and convenience. LMWH is preferred over unfractionated heparin (Heparin sulfate) because it requires less frequent dosing and monitoring. Warfarin is not ideal for immediate prophylaxis due to its need for monitoring and delayed onset of action. Protamine sulfate is not an anticoagulant; it is used to reverse the effects of heparin, making it irrelevant for prophylaxis. The evidence paths confirm the association of anticoagulation with preventing thrombosis, supporting the use of anticoagulants like LMWH in this context.\"\n}\n```",
