      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Physiology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Which of the following is the best-known metabolic function of the lung\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Inactivation of serotonin\nopb. Conversion of angiotensin–I to angiotensin–II\nopc. Inactivation of bradykinin\nopd. Metabolism of basic drugs by cytochrome P–450 system\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Lung\" -> \"presence of ACE\" -> \"conversion of angiotensin-I to angiotensin-II\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Lung\" -> \"inactivation of serotonin\" -> \"reduced serotonin levels\" -> 60%\nCHAIN: \"Lung\" -> \"inactivation of bradykinin\" -> \"reduced bradykinin activity\" -> 70%\nCHAIN: \"Lung\" -> \"cytochrome P-450 system\" -> \"metabolism of basic drugs\" -> \"possible\" -> 50%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Lung)-LOCATION_OF->(Bradykinin)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"The best-known metabolic function of the lung is the conversion of angiotensin-I to angiotensin-II. This process is facilitated by the presence of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) in the lungs, which is a well-established physiological role. While the lung can inactivate substances like serotonin and bradykinin, these functions are not as prominently recognized as the conversion of angiotensin-I to angiotensin-II. The metabolism of basic drugs by the cytochrome P-450 system is primarily a function of the liver, not the lung. Therefore, the conversion of angiotensin-I to angiotensin-II is the most significant and well-documented metabolic function of the lung.\"\n}\n```",
