      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Physiology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        The placenta secretes a hormone that is utilized in the early detection of pregnancy. This hormone is:\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Endothelial growth factor (EGF)\nopb. Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG)\nopc. Human chorionic somatotropin (HCS)\nopd. Relaxin\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Placenta\" -> \"secretes hormone\" -> \"hCG\" -> \"early detection of pregnancy\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Placenta\" -> \"secretes hormone\" -> \"hCG\" -> \"detected in urine\" -> \"pregnancy test\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Placenta\" -> \"secretes hormone\" -> \"hCG\" -> \"detected in blood\" -> \"early pregnancy confirmation\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Placenta\" -> \"secretes hormone\" -> \"hCG\" -> \"rises in early pregnancy\" -> \"used in pregnancy tests\" -> 95%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Human Chorionic Gonadotropin)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cells)-LOCATION_OF->(Early Diagnosis)\n(Human Chorionic Gonadotropin)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cultured Cells)-LOCATION_OF->(Early Diagnosis)\n(Human Chorionic Gonadotropin)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(early pregnancy)\n(Human Chorionic Gonadotropin)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cells)-PART_OF->(Blood)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"The hormone secreted by the placenta that is utilized in the early detection of pregnancy is human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). This is supported by the consensus that hCG is produced by the placenta shortly after implantation and is detectable in both blood and urine, making it a reliable marker for early pregnancy tests. The retrieved evidence paths confirm that hCG is associated with early pregnancy and interacts with cells in a way that facilitates its detection in diagnostic tests. Other hormones like endothelial growth factor (EGF), human chorionic somatotropin (HCS), and relaxin are not used for early pregnancy detection.\"\n}\n```",
