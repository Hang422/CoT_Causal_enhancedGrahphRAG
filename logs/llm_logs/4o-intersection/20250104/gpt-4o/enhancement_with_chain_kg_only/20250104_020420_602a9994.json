      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Propronolol is useful in all except -\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Atrial flutter\nopb. Parkinsonian tremor\nopc. Thyrotoxicosis\nopd. HOCM\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Propranolol\" -> \"beta-blocker\" -> \"decreases heart rate\" -> \"controls atrial flutter\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Propranolol\" -> \"beta-blocker\" -> \"reduces tremor\" -> \"possible effect on Parkinsonian tremor\" -> 60%\nCHAIN: \"Propranolol\" -> \"beta-blocker\" -> \"reduces sympathetic activity\" -> \"controls symptoms of thyrotoxicosis\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Propranolol\" -> \"beta-blocker\" -> \"reduces heart rate\" -> \"may worsen outflow obstruction in HOCM\" -> 85%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Tremor)-CAUSES->(Parkinsonian tremor)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Propranolol, a non-selective beta-blocker, is effective in managing atrial flutter by decreasing heart rate and controlling arrhythmias, aligning with standard medical consensus. It is also beneficial in thyrotoxicosis by reducing sympathetic overactivity, which helps control symptoms. However, propranolol is not typically used for Parkinsonian tremor, as it is more effective for essential tremor, and its role in Parkinson's disease is limited and not well-supported by evidence. In hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM), propranolol can potentially worsen outflow obstruction due to its negative inotropic effects, making it less suitable for this condition. Therefore, propranolol is useful in all except Parkinsonian tremor, where its efficacy is not established.\"\n}\n```",
