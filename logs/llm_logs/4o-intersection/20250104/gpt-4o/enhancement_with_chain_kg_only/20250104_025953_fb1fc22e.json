      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Drug of choice for peptic ulcer disease caused by chronic use of NSAIDS:\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Pirenzepine\nopb. Loratadine\nopc. Misoprostol\nopd. Esomeprazole\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Misoprostol\" -> \"increased prostaglandin production\" -> \"enhanced gastric mucosal protection\" -> \"reduced NSAID-induced gastric damage\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Esomeprazole\" -> \"reduced gastric acid secretion\" -> \"decreased gastric acidity\" -> \"promoted ulcer healing\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Pirenzepine\" -> \"reduced gastric acid secretion\" -> \"possible ulcer healing\" -> 60%\nCHAIN: \"Loratadine\" -> \"antihistamine effect\" -> \"no direct effect on gastric mucosa\" -> \"unlikely to treat peptic ulcer\" -> 20%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Misoprostol)-ISA->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Prostaglandins)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"For peptic ulcer disease caused by chronic NSAID use, the drug of choice is Misoprostol. Misoprostol is a prostaglandin analog that increases prostaglandin production, enhancing gastric mucosal protection and reducing NSAID-induced gastric damage. This aligns with the evidence path showing Misoprostol's interaction with prostaglandins, confirming its role in protecting the gastric lining. Esomeprazole, a proton pump inhibitor, reduces gastric acid secretion and promotes ulcer healing, making it a secondary option. Pirenzepine, an anticholinergic, has a less direct effect on ulcer healing due to its weaker acid secretion reduction. Loratadine, an antihistamine, has no direct effect on gastric mucosa and is not suitable for treating peptic ulcers. Therefore, Misoprostol is the most appropriate choice based on its mechanism and evidence support.\"\n}\n```",
