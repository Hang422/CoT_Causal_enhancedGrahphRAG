      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        All of the following side effects are produced by Cisplatin except\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Ototoxicity\nopb. Nephrotoxicity\nopc. Coasting effect\nopd. Pulmonary fibrosis\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Cisplatin\" -> \"ototoxicity\" -> \"hearing loss\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Cisplatin\" -> \"nephrotoxicity\" -> \"kidney damage\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Cisplatin\" -> \"coasting effect\" -> \"delayed neuropathy\" -> 70%\nCHAIN: \"Cisplatin\" -> \"pulmonary fibrosis\" -> \"unclear association\" -> 60%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Cisplatin)-CAUSES/PREVENTS->(Ototoxicity)\n(Cisplatin)-CAUSES/PREVENTS->(Toxic nephropathy)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Cisplatin is well-documented to cause ototoxicity, leading to hearing loss, and nephrotoxicity, resulting in kidney damage, both of which are supported by standard medical consensus and the retrieved evidence paths. The 'coasting effect' refers to a delayed neuropathy that can occur with some chemotherapeutic agents, including cisplatin, but it is less commonly discussed and not as strongly associated as the other side effects. Pulmonary fibrosis is not a recognized side effect of cisplatin, and there is no strong evidence or consensus linking cisplatin to this condition. Therefore, the side effect not produced by cisplatin is pulmonary fibrosis.\"\n}\n```",
