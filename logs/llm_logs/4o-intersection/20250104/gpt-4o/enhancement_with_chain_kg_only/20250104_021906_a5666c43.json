      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Aldosterone action is on :\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Proximal tubule\nopb. Distal tubules\nopc. Loop of Henle\nopd. Collecting duct\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Aldosterone\" -> \"sodium reabsorption\" -> \"distal tubules\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Aldosterone\" -> \"sodium reabsorption\" -> \"collecting duct\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Aldosterone\" -> \"potassium excretion\" -> \"distal tubules\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Aldosterone\" -> \"water retention\" -> \"collecting duct\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Aldosterone\" -> \"sodium reabsorption\" -> \"proximal tubule\" -> possible -> 60%\nCHAIN: \"Aldosterone\" -> \"sodium reabsorption\" -> \"loop of Henle\" -> possible -> 60%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Aldosterone)-CAUSES/PREDISPOSES->(Disease)-CAUSES->(Body fluid retention)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Aldosterone primarily acts on the distal tubules and the collecting duct in the kidney. It promotes sodium reabsorption and potassium excretion, which are key functions in these segments. The evidence paths indicating aldosterone's role in body fluid retention align with its action in these areas, as sodium reabsorption leads to water retention. The proximal tubule and loop of Henle are not primary sites of aldosterone action, as consensus indicates its effects are most significant in the distal tubules and collecting duct.\"\n}\n```",
