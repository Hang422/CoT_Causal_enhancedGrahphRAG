      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Most potent mineralocoicoid is\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Aldosterone\nopb. DOCA\nopc. Fludrocoeisone\nopd. Triamcinolone\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Aldosterone\" -> \"strong sodium retention\" -> \"increased blood volume\" -> \"potent mineralocorticoid effect\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"DOCA\" -> \"moderate sodium retention\" -> \"increased blood volume\" -> \"less potent than aldosterone\" -> 70%\nCHAIN: \"Fludrocortisone\" -> \"strong sodium retention\" -> \"increased blood volume\" -> \"potent mineralocorticoid effect\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Triamcinolone\" -> \"minimal mineralocorticoid activity\" -> \"weak sodium retention\" -> \"not potent mineralocorticoid\" -> 60%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Aldosterone)-CAUSES/PREDISPOSES->(Hypernatremia)\n(Desoxycorticosterone acetate)-CAUSES->(Hypernatremia)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Aldosterone is the most potent mineralocorticoid, characterized by its strong sodium retention and significant impact on increasing blood volume, which aligns with its role in causing hypernatremia. Fludrocortisone also exhibits strong sodium retention and mineralocorticoid effects but is less potent than aldosterone. DOCA (Desoxycorticosterone acetate) has moderate sodium retention and is less potent than aldosterone, as supported by its association with hypernatremia. Triamcinolone has minimal mineralocorticoid activity and weak sodium retention, making it the least potent in this context. Therefore, based on consensus and evidence, aldosterone is the most potent mineralocorticoid.\"\n}\n```",
