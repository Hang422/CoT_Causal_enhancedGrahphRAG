      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Biochemistry.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Starvation and diabetes mellitus can lead on to ketoacidosis which of the following features is in our of ketoacidosis due to diabetes mellitus.\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Increase in glucagon/insulin ratio, increased CAMP and increased blood glucose\nopb. Decreased insulin, increased free fatty acid which is equivalent to blood glucose\nopc. Decreased insulin, increased free fatty acid which is not equivalent to blood glucose\nopd. Elevated insulin and free fatty acid, equivalent to blood glucose\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Decreased insulin\" -> \"Increased glucagon/insulin ratio\" -> \"Increased cAMP\" -> \"Increased blood glucose\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Decreased insulin\" -> \"Increased free fatty acid\" -> \"Not equivalent to blood glucose\" -> 80%\nCHAIN: \"Decreased insulin\" -> \"Increased free fatty acid\" -> \"Equivalent to blood glucose\" -> 60%\nCHAIN: \"Elevated insulin\" -> \"Increased free fatty acid\" -> \"Equivalent to blood glucose\" -> 50%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Fatty Acids, Nonesterified)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Blood Glucose)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"In ketoacidosis due to diabetes mellitus, the key feature is a decreased insulin level, leading to an increased glucagon/insulin ratio. This results in increased cAMP levels and elevated blood glucose, as the body shifts to using free fatty acids for energy due to lack of insulin. This aligns with option 'opa', which correctly describes the biochemical changes: increased glucagon/insulin ratio, increased cAMP, and increased blood glucose. The evidence path indicating interaction between nonesterified fatty acids and blood glucose supports the metabolic shift towards fatty acid utilization, but it is not directly equivalent to blood glucose levels. Therefore, options 'opb', 'opc', and 'opd' are incorrect as they either misrepresent the relationship between free fatty acids and blood glucose or incorrectly state insulin levels. The consensus supports that in diabetic ketoacidosis, insulin is decreased, leading to increased free fatty acids and blood glucose, but these are not equivalent in terms of energy provision or metabolic pathways.\"\n}\n```",
