      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Which of the following drugs is useful in prophylaxis of motion sickness?\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Hyoscine\nopb. Metoclopramide\nopc. Prochlorperazine\nopd. Ondansetron\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Hyoscine\" -> \"anticholinergic effect\" -> \"inhibits vestibular system\" -> \"prevents motion sickness\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Metoclopramide\" -> \"dopamine antagonist\" -> \"acts on chemoreceptor trigger zone\" -> \"reduces nausea\" -> \"not specific for motion sickness\" -> 60%\nCHAIN: \"Prochlorperazine\" -> \"dopamine antagonist\" -> \"acts on chemoreceptor trigger zone\" -> \"reduces nausea\" -> \"not specific for motion sickness\" -> 60%\nCHAIN: \"Ondansetron\" -> \"serotonin antagonist\" -> \"acts on chemoreceptor trigger zone\" -> \"reduces nausea\" -> \"not specific for motion sickness\" -> 60%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Metoclopramide)-TREATS->(Epilepsy)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(physiological aspects)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Dopamine Antagonists)\n(Ondansetron)-TREATS->(Disease)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Sleep, Slow-Wave)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Serotonin Antagonists)\n(Ondansetron)-ISA->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Serotonin Uptake Inhibitors)-ISA->(Serotonin Antagonists)\n(Metoclopramide)-TREATS->(Functional disorder)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(physiological aspects)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Dopamine Antagonists)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Hyoscine, also known as scopolamine, is an anticholinergic drug that effectively prevents motion sickness by inhibiting the vestibular system, which aligns with standard medical consensus. Metoclopramide and Prochlorperazine are dopamine antagonists that act on the chemoreceptor trigger zone to reduce nausea but are not specific for motion sickness prophylaxis. Ondansetron is a serotonin antagonist that also acts on the chemoreceptor trigger zone to reduce nausea, but it is not typically used for motion sickness. The retrieved evidence paths confirm the roles of Metoclopramide and Ondansetron as dopamine and serotonin antagonists, respectively, but do not provide specific support for their use in motion sickness prophylaxis. Therefore, Hyoscine is the most appropriate choice for the prophylaxis of motion sickness.\"\n}\n```",
