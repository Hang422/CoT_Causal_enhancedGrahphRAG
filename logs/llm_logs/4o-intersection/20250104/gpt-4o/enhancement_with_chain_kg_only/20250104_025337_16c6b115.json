      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Tocilizumab used against Rheumatoid arthritis is a monoclonal antibody against :\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Interleukin-6\nopb. Interleukin-6 receptor\nopc. Interleukin-5\nopd. Interleukin-5 receptor\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Tocilizumab\" -> \"targets interleukin-6 receptor\" -> \"blocks interleukin-6 signaling\" -> \"reduces inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Tocilizumab\" -> \"monoclonal antibody\" -> \"binds to interleukin-6 receptor\" -> \"prevents interleukin-6 from binding\" -> \"decreases inflammatory response\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Tocilizumab\" -> \"inhibits interleukin-6 receptor\" -> \"modulates immune response\" -> \"alleviates symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis\" -> 92%\nCHAIN: \"Tocilizumab\" -> \"does not target interleukin-5\" -> \"does not target interleukin-5 receptor\" -> \"specific for interleukin-6 receptor\" -> 85%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(tocilizumab)-INTERACTS_WITH->(T-Lymphocyte)-Lymphocyte)->(Interleukin 6 Receptor)\n(tocilizumab)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cells)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Interleukin 6 Receptor)\n(Interleukin 6 Receptor)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Myocardial Infarction)-CAUSES/MANIFESTATION_OF->(Disease)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Immunity)\n(Interleukin 6 Receptor)-INTERACTS_WITH->(T-Lymphocyte)-Lymphocyte)->(Interleukin-6)-6)\n(Interleukin 6 Receptor)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cells)-LOCATION_OF->(Interleukin-6)-6)\n(tocilizumab)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Monoclonal Antibodies)\n(tocilizumab)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cells)-LOCATION_OF->(Monoclonal Antibodies)\n(Monoclonal Antibodies)-INTERACTS_WITH->(T-Lymphocyte)-LOCATION_OF->(Interleukin 6 Receptor)\n(Monoclonal Antibodies)-PART_OF->(Cells)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Interleukin 6 Receptor)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Tocilizumab is a monoclonal antibody that specifically targets the interleukin-6 receptor, not interleukin-6 itself. By binding to the interleukin-6 receptor, it prevents interleukin-6 from interacting with its receptor, thereby blocking the signaling pathway that leads to inflammation. This mechanism helps reduce inflammation and alleviate symptoms in conditions like rheumatoid arthritis. The retrieved evidence paths support this by showing interactions between tocilizumab and the interleukin-6 receptor, confirming its role in modulating immune responses through this receptor. There is no evidence or consensus supporting tocilizumab's interaction with interleukin-5 or its receptor, making options involving interleukin-5 incorrect.\"\n}\n```",
