      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Tamoxifen causes ?\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Osteoporosis\nopb. Endometrial hyperplasia\nopc. Ovarian cancer\nopd. Decreased triglyceride level\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Tamoxifen\" -> \"estrogen receptor modulation\" -> \"endometrial stimulation\" -> \"endometrial hyperplasia\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Tamoxifen\" -> \"estrogen receptor modulation\" -> \"bone density maintenance\" -> \"possible osteoporosis prevention\" -> 60%\nCHAIN: \"Tamoxifen\" -> \"estrogen receptor modulation\" -> \"decreased triglyceride synthesis\" -> \"decreased triglyceride level\" -> 80%\nCHAIN: \"Tamoxifen\" -> \"estrogen receptor modulation\" -> \"ovarian stimulation\" -> \"possible ovarian cancer risk\" -> 50%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Bone Density)-MANIFESTATION_OF/PREDISPOSES->(Osteoporosis)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Tamoxifen is a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) that can cause endometrial hyperplasia due to its partial agonist effect on the endometrium, which is a well-documented side effect. This aligns with the consensus that tamoxifen increases the risk of endometrial changes. While tamoxifen has a complex effect on bone density, it is generally not associated with causing osteoporosis; rather, it may have a protective effect on bone in postmenopausal women. The evidence path related to bone density and osteoporosis is not directly relevant to tamoxifen's effects. Tamoxifen is known to decrease triglyceride levels, which is consistent with its modulation of estrogen receptors affecting lipid metabolism. There is no strong consensus linking tamoxifen to an increased risk of ovarian cancer; thus, this chain is less supported. Therefore, the most consensus-supported effect of tamoxifen is endometrial hyperplasia, with decreased triglyceride levels also being a recognized effect.\"\n}\n```",
