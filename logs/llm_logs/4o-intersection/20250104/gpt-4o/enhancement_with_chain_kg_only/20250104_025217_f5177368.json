      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Biochemistry.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        The function of vitamin A is/are related to which of the following?\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Retinol\nopb. Retinal\nopc. Retinoic acids\nopd. All of the above\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Vitamin A\" -> \"converted to Retinol\" -> \"supports vision and immune function\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Vitamin A\" -> \"converted to Retinal\" -> \"essential for vision\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Vitamin A\" -> \"converted to Retinoic acids\" -> \"regulates gene expression\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Vitamin A\" -> \"Retinol\" -> \"Retinal\" -> \"Retinoic acids\" -> \"all related functions\" -> 95%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Vitamin A)-PART_OF->(Cells)-PART_OF->(Retina)\n(Vitamin A)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cultured Cells)-PART_OF->(Retina)\n(Vitamin A)-PART_OF->(Cells)-LOCATION_OF->(Retinoids)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Vitamin A functions are related to all the listed forms: Retinol, Retinal, and Retinoic acids. Retinol is a form of vitamin A that supports vision and immune function. Retinal is essential for vision, particularly in the conversion of light into signals in the retina. Retinoic acids are involved in regulating gene expression, which is crucial for cell differentiation and growth. The evidence paths confirm that vitamin A and its derivatives are part of cellular processes in the retina, supporting their roles in vision and cellular function. Therefore, the correct answer is that vitamin A is related to all of the above forms.\"\n}\n```",
