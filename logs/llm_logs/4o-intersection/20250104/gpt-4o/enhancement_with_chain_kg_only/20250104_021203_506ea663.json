      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        A 9-year-old boy diagnosed as uncomplicated pulmonary tuberculosis. He is put on isoniazid, rifampin, and ethambutol at home after initial treatment given at hospital. Which is accurate statement for this scenario?\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. His 3-year-old sibling should receive INH prophylaxis\nopb. A baseline test of auditory function test is essential before drug treatment is initiated\nopc. Polyahralgia is a potential adverse effect of the drugs the boy is taking\nopd. His mother, who takes care of him, does not need INH prophylaxis\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"3-year-old sibling\" -> \"close contact with TB patient\" -> \"high risk of TB infection\" -> \"INH prophylaxis recommended\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Isoniazid\" -> \"peripheral neuropathy\" -> \"not auditory function\" -> \"auditory test not essential\" -> 70%\nCHAIN: \"Rifampin\" -> \"polyarthralgia\" -> \"possible adverse effect\" -> 60%\nCHAIN: \"Mother\" -> \"close contact with TB patient\" -> \"risk of TB infection\" -> \"INH prophylaxis recommended\" -> 85%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(isoniazid)-TREATS->(Peripheral Neuropathy)\n(Polyarthralgia)-ISA->(Disease)-CAUSES/PREDISPOSES->(Adverse reactions)\n(Peripheral Neuropathy)-COMPLICATES/MANIFESTATION_OF->(Disease)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Hearing)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Option opa: The 3-year-old sibling of a child with active tuberculosis is considered at high risk for TB infection due to close contact and should receive isoniazid (INH) prophylaxis, aligning with standard TB prevention guidelines. Option opb: Isoniazid is associated with peripheral neuropathy, not auditory issues, so a baseline auditory function test is not essential before starting treatment. Option opc: Polyarthralgia is not a common adverse effect of rifampin; it is more commonly associated with pyrazinamide, which is not part of this regimen. Therefore, this option is incorrect. Option opd: The mother, as a close contact, is at risk of TB infection and should also receive INH prophylaxis, contrary to the statement. Thus, option opa is the most accurate statement for this scenario.\"\n}\n```",
