Anti depressants\nopb. Anti psychotics\nopc. Anti epileptics\nopd. Mood stabilizers\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nSchizophrenia is primarily treated with antipsychotics, which are effective due to their ability to block dopamine receptors, addressing the dopamine dysregulation associated with the disorder. This aligns with the consensus that antipsychotics are the mainstay treatment for managing positive symptoms like hallucinations and delusions, and they may also help with negative and cognitive symptoms. The evidence paths support the interaction of antipsychotic agents with dopamine receptors, confirming their role in symptom control. Antidepressants, antiepileptics, and mood stabilizers are not primary treatments for schizophrenia but may be used adjunctively to manage comorbid conditions or specific symptoms. The retrieved evidence paths broadly support the association of antipsychotic agents with symptom control in schizophrenia, reinforcing their primary role in treatment.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Schizophrenia is a complex psychiatric disorder primarily characterized by positive symptoms such as hallucinations and delusions, as well as negative and cognitive symptoms. The mainstay treatment for schizophrenia is antipsychotic medications, which work by blocking dopamine receptors, particularly the D2 receptor, to address the dopamine dysregulation associated with the disorder. This aligns with the consensus in the medical community that antipsychotics are the primary treatment for managing schizophrenia. While antidepressants, antiepileptics, and mood stabilizers can be used adjunctively to manage specific symptoms or comorbid conditions, they are not the primary treatment for schizophrenia. Therefore, based on standard medical knowledge and the enhanced information provided, antipsychotics are the most likely correct treatment option for schizophrenia.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
