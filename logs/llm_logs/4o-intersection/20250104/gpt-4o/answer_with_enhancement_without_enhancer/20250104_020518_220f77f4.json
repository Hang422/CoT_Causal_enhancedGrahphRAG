Tolazoline\nopb. Clonidine\nopc. Bismuth\nopd. Oxymetazoline\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nTolazoline is a vasodilator that can be used in diagnostic tests for pulmonary hypertension due to its ability to increase blood flow, which aligns with the evidence path showing its role in treating hypertensive conditions through vasodilation. Clonidine, an alpha-2 adrenergic agonist, is used in diagnostic tests for pheochromocytoma due to its effect on reducing sympathetic outflow and blood pressure, which is consistent with standard medical consensus. Bismuth is primarily used for gastrointestinal protection and ulcer treatment, not typically in diagnostic tests, which aligns with the reasoning chain. Oxymetazoline is a vasoconstrictor used for reducing nasal congestion and is not typically used in diagnostic tests, consistent with the reasoning chain. Therefore, Tolazoline is the drug used in the diagnostic test for pulmonary hypertension.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "
