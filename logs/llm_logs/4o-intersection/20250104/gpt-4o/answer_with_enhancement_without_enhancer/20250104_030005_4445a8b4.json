Quinine\nopb. Chloroquine\nopc. Mefloquine\nopd. Atovaquone\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nChloroquine is known to cause retinal pigmentation due to its accumulation in the retinal pigment epithelium, which aligns with standard medical consensus. The retrieved evidence paths, although broad, support the involvement of chloroquine in retinal processes. Quinine has potential retinal toxicity, but its effect on pigmentation is unclear and not well-supported by consensus. Mefloquine and atovaquone have no known effects on retinal pigmentation, consistent with medical consensus. Therefore, chloroquine is the most likely option to cause retinal pigmentation.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Chloroquine is well-documented in medical literature to cause retinal pigmentation due to its accumulation in the retinal pigment epithelium. This is a recognized side effect of long-term use, particularly in the treatment of conditions like rheumatoid arthritis and lupus. Quinine, while having potential retinal toxicity, does not have a well-established link to causing retinal pigmentation. Mefloquine and atovaquone are not associated with retinal pigmentation. Therefore, based on standard medical knowledge and consensus, chloroquine is the most likely cause of retinal pigmentation among the options provided.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
