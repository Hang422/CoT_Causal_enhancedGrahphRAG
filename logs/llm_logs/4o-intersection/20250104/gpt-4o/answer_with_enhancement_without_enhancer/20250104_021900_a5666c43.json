Proximal tubule\nopb. Distal tubules\nopc. Loop of Henle\nopd. Collecting duct\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nAldosterone primarily acts on the distal tubules and the collecting duct of the nephron. It promotes sodium reabsorption and potassium excretion, which are key processes in these segments. The reasoning chains correctly identify the distal tubules and collecting duct as sites of aldosterone action, with the collecting duct being particularly significant for water retention due to its role in regulating water permeability. The proximal tubule and loop of Henle are not primary sites of aldosterone action, as these segments are more involved in other processes such as bulk reabsorption and countercurrent multiplication, respectively. The retrieved evidence paths, while broad, support the role of aldosterone in fluid retention, which aligns with its action in the distal nephron segments. Therefore, the most accurate options are the distal tubules and collecting duct.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

It primarily acts on the distal tubules and the collecting duct of the nephron. In these segments, aldosterone promotes sodium reabsorption and potassium excretion, which are essential for maintaining fluid balance and blood pressure. The proximal tubule and the loop of Henle are not primary sites of aldosterone action; the proximal tubule is mainly involved in bulk reabsorption of solutes and water, while the loop of Henle is key for the countercurrent multiplication mechanism. Therefore, based on standard medical knowledge and the enhanced information provided, the most accurate options for aldosterone action are the distal tubules and the collecting duct.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
