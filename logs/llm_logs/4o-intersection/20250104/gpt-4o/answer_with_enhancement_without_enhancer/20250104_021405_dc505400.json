Imipramine\nopb. Fluvoxamine\nopc. Phenelzine\nopd. Bupropion\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nImipramine is a tricyclic antidepressant known for its anticholinergic effects, which can reduce bladder contractions and thereby decrease nocturnal enuresis. This aligns with the consensus that Imipramine is used in treating nocturnal enuresis due to its ability to affect bladder function. The evidence paths support this by showing Imipramine's interaction with tricyclic antidepressants, which are known to treat bedwetting. In contrast, Fluvoxamine, Phenelzine, and Bupropion do not have direct effects on bladder function and are unlikely to be effective for nocturnal enuresis. Fluvoxamine is an SSRI, Phenelzine is an MAOI, and Bupropion is an NDRI, none of which are typically used for this condition. Therefore, Imipramine is the most appropriate choice for treating nocturnal enuresis among the options provided.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "
