All of the following are true about heparin except-\n\n                    ### Options\n                    opa. Weakest acid found in living things\nopb. Most commercial preparations of heparin now utilize pig intestinal slimes\nopc. Act via Antithrombin activation\nopd. Produce thrombocytopenia\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nHeparin is a commonly used anticoagulant in cardiac surgery. It acts via the activation of Antithrombin, which is a well-established mechanism of action for heparin, confirming option 'opc' as true. Most commercial preparations of heparin are derived from pig intestinal mucosa, supporting option 'opb' as true. Heparin can cause thrombocytopenia as a side effect, aligning with option 'opd' as true. However, the claim that heparin is the 'weakest acid found in living things' is incorrect and not supported by standard biochemical consensus, making option 'opa' the exception. The retrieved evidence paths confirm that heparin is an anticoagulant and can cause thrombocytopenia, but do not support the claim about it being the weakest acid.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Heparin is a widely used anticoagulant in cardiac surgery, primarily acting through the activation of Antithrombin, which is a well-documented mechanism. Most commercial heparin is derived from pig intestinal mucosa, and it is known to potentially cause thrombocytopenia as a side effect. The statement that heparin is the 'weakest acid found in living things' is not supported by any standard biochemical or pharmacological knowledge. Acids in biological systems are typically small molecules like amino acids or nucleic acids, and heparin, being a complex polysaccharide, does not fit this description. Therefore, the claim in option 'opa' is incorrect, making it the exception among the given options.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
