Family of three seven transmembrane protein\nopb. Activated by thrombin\nopc. Releases PGE2\nopd. Protects epithelial cells\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nProtease activated receptors (PARs) are a family of four seven transmembrane proteins, not three, which contradicts option opa. They are indeed activated by thrombin, supporting option opb, as thrombin cleaves the receptor to initiate signal transduction. While PARs can be involved in prostaglandin production, the specific release of PGE2 (prostaglandin E2) is not a well-established function, making option opc less certain. PARs do interact with epithelial cells and can play a role in cellular defense, supporting option opd. The evidence paths confirm interactions with thrombin and epithelial cells, aligning with consensus on activation and protective roles, but do not specifically support PGE2 release, which remains unclear.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "
