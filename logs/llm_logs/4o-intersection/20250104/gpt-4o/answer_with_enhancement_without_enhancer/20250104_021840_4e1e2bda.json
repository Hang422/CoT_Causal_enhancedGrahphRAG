Androgen binding protein\nopb. Testosterone\nopc. LH\nopd. FSH\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nSertoli cells are known to secrete androgen-binding protein (ABP), which binds testosterone to maintain high levels of testosterone in the seminiferous tubules, supporting spermatogenesis. This aligns with the evidence path showing the interaction between Sertoli cells and androgen-binding proteins, as well as their role in testosterone localization. Sertoli cells do not secrete testosterone; instead, testosterone is produced by Leydig cells, as supported by the evidence path indicating testosterone's association with Leydig cells. Sertoli cells respond to FSH, which supports spermatogenesis, but they do not secrete FSH. Similarly, Sertoli cells do not secrete LH; LH acts on Leydig cells to stimulate testosterone production, which is consistent with the evidence path showing LH's interaction with Leydig cells and testosterone. Therefore, the correct answer is that Sertoli cells secrete androgen-binding protein.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Sertoli cells are integral to the process of spermatogenesis within the seminiferous tubules of the testes. They are known to secrete androgen-binding protein (ABP), which plays a crucial role in maintaining high concentrations of testosterone in the seminiferous tubules, thereby facilitating the process of spermatogenesis. Testosterone itself is produced by Leydig cells, not Sertoli cells. Sertoli cells respond to follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), which stimulates their function, but they do not secrete FSH. Similarly, luteinizing hormone (LH) acts on Leydig cells to stimulate testosterone production, not on Sertoli cells. Therefore, based on standard medical knowledge and the enhanced information provided, the most likely correct answer is that Sertoli cells secrete androgen-binding protein.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
