Contraction of gall bladder\nopb. Secretion of pancreatic juice rich in enzymes\nopc. Increases the secretion of enterokinase\nopd. All\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nCholecystokinin (CCK) is a hormone known to stimulate the contraction of the gallbladder, leading to the release of bile, and to stimulate the pancreas to secrete a juice rich in digestive enzymes. These actions are well-supported by physiological consensus. The evidence paths confirm CCK's role in causing fluid secretion and uptake processes in both the gallbladder and pancreas, aligning with its known effects. However, the effect of CCK on enterokinase secretion is not clearly established in standard medical literature, and the retrieved evidence does not provide direct support for this action. Therefore, the most accurate actions of CCK are the contraction of the gallbladder and the secretion of enzyme-rich pancreatic juice, making option 'd. All' incorrect due to the lack of clear evidence for an effect on enterokinase.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Cholecystokinin (CCK) is a well-studied hormone with established roles in the digestive system. It is known to stimulate the contraction of the gallbladder, facilitating the release of bile into the small intestine, and to promote the secretion of pancreatic juice that is rich in digestive enzymes. These actions are well-documented and widely accepted in medical literature. However, the role of CCK in increasing the secretion of enterokinase is not supported by standard physiological knowledge or evidence. Therefore, while options 'opa' and 'opb' are correct, option 'opc' lacks sufficient evidence. Consequently, option 'opd' is incorrect as it includes an unsupported action. The most accurate answer, based on consensus, is that CCK causes contraction of the gallbladder and secretion of enzyme-rich pancreatic juice.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}",
