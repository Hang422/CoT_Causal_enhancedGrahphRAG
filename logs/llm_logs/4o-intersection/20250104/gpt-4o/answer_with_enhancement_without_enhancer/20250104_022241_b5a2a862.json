Duodenum\nopb. Ileum\nopc. Jejunum\nopd. Colon\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nVitamin B12 absorption occurs in the ileum, where it binds to intrinsic factor, a protein secreted by the stomach. This complex travels through the duodenum and jejunum before reaching the ileum, where absorption takes place. The reasoning chains correctly identify the ileum as the site of absorption, consistent with medical consensus. The evidence paths, while broad, support the role of intrinsic factor in the uptake process within the ileum. Other parts of the small intestine, such as the duodenum and jejunum, are transit points and not sites of absorption for the Vitamin B12-intrinsic factor complex. Therefore, option 'opb. Ileum' is the correct answer.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Vitamin B12 absorption is a well-understood physiological process. The intrinsic factor, secreted by the stomach, binds to Vitamin B12, forming a complex that travels through the duodenum and jejunum. However, the actual absorption of this complex occurs in the ileum. This is a consensus in medical literature, as the ileum contains specific receptors for the intrinsic factor-Vitamin B12 complex, facilitating its absorption into the bloodstream. The enhanced information provided aligns with this consensus, confirming that the ileum is the site of absorption. Therefore, the most likely correct option is 'opb. Ileum'.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 100\n}\n```",
