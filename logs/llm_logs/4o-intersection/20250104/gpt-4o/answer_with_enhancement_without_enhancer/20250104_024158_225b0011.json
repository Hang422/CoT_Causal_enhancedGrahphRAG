Better glucose tolerance\nopb. Muscle cramps\nopc. Decrease in urea level\nopd. Hypokalemia\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nTriamterene is a potassium-sparing diuretic, which means it helps retain potassium in the body, potentially leading to hyperkalemia rather than hypokalemia. This retention of potassium can cause muscle cramps, as supported by evidence paths linking potassium retention to muscle cramps. Triamterene does not have a direct effect on glucose metabolism, so it is unlikely to improve glucose tolerance. While diuretics can affect urea levels, triamterene's primary action is on potassium retention, and there is no strong consensus or evidence to suggest it significantly decreases urea levels. Therefore, the most supported effect of triamterene is the potential to cause muscle cramps due to potassium retention.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Triamterene is a potassium-sparing diuretic, which means it helps retain potassium in the body. This retention can lead to hyperkalemia, not hypokalemia, ruling out option opd. Potassium retention can cause muscle cramps, making option opb a likely effect. Triamterene does not have a known effect on glucose metabolism, so it is unlikely to improve glucose tolerance, ruling out option opa. While diuretics can affect urea levels, triamterene's primary action is on potassium, and there is no strong evidence to suggest it significantly decreases urea levels, making option opc less likely. Therefore, the most supported effect of triamterene is the potential to cause muscle cramps due to potassium retention.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}",
