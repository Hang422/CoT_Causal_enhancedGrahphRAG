Protein C deficiency\nopb. Protein S deficiency\nopc. Hemophillia\nopd. Antithrombin III deficiency\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nWarfarin-induced skin necrosis is most commonly associated with Protein C deficiency. This is because warfarin administration leads to a rapid reduction in Protein C activity, which is a natural anticoagulant, resulting in a temporary hypercoagulable state that can cause skin necrosis. The reasoning chain for Protein C deficiency aligns with the consensus and is supported by evidence paths indicating that an imbalance in Protein C can lead to thrombophilia, which in turn can cause skin necrosis. Protein S deficiency could theoretically lead to a similar outcome, but it is less commonly associated with warfarin-induced skin necrosis. Hemophilia and Antithrombin III deficiency do not typically result in skin necrosis when warfarin is administered, as they do not create the same hypercoagulable state. The evidence paths related to hemophilia and Antithrombin III are not directly relevant to warfarin-induced skin necrosis in this context.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Warfarin-induced skin necrosis is a rare but serious complication that occurs due to a paradoxical hypercoagulable state. This is primarily associated with Protein C deficiency. Warfarin, an anticoagulant, initially reduces the levels of Protein C more rapidly than other vitamin K-dependent clotting factors, leading to a temporary prothrombotic state. Protein C is a natural anticoagulant, and its deficiency exacerbates this effect, increasing the risk of thrombosis and subsequent skin necrosis. While Protein S deficiency could theoretically contribute to a similar condition, it is less commonly implicated in warfarin-induced skin necrosis. Hemophilia and Antithrombin III deficiency do not typically lead to this condition because they do not involve the same mechanism of action related to warfarin's effects. Therefore, the most likely correct answer, based on medical consensus, is Protein C deficiency.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
