Stroma\nopb. Corpora albicans\nopc. Corpora lutea\nopd. Mature follicles\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nProgesterone production in the ovary is primarily by the corpora lutea. After ovulation, the mature follicle transforms into the corpus luteum, which is composed of luteal cells. These luteal cells are responsible for synthesizing progesterone, as supported by the evidence path indicating that luteal cells are the location of progesterone production. The stroma and corpora albicans are not primary sources of progesterone; the stroma serves as supportive tissue, and the corpora albicans is a degenerated form of the corpus luteum with minimal hormone production. Therefore, the corpora lutea is the correct answer, aligning with the consensus that it is the main site of progesterone synthesis in the ovary.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Progesterone is a hormone crucial for the regulation of the menstrual cycle and maintenance of pregnancy. In the ovary, progesterone production is primarily associated with the corpus luteum, which forms from the remnants of the mature follicle after ovulation. The corpus luteum is composed of luteal cells that are specialized for the synthesis of progesterone. The stroma of the ovary serves as supportive tissue and does not play a direct role in hormone production. The corpora albicans is the scar tissue that forms after the corpus luteum degenerates and does not produce significant amounts of hormones. Therefore, based on standard medical knowledge and the enhanced information provided, the corpora lutea is the primary site of progesterone production in the ovary.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opc\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
