Flutamide\nopb. Finasteride\nopc. Prazosin\nopd. Minoxidil\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nFinasteride is a 5α reductase inhibitor that effectively reduces dihydrotestosterone (DHT) levels, leading to decreased prostate size and improved symptoms of benign prostatic hypertrophy. It also reduces hair follicle miniaturization, improving male pattern baldness. Flutamide, an androgen receptor blocker, has unclear effects on hair and prostate. Prazosin, an alpha-1 adrenergic receptor blocker, improves urinary symptoms in benign prostatic hypertrophy but has no effect on hair. Minoxidil, a vasodilator, increases blood flow to hair follicles, improving male pattern baldness but has no effect on the prostate. The evidence paths confirm the role of DHT in hair follicle structure and prostate function, supporting the effectiveness of finasteride in both conditions.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The question asks for a 5α reductase inhibitor effective in both benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH) and male pattern baldness. Finasteride is well-documented as a 5α reductase inhibitor that reduces dihydrotestosterone (DHT) levels, which is a key factor in both BPH and male pattern baldness. It is used clinically to treat both conditions by reducing prostate size and improving hair growth. Flutamide is an androgen receptor blocker, not a 5α reductase inhibitor, and is primarily used in prostate cancer treatment. Prazosin is an alpha-1 adrenergic receptor blocker used for BPH symptoms but not for hair loss. Minoxidil is a vasodilator used for hair growth but does not affect the prostate. Therefore, based on standard medical knowledge and the enhanced information provided, finasteride is the most likely correct answer.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
