Single dose in ascariasis\nopb. Immunostimulant\nopc. Paralysis of worms by depolarisation\nopd. Immunodepressant in high doses\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nLevamisole is used as a single dose treatment for ascariasis, as it is effective in causing paralysis of worms through depolarization of their muscles. It also acts as an immunostimulant, enhancing the immune response, which is supported by its association with immunologic adjuvants. However, the use of levamisole as an immunodepressant in high doses is not widely accepted or supported by standard medical consensus. Therefore, the correct answer is that levamisole is not used as an immunodepressant in high doses.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "
