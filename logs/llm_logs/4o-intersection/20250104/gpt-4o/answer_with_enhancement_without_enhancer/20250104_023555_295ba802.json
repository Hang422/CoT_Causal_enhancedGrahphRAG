Vitamin A\nopb. Vitamin C\nopc. Vitamin D\nopd. Vitamin B12\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nVitamin D is widely recognized for its role in improving insulin sensitivity, which can reduce insulin resistance. This reduction in insulin resistance is associated with a decreased risk of obesity and metabolic syndrome. The retrieved evidence supports this by linking Vitamin D to improved insulin sensitivity and its potential to treat obesity, which is a risk factor for metabolic syndrome. In contrast, Vitamin A and Vitamin C, while having antioxidant properties, do not have a clear or direct impact on insulin resistance or metabolic syndrome. Vitamin B12 is involved in energy metabolism and may influence weight management, but its direct impact on insulin resistance is unclear. Therefore, Vitamin D is the most supported option for reducing the risk of insulin resistance, obesity, and metabolic syndrome.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Vitamin D is well-documented in medical literature for its role in improving insulin sensitivity and reducing insulin resistance. This is crucial because insulin resistance is a key factor in the development of obesity and metabolic syndrome. While Vitamin A and Vitamin C have antioxidant properties, they do not have a direct impact on insulin resistance. Vitamin B12 is important for energy metabolism but lacks strong evidence for directly influencing insulin resistance. Therefore, based on the consensus and available evidence, Vitamin D is the most likely vitamin to reduce the risk of insulin resistance, obesity, and metabolic syndrome.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opc\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}\n```",
