Ascaris\nopb. Filariasis\nopc. Malaria\nopd. Oncocerciasis\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nIvermectin is indicated for the treatment of Ascaris, Filariasis, and Oncocerciasis, as it is effective against these parasitic infections. However, it is not indicated for Malaria, as it is not effective against the Plasmodium parasites that cause Malaria. The retrieved evidence path suggesting Ivermectin treats Malaria is incorrect and contradicts the standard medical consensus. Therefore, the correct answer is that Ivermectin is not indicated for Malaria.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

It is indicated for the treatment of Ascaris (roundworm), Filariasis (caused by Wuchereria bancrofti and other filarial worms), and Oncocerciasis (river blindness caused by Onchocerca volvulus). However, Ivermectin is not effective against the Plasmodium parasites responsible for Malaria. The standard medical consensus does not support the use of Ivermectin for Malaria treatment.
