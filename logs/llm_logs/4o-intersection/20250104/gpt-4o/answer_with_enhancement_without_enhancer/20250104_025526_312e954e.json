Penicillin\nopb. Cotrimoxazole\nopc. Kanamycin\nopd. Levofloxacin\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nPneumonia caused by P. carinii, now known as Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP), is an opportunistic infection commonly seen in immunocompromised individuals, such as those with HIV/AIDS. The standard treatment and prophylaxis for PJP is Cotrimoxazole (Trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole), which is effective against this organism. The reasoning chains correctly identify Cotrimoxazole as the drug of choice, supported by its effectiveness in treating and preventing PJP. Penicillin is ineffective as PJP is not a bacterial infection. Kanamycin and Levofloxacin are not appropriate treatments for PJP, as they do not target the organism effectively. The evidence paths confirm the association of opportunistic infections with Trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole, supporting its use in this context.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Pneumonia caused by Pneumocystis jirovecii, previously known as P. carinii, is a common opportunistic infection in immunocompromised individuals, particularly those with HIV/AIDS. The standard treatment for this type of pneumonia is Cotrimoxazole (Trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole), which is effective against Pneumocystis jirovecii. This is well-established in medical guidelines and literature. Penicillin is not effective as PJP is not caused by bacteria. Kanamycin and Levofloxacin are also not suitable as they do not target the organism responsible for PJP. Therefore, based on standard medical knowledge and consensus, Cotrimoxazole is the drug of choice for treating Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 100\n}",
