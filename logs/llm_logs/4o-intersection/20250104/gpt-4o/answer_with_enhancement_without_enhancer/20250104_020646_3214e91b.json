INH\nopb. Erythromycin estolate\nopc. Pyrazinamide\nopd. Ethionamide\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nCholestatic jaundice is most commonly associated with drugs that impair bile flow. Erythromycin estolate is known to cause cholestatic jaundice due to its effect on liver enzyme inhibition, leading to impaired bile flow. This aligns with the consensus that erythromycin estolate is a well-documented cause of cholestatic jaundice. INH (isoniazid), pyrazinamide, and ethionamide are more commonly associated with hepatocellular damage and hepatitis, which can lead to jaundice, but not specifically cholestatic jaundice. The evidence paths broadly support the association of these drugs with liver enzyme interactions and hepatitis, but they do not specifically address cholestatic jaundice. Therefore, erythromycin estolate is the most likely cause of cholestatic jaundice among the options provided.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "
