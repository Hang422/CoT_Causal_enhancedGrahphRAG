What action should be taken regarding the treatment of the nurse\n\n                    ### Options\n                    opa. Monitor the nurse's blood to determine whether HIV transmission has occurred or not.\nopb. Treat with full doses of zidovudine for 2weeks.\nopc. Add acyclovir to the 4weeks zidovudine regimen\nopd. Administer zidovudine with lamivudine for 4weeks.\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nIn the case of a needle stick injury involving a patient with a high viral load and low CD4 count, there is a high risk of HIV transmission. Standard medical consensus recommends immediate post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) to reduce the risk of seroconversion. The recommended regimen is a combination of antiretroviral drugs, typically including zidovudine and lamivudine, administered for 4 weeks. This regimen is supported by evidence indicating that PEP can prevent viral replication and reduce the risk of HIV infection. Monitoring alone is inadequate as it delays intervention. Acyclovir is not indicated in this context as it is not effective against HIV. Therefore, the correct action is to administer zidovudine with lamivudine for 4 weeks, aligning with standard PEP protocols.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

The standard medical practice in such scenarios is to initiate post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) as soon as possible to reduce the risk of seroconversion. The recommended PEP regimen typically includes a combination of antiretroviral drugs, specifically zidovudine and lamivudine, administered for 4 weeks. This combination is effective in preventing HIV replication and reducing the risk of infection. Monitoring alone is not sufficient as it does not prevent potential transmission. Acyclovir is not effective against HIV and is not part of the recommended PEP regimen.
