Spectrin\nopb. Ankyrin\nopc. Tubulin\nopd. Laminin\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nThe plasma membrane of a cell is connected to the cytoskeleton primarily through the interaction of spectrin and ankyrin. Spectrin is a cytoskeletal protein that binds to the plasma membrane, helping to stabilize cell shape. Ankyrin acts as an anchor, connecting spectrin to membrane proteins, thus facilitating the linkage between the cytoskeleton and the plasma membrane. This is supported by evidence showing spectrin's interaction with membrane proteins and ankyrin's role in anchoring within cells. Tubulin, while a component of microtubules, does not directly bind to the plasma membrane, and laminin is an extracellular matrix protein not directly involved in cytoskeletal binding to the plasma membrane. Therefore, the most accurate answer is ankyrin, which directly anchors spectrin to the plasma membrane, effectively connecting the cytoskeleton to the membrane.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The plasma membrane is connected to the cytoskeleton through a network of proteins, primarily involving spectrin and ankyrin. Spectrin is a cytoskeletal protein that provides structural support and helps maintain cell shape by forming a meshwork beneath the plasma membrane. Ankyrin serves as a critical link by anchoring spectrin to integral membrane proteins, thus facilitating the connection between the cytoskeleton and the plasma membrane. While tubulin is a component of microtubules and laminin is part of the extracellular matrix, neither directly binds the plasma membrane to the cytoskeleton. Therefore, ankyrin is the most accurate answer as it directly anchors spectrin to the plasma membrane, establishing the connection between the cytoskeleton and the membrane.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
