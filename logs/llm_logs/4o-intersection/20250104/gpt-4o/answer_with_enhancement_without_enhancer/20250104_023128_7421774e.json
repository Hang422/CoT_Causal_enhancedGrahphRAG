You would be concerned about the use of this drug if the patient also had what comorbid condition\n\n                    ### Options\n                    opa. Glaucoma\nopb. Essential tremor\nopc. Diabetes\nopd. Supraventricular tachycardia\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nPropranolol is a non-selective beta-blocker that can mask symptoms of hypoglycemia, such as tachycardia, which is particularly concerning in patients with diabetes. This aligns with the consensus that beta-blockers can decrease hypoglycemia awareness, making diabetes a significant comorbid condition to consider when prescribing propranolol. The evidence path supports this by linking hypoglycemia to diabetes. While propranolol can also cause bronchoconstriction, which may exacerbate asthma, this is not directly relevant to the options provided. Propranolol's effect on heart rate and cardiac output is generally beneficial in managing supraventricular tachycardia, not a concern. Its use in glaucoma and essential tremor is typically therapeutic rather than problematic. Therefore, diabetes is the comorbid condition of concern when using propranolol prophylactically after a myocardial infarction.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Propranolol is a non-selective beta-blocker that can mask the symptoms of hypoglycemia, such as tachycardia, which is particularly concerning in patients with diabetes. This is because patients with diabetes, especially those on insulin or sulfonylureas, rely on these symptoms to recognize low blood sugar levels. The masking of these symptoms can lead to unawareness of hypoglycemia, which can be dangerous. While propranolol is used therapeutically in conditions like glaucoma and essential tremor, and can be beneficial in managing supraventricular tachycardia, the primary concern with its use in a patient with diabetes is the potential for hypoglycemia unawareness. Therefore, diabetes is the comorbid condition of concern when using propranolol prophylactically after a myocardial infarction.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opc\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
