Ca transporter\nopb. Cu transporter\nopc. Zn transporter\nopd. Se transporter\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nMenke's Kinky hair syndrome is primarily caused by a defect in copper metabolism, specifically due to a malfunction in the copper transporter. This condition leads to copper deficiency (hypocupremia), which is responsible for the characteristic symptoms such as abnormal hair texture, neurological symptoms, and connective tissue disorders. The retrieved evidence paths support this by linking Menke's Kinky hair syndrome to hypocupremia, which in turn causes neurological and connective tissue symptoms. The consensus in medical biochemistry confirms that the defect in the Cu transporter is the underlying cause of Menke's Kinky hair syndrome, making option 'opb. Cu transporter' the correct answer.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Menke's Kinky hair syndrome, also known as Menkes disease, is a genetic disorder that affects copper levels in the body. It is caused by mutations in the ATP7A gene, which encodes a copper-transporting ATPase. This defect leads to impaired copper absorption and distribution, resulting in copper deficiency. The symptoms of Menke's syndrome, such as kinky hair, neurological issues, and connective tissue problems, are directly linked to this copper deficiency. The consensus in medical literature clearly identifies the defect in the copper transporter as the cause of Menke's Kinky hair syndrome. Therefore, the most likely correct option is 'opb. Cu transporter'.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 100\n}",
