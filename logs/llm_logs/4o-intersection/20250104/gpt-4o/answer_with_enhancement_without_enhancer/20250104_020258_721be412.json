Sparfloxacin\nopb. Tetracycline\nopc. Gentamicin\nopd. Clofazimine\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nPseudotumor cerebri, also known as idiopathic intracranial hypertension, is associated with certain medications. Tetracycline is well-documented in medical literature as a drug that can cause increased intracranial pressure, leading to pseudotumor cerebri. This aligns with the reasoning chain for tetracycline, which is supported by consensus. Sparfloxacin, gentamicin, and clofazimine do not have established links to pseudotumor cerebri. The retrieved evidence paths do not provide relevant support for these drugs causing pseudotumor cerebri, as they focus on unrelated effects such as ototoxicity and skin discoloration. Therefore, the most accurate answer, based on consensus and evidence, is that tetracycline is the drug that causes pseudotumor cerebri.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Pseudotumor cerebri, or idiopathic intracranial hypertension, is a condition characterized by increased intracranial pressure without an obvious cause. Certain medications are known to be associated with this condition, and tetracycline is one of the most well-documented drugs in this regard. The mechanism is thought to involve alterations in cerebrospinal fluid dynamics. Other options such as sparfloxacin, gentamicin, and clofazimine do not have established links to pseudotumor cerebri. Sparfloxacin is more associated with QT prolongation, gentamicin with ototoxicity, and clofazimine with skin discoloration. Therefore, based on standard medical knowledge and consensus, tetracycline is the most likely drug to cause pseudotumor cerebri.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
