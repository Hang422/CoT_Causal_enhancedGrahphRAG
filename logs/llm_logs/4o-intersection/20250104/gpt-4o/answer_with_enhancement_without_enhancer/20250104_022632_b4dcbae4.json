Xylose\nopb. Mannose\nopc. Glucose\nopd. Ribose\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nThe only sugar normally absorbed in the intestine against a concentration gradient is glucose. This process occurs via active transport, specifically through the SGLT1 transporter, which is a well-established mechanism in physiological consensus. The retrieved evidence path supports this by linking glucose to active biological transport. In contrast, xylose, mannose, and ribose are absorbed via passive diffusion, which occurs along their concentration gradients and does not involve active transport mechanisms. Therefore, glucose is the correct answer based on its unique absorption mechanism in the intestine.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The absorption of sugars in the intestine can occur via passive diffusion or active transport. Glucose is unique among the common dietary sugars because it is absorbed against its concentration gradient through active transport. This process is mediated by the sodium-glucose linked transporter 1 (SGLT1), which uses the energy from sodium gradients to transport glucose into the intestinal cells. This mechanism is well-documented and widely accepted in physiological studies. In contrast, other sugars like xylose, mannose, and ribose are absorbed through passive diffusion, which does not involve moving against a concentration gradient. Therefore, based on standard medical knowledge and the enhanced information provided, glucose is the only sugar absorbed in this manner.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opc\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
