Heparin sulfate\nopb. Protamine sulfate\nopc. Low molecular weight heparin\nopd. Warfarin\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nFor prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism in patients undergoing cancer surgery, the standard consensus is to use low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) due to its effectiveness and convenience compared to unfractionated heparin. LMWH is preferred because it has a more predictable pharmacokinetic profile, does not require routine monitoring, and has a lower risk of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. The evidence paths support the association of LMWH with effective thrombosis prevention. Heparin sulfate is effective but less convenient than LMWH. Warfarin is not ideal for immediate prophylaxis due to the need for monitoring and delayed onset of action. Protamine sulfate is not an anticoagulant; it is used to reverse the effects of heparin, making it irrelevant for prophylaxis. Therefore, the anticoagulant of choice is low molecular weight heparin.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "
