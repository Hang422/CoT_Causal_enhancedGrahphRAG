Bromocriptine\nopb. Levodopa\nopc. Amantadine\nopd. Metoclopramide\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nHyperprolactinemia is a side effect of metoclopramide. Metoclopramide acts as a dopamine receptor antagonist, which leads to increased prolactin secretion and can result in hyperprolactinemia. This aligns with the consensus that dopamine receptor blockade increases prolactin levels. The evidence path supports this by associating metoclopramide with dopamine receptor interactions. In contrast, bromocriptine, levodopa, and amantadine are associated with increased dopamine activity, which typically decreases prolactin secretion, making hyperprolactinemia unlikely with these drugs. The evidence paths for these drugs do not contradict this consensus, as they focus on their roles in dopamine interaction and stimulation, which are consistent with decreased prolactin levels.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Hyperprolactinemia is a condition characterized by elevated levels of prolactin in the blood. The core medical principle here is that drugs that antagonize dopamine receptors can lead to increased prolactin secretion because dopamine normally inhibits prolactin release. Metoclopramide is a dopamine receptor antagonist, which can block dopamine's inhibitory effect on prolactin secretion, leading to hyperprolactinemia. In contrast, bromocriptine, levodopa, and amantadine are associated with increased dopamine activity, which typically reduces prolactin levels. Therefore, based on the mechanism of action and the consensus in pharmacology, metoclopramide is the most likely drug to cause hyperprolactinemia.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
