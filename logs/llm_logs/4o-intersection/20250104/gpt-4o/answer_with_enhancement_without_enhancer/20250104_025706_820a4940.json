They are called as \"high ceiling\" diuretics\nopb. They act on Na+.K+.2Cl- symporter\nopc. They can cause hyperuricemia\nopd. Loop diuretics lead to hypercalcemia and hypomagnesimia\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nLoop diuretics are known as 'high ceiling' diuretics due to their potent diuretic effect, which aligns with the consensus that they significantly increase diuresis. They act on the Na+-K+-2Cl- symporter in the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle, inhibiting the reabsorption of sodium, potassium, and chloride, which is a well-established mechanism of action. Loop diuretics can cause hyperuricemia by increasing uric acid reabsorption, which is consistent with clinical observations. However, they lead to increased excretion of calcium and magnesium, resulting in hypocalcemia and hypomagnesemia, not hypercalcemia. The retrieved evidence paths broadly support the excretory function of loop diuretics but do not directly address the specific electrolyte imbalances. Therefore, the statement that loop diuretics lead to hypercalcemia is incorrect, as they are more commonly associated with hypocalcemia due to increased calcium excretion.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "
