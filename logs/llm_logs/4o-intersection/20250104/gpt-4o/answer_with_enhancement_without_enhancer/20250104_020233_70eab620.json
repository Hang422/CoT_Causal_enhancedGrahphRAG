Acute renal failure\nopb. Development of antiplatelet antibodies\nopc. Encephalitis secondary to liver dysfunction\nopd. Hemorrhagic stroke\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nFibrinolytic drugs, used to dissolve blood clots, increase the risk of bleeding due to systemic fibrinolysis. This increased bleeding risk can lead to hemorrhagic stroke, which is a well-documented adverse effect. The reasoning chains correctly identify the process: fibrinolytic drugs activate plasminogen, leading to plasmin formation and fibrin degradation, which can result in bleeding complications, including hemorrhagic stroke. The retrieved evidence paths support this by linking fibrinolytic agents to hemorrhage and hemorrhagic stroke. Other options, such as acute renal failure, development of antiplatelet antibodies, and encephalitis secondary to liver dysfunction, are not commonly associated with fibrinolytic therapy. Therefore, the most likely adverse effect of fibrinolytic drugs in the treatment of acute myocardial infarction is hemorrhagic stroke.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Fibrinolytic drugs, such as tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), are used to dissolve blood clots in the treatment of acute myocardial infarction. The primary mechanism involves the conversion of plasminogen to plasmin, which then degrades fibrin clots. This systemic activation of fibrinolysis increases the risk of bleeding complications. Among the potential adverse effects, hemorrhagic stroke is the most significant and well-documented risk associated with fibrinolytic therapy. This is due to the increased likelihood of bleeding in the brain, which can occur as a result of the systemic breakdown of clots. Other options, such as acute renal failure, development of antiplatelet antibodies, and encephalitis secondary to liver dysfunction, are not commonly linked to the use of fibrinolytic drugs. Therefore, based on standard medical knowledge and consensus, the most likely adverse effect of fibrinolytic drugs in this context is hemorrhagic stroke.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
