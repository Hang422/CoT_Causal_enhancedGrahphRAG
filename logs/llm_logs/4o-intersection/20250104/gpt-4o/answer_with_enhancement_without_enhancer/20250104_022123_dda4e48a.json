Produced by alpha cells of pancreas\nopb. Two polypeptide chains are bound by disulfide linkages\nopc. Shifts potassium outside the cell\nopd. S.c insulin tl/2 is 60 mins\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nInsulin is produced by the beta cells of the pancreas, not the alpha cells, which produce glucagon. Insulin consists of two polypeptide chains (A and B) that are connected by disulfide linkages, which is a well-established biochemical fact. Insulin facilitates the uptake of potassium into cells, not the shift of potassium outside the cells. The half-life of subcutaneous insulin is approximately 5-10 minutes, not 60 minutes. The retrieved evidence paths broadly confirm insulin's role in energy metabolism and glucose tolerance, which are consistent with its physiological functions but do not directly address the specific options provided.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"To determine the true statement regarding insulin, we need to evaluate each option based on established medical knowledge. Option 'opa' is incorrect because insulin is produced by the beta cells of the pancreas, not the alpha cells, which produce glucagon. Option 'opb' is correct as insulin is composed of two polypeptide chains (A and B) connected by disulfide linkages, which is a well-documented biochemical characteristic of insulin. Option 'opc' is incorrect because insulin promotes the uptake of potassium into cells, rather than shifting it outside. Option 'opd' is incorrect because the half-life of subcutaneous insulin is approximately 5-10 minutes, not 60 minutes. Therefore, the most accurate statement is option 'opb'.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
