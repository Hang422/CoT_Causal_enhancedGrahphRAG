Leucine\nopb. Lysine\nopc. Methionine\nopd. Proline\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nEssential amino acids are those that cannot be synthesized by the human body and must be obtained from the diet. Leucine, lysine, and methionine are all essential amino acids, as they are required for protein synthesis, growth, tissue repair, and methylation processes, respectively. Proline, on the other hand, is a non-essential amino acid because the body can synthesize it. The evidence paths, while broad, confirm that leucine, lysine, and methionine interact with cells and are involved in amino acid processes, supporting their classification as essential. Proline's ability to be synthesized by the body aligns with its classification as non-essential. Therefore, the correct answer is that proline is not an essential amino acid.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The core medical principle here is the classification of amino acids into essential and non-essential categories. Essential amino acids cannot be synthesized by the human body and must be obtained through diet. Leucine, lysine, and methionine are well-established as essential amino acids due to their roles in protein synthesis and other metabolic processes. Proline, however, is classified as a non-essential amino acid because the body can synthesize it from other compounds. This classification is widely accepted in the field of biochemistry and aligns with the enhanced information provided. Therefore, the most likely correct answer is that proline is not an essential amino acid.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 100\n}",
