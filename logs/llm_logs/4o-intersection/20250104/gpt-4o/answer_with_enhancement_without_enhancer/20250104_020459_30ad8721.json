Imiquimod\nopb. Podophylline\nopc. Interferon\nopd. Acyclovir\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nImiquimod is a topical immunomodulator that activates the immune response and is used for the treatment of genital warts, aligning with standard medical consensus. Podophylline is also used topically for genital warts but acts through a cytotoxic mechanism rather than immunomodulation. Interferon can modulate the immune response and has been used in some cases for genital warts, but it is not the primary treatment. Acyclovir is an antiviral used for herpes simplex virus infections and is not typically used for genital warts. The evidence paths confirm that imiquimod is associated with immune response activation and topical application, supporting its use in treating genital warts.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The question asks for a topical immunomodulator used in the treatment of genital warts. Imiquimod is a well-known topical immunomodulator that works by activating the immune system to fight against the human papillomavirus (HPV), which causes genital warts. Podophylline, while used for genital warts, is not an immunomodulator but rather a cytotoxic agent. Interferon, although it can modulate the immune response, is not primarily used topically for genital warts. Acyclovir is an antiviral medication used for herpes simplex virus infections and is not relevant to the treatment of genital warts. Therefore, based on standard medical knowledge and consensus, imiquimod is the most appropriate choice for a topical immunomodulator used in the treatment of genital warts.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
