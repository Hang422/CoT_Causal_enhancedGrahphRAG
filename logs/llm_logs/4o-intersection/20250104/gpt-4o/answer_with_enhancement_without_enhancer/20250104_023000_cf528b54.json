This results in the production of large volumes of dilute urine, which is reflected in low urine osmolality. The standard consensus is that urine osmolality in diabetes insipidus is typically less than 300 mmol/L. The reasoning chain for option 'opb' (<300 mmol/L) aligns with this consensus, as it correctly identifies the link between decreased ADH effect, inability to concentrate urine, and low urine osmolality. The retrieved evidence paths confirm the association of diabetes insipidus with polyuria, supporting the understanding of excessive water loss and dilute urine. Other options suggesting higher osmolality values (<600 mmol/L and <900 mmol/L) are less consistent with the typical presentation of diabetes insipidus. Therefore, the most accurate and consensus-supported answer is option 'opb' (<300 mmol/L).\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "
