Increases liver glycogenolysis\nopb. Causes broachiolar constriction\nopc. Evokes extrasystoles in the heart\nopd. Produces restlessness and anxiety\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nEpinephrine, when administered intravenously in high doses, is known to increase liver glycogenolysis, leading to increased blood glucose levels, which aligns with standard pharmacological consensus. It also evokes extrasystoles in the heart due to its stimulatory effects on cardiac tissue, increasing heart rate. Additionally, epinephrine can produce restlessness and anxiety as a result of heightened sympathetic nervous system activity. However, epinephrine typically causes bronchodilation rather than bronchiolar constriction, as it acts on beta-2 adrenergic receptors in the lungs to relax bronchial muscles. Therefore, the action of causing bronchiolar constriction is not consistent with the known effects of epinephrine, making it the correct answer to the question.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

When administered in high doses intravenously, it increases liver glycogenolysis (opa) by stimulating beta-2 adrenergic receptors, leading to increased blood glucose levels.
