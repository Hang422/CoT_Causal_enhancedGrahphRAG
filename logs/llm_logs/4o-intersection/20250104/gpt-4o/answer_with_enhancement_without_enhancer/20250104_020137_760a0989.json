Aldosterone\nopb. DOCA\nopc. Fludrocoeisone\nopd. Triamcinolone\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nAldosterone is the most potent mineralocorticoid, as it has a strong sodium retention effect, leading to increased blood volume and potent mineralocorticoid activity. This is supported by its role in causing hypernatremia, a condition associated with mineralocorticoid activity. Fludrocortisone also has strong sodium retention and is used to treat conditions like hypernatremia, indicating significant mineralocorticoid activity, but it is less potent than aldosterone. DOCA has moderate sodium retention and is less potent than aldosterone. Triamcinolone has minimal mineralocorticoid activity and is not considered potent in this regard. Therefore, based on consensus and evidence, aldosterone is the most potent mineralocorticoid.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"In the context of mineralocorticoid potency, aldosterone is widely recognized as the most potent natural mineralocorticoid. It plays a crucial role in sodium retention, which is a key function of mineralocorticoids. Fludrocortisone, while having significant mineralocorticoid activity and used therapeutically for its effects, is a synthetic analog and is generally considered less potent than aldosterone in terms of natural physiological activity. DOCA (Deoxycorticosterone acetate) has moderate mineralocorticoid activity but is not as potent as aldosterone. Triamcinolone is primarily a glucocorticoid with minimal mineralocorticoid activity. Therefore, based on standard medical knowledge and consensus, aldosterone is the most potent mineralocorticoid.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
