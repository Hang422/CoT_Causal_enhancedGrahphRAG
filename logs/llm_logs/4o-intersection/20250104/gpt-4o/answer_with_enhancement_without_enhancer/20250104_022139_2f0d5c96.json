Cough suppression\nopb. Anti-emesis\nopc. Miosis\nopd. Truncal rigidity\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nOpioids are known to have several pharmacological actions. Cough suppression is a well-documented effect of opioids, supported by evidence paths indicating their use in treating cough. Miosis, or pupil constriction, is another common effect of opioids, corroborated by evidence paths linking opioids to miosis disorders. Truncal rigidity, characterized by muscle stiffness, is also a recognized pharmacological action of opioids, particularly in high doses or specific clinical settings. However, anti-emesis is not a typical pharmacological action of opioids; in fact, opioids are more commonly associated with causing nausea and vomiting rather than preventing it. Therefore, anti-emesis is the action not typically associated with opioids.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Opioids have several well-documented pharmacological actions. Cough suppression is a recognized effect due to opioids' action on the central nervous system, specifically the cough center in the medulla. Miosis, or pupil constriction, is another common effect of opioids, resulting from their action on the parasympathetic nervous system. Truncal rigidity is a less common but known effect, particularly with high doses or certain opioid types, affecting the central nervous system and leading to muscle stiffness. On the other hand, anti-emesis is not a typical action of opioids. In fact, opioids are more commonly associated with causing nausea and vomiting rather than preventing it. Therefore, based on standard medical knowledge and consensus, anti-emesis is not a pharmacological action of opioids.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
