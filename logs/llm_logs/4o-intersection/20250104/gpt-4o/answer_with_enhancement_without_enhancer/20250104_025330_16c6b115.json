Interleukin-6\nopb. Interleukin-6 receptor\nopc. Interleukin-5\nopd. Interleukin-5 receptor\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nTocilizumab is a monoclonal antibody that specifically targets the interleukin-6 receptor, not interleukin-6 itself. By binding to the interleukin-6 receptor, tocilizumab prevents interleukin-6 from interacting with its receptor, thereby blocking the signaling pathway that leads to inflammation. This mechanism helps reduce the inflammatory response associated with rheumatoid arthritis. The retrieved evidence supports this by showing interactions between tocilizumab and the interleukin-6 receptor, confirming its role in modulating immune responses. There is no evidence or consensus supporting tocilizumab's interaction with interleukin-5 or its receptor, aligning with the reasoning that it is specific for the interleukin-6 receptor.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

It specifically targets the interleukin-6 receptor (IL-6R), not interleukin-6 itself. By binding to the IL-6 receptor, tocilizumab inhibits the interaction of interleukin-6 with its receptor, thereby blocking the downstream signaling pathways that lead to inflammation. This mechanism of action is well-documented and widely accepted in the medical community. There is no evidence or consensus supporting tocilizumab's interaction with interleukin-5 or its receptor.
