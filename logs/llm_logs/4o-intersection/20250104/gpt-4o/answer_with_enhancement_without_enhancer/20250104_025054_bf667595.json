Vasopressin\nopb. Terlipressin\nopc. Desmopressin\nopd. Pralipressin\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nNeurogenic diabetes insipidus, also known as central diabetes insipidus, is characterized by a deficiency of vasopressin (antidiuretic hormone). The standard treatment involves replacing this hormone with a synthetic analog. Desmopressin is the preferred drug of choice for this condition due to its effectiveness in mimicking the action of vasopressin, reducing polyuria and polydipsia. The retrieved evidence paths confirm that vasopressin analogs, such as Desmopressin, are used to treat central diabetes insipidus. Other options like Vasopressin, Terlipressin, and Pralipressin are not typically used for this condition, as Desmopressin is specifically designed to address the lack of antidiuretic hormone in neurogenic diabetes insipidus.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

The treatment involves replacing this hormone with a synthetic analog. Desmopressin is the preferred drug of choice because it is a synthetic analog of vasopressin that effectively reduces the symptoms of polyuria and polydipsia associated with this condition. While vasopressin itself could theoretically be used, desmopressin is favored due to its longer duration of action and fewer side effects. Other options like Terlipressin and Pralipressin are not typically used for this condition. Therefore, based on standard medical knowledge and consensus, Desmopressin is the most appropriate choice.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opc\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
