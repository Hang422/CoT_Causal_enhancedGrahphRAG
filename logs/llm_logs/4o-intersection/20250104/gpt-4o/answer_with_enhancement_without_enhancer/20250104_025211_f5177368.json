Retinol\nopb. Retinal\nopc. Retinoic acids\nopd. All of the above\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nVitamin A functions are related to retinol, retinal, and retinoic acids. Retinol is a form of vitamin A that supports vision and immune function. Retinal, derived from retinol, is essential for vision, particularly in the conversion of light into signals in the retina. Retinoic acids, another derivative, play a crucial role in regulating gene expression and cellular differentiation. The reasoning chain for each option aligns with the consensus that vitamin A is involved in these processes. The evidence paths, while broad, confirm the presence and role of retinoids in cellular processes, supporting the comprehensive role of vitamin A in these functions. Therefore, the correct answer is that vitamin A is related to all of the above: retinol, retinal, and retinoic acids.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "
