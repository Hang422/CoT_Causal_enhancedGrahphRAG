Mannitol\nopb. Spironolactone\nopc. Furosemide\nopd. Hydrochlorothiazide\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nMannitol is an osmotic diuretic that increases plasma volume, which can exacerbate cardiac failure by increasing the workload on the heart. This makes it contraindicated in cardiac failure. Spironolactone is a potassium-sparing diuretic that helps reduce fluid overload and is beneficial in managing cardiac failure. Furosemide, a loop diuretic, is effective in reducing fluid overload and is commonly used in treating cardiac failure. Hydrochlorothiazide, a thiazide diuretic, is also used to reduce fluid overload and can be beneficial in mild cardiac failure. The evidence paths confirm that mannitol is an osmotic diuretic and that spironolactone is a potassium-sparing diuretic, supporting their respective roles in cardiac failure management. Therefore, mannitol is the diuretic contraindicated in the presence of cardiac failure.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"In the context of cardiac failure, the primary concern with diuretics is their effect on fluid balance and cardiac workload. Mannitol is an osmotic diuretic that works by drawing fluid into the vascular space, which can increase plasma volume and potentially exacerbate cardiac failure by increasing the workload on the heart. This makes it contraindicated in patients with cardiac failure. On the other hand, spironolactone, furosemide, and hydrochlorothiazide are used to manage fluid overload in cardiac failure. Spironolactone is a potassium-sparing diuretic that helps reduce fluid overload and is beneficial in managing cardiac failure. Furosemide, a loop diuretic, is effective in reducing fluid overload and is commonly used in treating cardiac failure. Hydrochlorothiazide, a thiazide diuretic, is also used to reduce fluid overload and can be beneficial in mild cardiac failure. Therefore, based on standard medical knowledge and the enhanced information provided, mannitol is the diuretic contraindicated in the presence of cardiac failure.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
