Fatty acids\nopb. Ketone bodies\nopc. Glucose\nopd. Any of the above\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nIn normal conditions, the primary source of energy for cardiac muscle is fatty acids, which undergo beta-oxidation to produce ATP. This is supported by the consensus that fatty acids are the main energy substrate for the heart, providing approximately 60-70% of its energy needs. Ketone bodies and glucose can also be used for ATP production, but they serve as secondary and lesser energy sources, respectively. The retrieved evidence paths broadly associate oxidation with ATP production, which aligns with the metabolic processes of fatty acids and ketone bodies. However, these paths are too general to specify the primary energy source. Therefore, the most accurate answer is that fatty acids are the primary energy source for cardiac muscle under normal conditions.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

Fatty acids undergo beta-oxidation to produce ATP, which is essential for the continuous and high-energy demands of the heart. This is supported by the consensus that fatty acids provide approximately 60-70% of the heart's energy needs. While ketone bodies and glucose can also be utilized by cardiac muscle, they are considered secondary sources of energy under normal conditions.
