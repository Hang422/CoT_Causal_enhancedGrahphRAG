Mouth\nopb. Stomach\nopc. Small intestine\nopd. Large intestine\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nThe digestion of disaccharides primarily occurs in the small intestine. Disaccharides such as sucrose and lactose are broken down by specific enzymes like sucrase and lactase, which are located in the small intestine. This aligns with the consensus that the small intestine is the main site for disaccharide digestion, where these enzymes facilitate the conversion of disaccharides into monosaccharides for absorption. The evidence paths support this by indicating interactions between enzymes like sucrase and the small intestine, confirming the presence and activity of these enzymes in this location. Other parts of the digestive tract, such as the mouth and stomach, do not significantly contribute to disaccharide digestion, and the large intestine is not a primary site for this process, although some bacterial fermentation can occur there.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The digestion of disaccharides primarily occurs in the small intestine. This is due to the presence of specific enzymes such as sucrase, lactase, and maltase, which are located in the brush border of the small intestine. These enzymes are responsible for breaking down disaccharides into monosaccharides, which can then be absorbed into the bloodstream. The mouth and stomach do not play a significant role in the digestion of disaccharides, as they lack the necessary enzymes. The large intestine is also not a primary site for disaccharide digestion, although some bacterial fermentation of undigested carbohydrates can occur there. Therefore, based on standard medical knowledge and consensus, the small intestine is the main site for disaccharide digestion.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opc\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
