Leydig cells\nopb. Seolie cells\nopc. Seminiferous tubules\nopd. Epididymis\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nTestosterone production is primarily attributed to Leydig cells, which are located in the interstitial tissue of the testes. This aligns with the consensus that Leydig cells are the main producers of testosterone. The evidence path 'Structure of interstitial cell of Leydig-LOCATION_OF->Testosterone' supports this by indicating the direct association between Leydig cells and testosterone production. The other options, such as Sertoli cells (misinterpreted as 'Seolie cells'), seminiferous tubules, and epididymis, are not primarily involved in testosterone production. Sertoli cells support sperm development, seminiferous tubules are involved in sperm production, and the epididymis is responsible for sperm maturation, none of which are directly linked to testosterone synthesis. Therefore, Leydig cells are the correct answer for the primary source of testosterone production.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

These cells are responsible for synthesizing and secreting testosterone, a key male sex hormone. The other options provided do not primarily contribute to testosterone production: Sertoli cells (misinterpreted as 'Seolie cells') are involved in nurturing and supporting the development of sperm cells, seminiferous tubules are the site of spermatogenesis, and the epididymis is involved in the maturation and storage of sperm.
