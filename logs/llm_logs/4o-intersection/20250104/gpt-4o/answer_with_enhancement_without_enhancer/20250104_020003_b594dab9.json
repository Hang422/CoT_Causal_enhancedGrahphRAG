Ethanolamine oleate\nopb. Octreotide\nopc. Propanolol\nopd. Phytonadione\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nThe drug of choice for bleeding oesophageal varices is Octreotide. Octreotide works by causing vasoconstriction of the splanchnic circulation, which reduces portal pressure and helps control bleeding from oesophageal varices. This aligns with the consensus that Octreotide is effective in acute management of variceal bleeding due to its ability to decrease portal hypertension. Propranolol, while useful in preventing variceal bleeding by reducing portal hypertension, is not typically used for acute bleeding control. Ethanolamine oleate is used in sclerotherapy to obliterate varices, but it is not the first-line pharmacological treatment. Phytonadione (Vitamin K) improves coagulation but is not directly effective in controlling variceal bleeding. The evidence paths confirm Octreotide's role in treating conditions related to blood circulation, supporting its use in this context.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"In the management of bleeding oesophageal varices, the primary goal is to control the bleeding and reduce portal hypertension. Octreotide is a somatostatin analogue that effectively reduces portal pressure by causing vasoconstriction in the splanchnic circulation, making it the drug of choice for acute bleeding episodes. While propranolol is used for long-term prevention of variceal bleeding, it is not suitable for acute management. Ethanolamine oleate is used in sclerotherapy but is not a first-line pharmacological treatment. Phytonadione (Vitamin K) is used to correct coagulopathy but does not directly address variceal bleeding. Therefore, based on standard medical knowledge and consensus, Octreotide is the most appropriate choice for acute bleeding oesophageal varices.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
