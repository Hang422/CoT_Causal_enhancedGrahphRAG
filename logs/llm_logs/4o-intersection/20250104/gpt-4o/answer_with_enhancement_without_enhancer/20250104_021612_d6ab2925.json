Methimazole\nopb. Propylthiouraril\nopc. Carbimazole\nopd. Perchlorate\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nIn the treatment of hyperthyroidism during the first trimester of pregnancy, Propylthiouracil (PTU) is preferred due to its lower placental transfer and reduced risk of fetal abnormalities compared to Methimazole and Carbimazole. Methimazole and Carbimazole, which is metabolized to Methimazole, are associated with a higher risk of fetal abnormalities and are not recommended during the first trimester. Perchlorate is less commonly used and has potential for fetal harm, making it unsuitable for use in pregnancy. The retrieved evidence paths involving Carbimazole and Methimazole do not directly address the question of fetal safety and are therefore not relevant to the decision-making process for this specific clinical scenario.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"In the treatment of hyperthyroidism during the first trimester of pregnancy, the primary concern is minimizing the risk of fetal abnormalities. Methimazole and Carbimazole are associated with teratogenic effects, particularly when used in the first trimester. Propylthiouracil (PTU) is preferred during this period because it has a lower risk of crossing the placenta and causing fetal harm. Perchlorate is not commonly used due to its potential for fetal harm and is not recommended in pregnancy. Therefore, based on standard medical knowledge and consensus, Propylthiouracil is the drug of choice for managing hyperthyroidism in the first trimester of pregnancy.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
