This hormone is produced in which one of the following anatomical locations?\n\n                    ### Options\n                    opa. Hypothalamus\nopb. Anterior pituitary\nopc. Posterior pituitary\nopd. Adrenal cortex\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nOxytocin is a hormone responsible for causing uterine contractions during labor. It is synthesized in the hypothalamus and then transported to the posterior pituitary gland, where it is stored and later released into the bloodstream. This process aligns with the consensus that the hypothalamus is the site of oxytocin production, while the posterior pituitary is responsible for its storage and release. The retrieved evidence paths, although broad, support the anatomical relationship between the hypothalamus and the posterior pituitary, confirming the correct synthesis and release pathway of oxytocin. Therefore, the hormone causing uterine contractions is produced in the hypothalamus.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The hormone responsible for causing uterine contractions during labor is oxytocin. Oxytocin is synthesized in the hypothalamus and then transported to the posterior pituitary gland, where it is stored and released into the bloodstream. This process is well-documented in medical literature and aligns with the consensus that the hypothalamus is the site of oxytocin production. Although the posterior pituitary is involved in the storage and release of oxytocin, the question specifically asks for the location of production, which is the hypothalamus.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
