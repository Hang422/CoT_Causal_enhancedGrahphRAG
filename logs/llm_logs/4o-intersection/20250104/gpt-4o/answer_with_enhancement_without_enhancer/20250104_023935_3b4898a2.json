Meningitis\nopb. Pericarditis\nopc. Ileo-caecal tuberculosis\nopd. Adrenal involvement\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nSteroids are indicated in tuberculous meningitis and pericarditis due to their ability to reduce inflammation, which is a key component of these conditions. The evidence paths support this by linking inflammation with steroid treatment. In ileo-caecal tuberculosis, steroids are not typically used as it is a localized intestinal infection where anti-tubercular therapy is the primary treatment. The evidence paths do not provide relevant support for steroid use in this context. In adrenal tuberculosis, while steroids can mimic adrenal hormones, they are not primarily used for inflammation in this condition, as the main issue is adrenal insufficiency rather than inflammation. Therefore, steroids are not indicated for adrenal involvement in tuberculosis. The consensus aligns with the reasoning that steroids are not indicated in ileo-caecal tuberculosis, making it the exception.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"In the management of tuberculosis, steroids are used to reduce inflammation in specific conditions where inflammation can lead to severe complications. Tuberculous meningitis and pericarditis are two such conditions where inflammation can cause significant morbidity, and thus, steroids are indicated to help manage this inflammation. In ileo-caecal tuberculosis, the primary treatment is anti-tubercular therapy, as it is a localized infection, and steroids are not typically used. In the case of adrenal involvement, the issue is primarily adrenal insufficiency rather than inflammation, and while steroids can be used to replace adrenal hormones, they are not used for their anti-inflammatory properties in this context. Therefore, the exception where steroids are not indicated for their anti-inflammatory effects is ileo-caecal tuberculosis. This aligns with the consensus that steroids are not typically used in this form of tuberculosis.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opc\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}\n```",
