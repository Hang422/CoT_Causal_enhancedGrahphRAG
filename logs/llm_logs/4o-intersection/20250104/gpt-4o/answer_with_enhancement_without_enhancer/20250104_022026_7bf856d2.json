Loxatidine\nopb. Pirenzepine\nopc. Omeprazole\nopd. Famotidine\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nOmeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor that effectively blocks both basal and stimulated gastric acid secretion by inhibiting the H+/K+ ATPase enzyme in the gastric parietal cells. It does not affect cholinergic, histaminergic, or gastrin receptors, aligning with the consensus that it specifically targets the final step of acid production. The evidence paths confirm its classification as a proton pump inhibitor, which supports its mechanism of action. In contrast, Loxatidine and Famotidine are H2 receptor antagonists, which block histamine-induced acid secretion and thus affect histaminergic receptors. Pirenzepine is an anticholinergic agent that reduces gastric acid secretion by affecting cholinergic receptors. Therefore, Omeprazole is the only option that meets the criteria of blocking gastric acid secretion without affecting the specified receptors.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The question asks for a drug that blocks both basal and stimulated gastric acid secretion without affecting cholinergic, histaminergic, or gastrin receptors. Omeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor that works by inhibiting the H+/K+ ATPase enzyme in gastric parietal cells, which is the final step in acid production. This mechanism does not involve cholinergic, histaminergic, or gastrin receptors, making it the most suitable choice. Loxatidine and Famotidine are H2 receptor antagonists, which affect histaminergic receptors, and Pirenzepine is an anticholinergic agent, affecting cholinergic receptors. Therefore, based on the mechanism of action and the criteria provided, Omeprazole is the correct answer.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opc\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
