Child's presentation is most likely due to the deficiency of which enzyme?\n\n                    ### Options\n                    opa. HGPase\nopb. Adenosine Deaminase\nopc. APase\nopd. Acid Maltase\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nThe child's symptoms, including aggressive and self-mutilating behavior, poor concentration, joint pain, and reduced urinary output, are characteristic of Lesch-Nyhan syndrome. This condition is caused by a deficiency in the enzyme hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRT). The reasoning chains correctly identify HGPRT deficiency as the cause, aligning with the consensus that Lesch-Nyhan syndrome results from a disorder of purine metabolism leading to hyperuricemia and neurological symptoms. The retrieved evidence paths support this by linking purine metabolism disorders and hyperuricemia to Lesch-Nyhan syndrome and its symptoms. Other options, such as deficiencies in adenosine deaminase, acid phosphatase, or acid maltase, do not match the symptom profile or the specific metabolic pathway involved in this case.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "
