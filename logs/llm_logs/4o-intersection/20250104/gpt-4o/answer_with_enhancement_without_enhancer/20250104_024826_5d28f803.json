Chlorpropamide\nopb. Glibenclamide\nopc. Glicazide\nopd. Glipizide\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nChlorpropamide is a sulfonylurea drug that stimulates insulin release, making it effective in treating type 2 diabetes mellitus. Additionally, it has an antidiuretic effect, which can be beneficial in treating diabetes insipidus, although this use is less common and not a primary indication. The other options, Glibenclamide, Glicazide, and Glipizide, are also sulfonylureas used to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus by stimulating insulin release, but they do not have a known effect on diabetes insipidus. Therefore, Chlorpropamide is the only drug among the options that is used to treat both diabetes mellitus and diabetes insipidus, aligning with the consensus that it has a unique antidiuretic property among sulfonylureas.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Chlorpropamide is a sulfonylurea that is primarily used to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus by stimulating insulin release. It is unique among the sulfonylureas listed because it also has an antidiuretic effect, which can be beneficial in treating diabetes insipidus. This dual action is not a primary indication but is recognized in medical literature. The other options, Glibenclamide, Glicazide, and Glipizide, are also sulfonylureas used for type 2 diabetes mellitus but do not have an effect on diabetes insipidus. Therefore, based on the consensus and known pharmacological properties, Chlorpropamide is the most likely correct answer for treating both conditions.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}\n```",
