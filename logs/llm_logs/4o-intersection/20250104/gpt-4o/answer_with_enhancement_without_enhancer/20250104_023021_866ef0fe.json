It is more common with huminsulin\nopb. It may occur in the presence of infections\nopc. It may be due to antibodies to insulin\nopd. Use of glucocorticoids may be useful in severe cases\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nIn evaluating insulin resistance in diabetic patients, the following insights are aligned with medical consensus: (opb) Infections can lead to an inflammatory response, which is known to increase insulin resistance, supported by evidence linking inflammatory responses to insulin resistance. (opc) The presence of antibodies to insulin can bind to insulin, reducing its effectiveness and thereby increasing insulin resistance, which is consistent with known mechanisms of insulin resistance. (opd) The use of glucocorticoids is known to increase blood glucose levels and worsen insulin resistance, contradicting the idea that they would be useful in severe cases of insulin resistance. (opa) 'Huminsulin' is a common type of insulin and does not inherently lead to increased insulin resistance compared to other types, making this statement the exception. Therefore, the correct answer is that insulin resistance is not more common with huminsulin.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

(opc) Antibodies to insulin can bind to insulin, reducing its effectiveness and contributing to insulin resistance, which is a recognized mechanism. (opd) Glucocorticoids are known to increase blood glucose levels and exacerbate insulin resistance, making their use counterproductive in managing insulin resistance. (opa) 'Huminsulin' is a type of insulin that does not inherently cause more insulin resistance compared to other types.
