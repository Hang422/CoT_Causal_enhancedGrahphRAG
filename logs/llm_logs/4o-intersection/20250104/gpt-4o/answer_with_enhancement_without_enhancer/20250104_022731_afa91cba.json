Collecting duct\nopb. Glomerulus\nopc. Proximal convoluted tubule\nopd. Loop of Henle\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nAldosterone primarily acts on the distal nephron, specifically the collecting duct, where it promotes sodium reabsorption and potassium excretion, contributing to water retention and electrolyte balance. This is supported by the consensus that aldosterone increases sodium channels in the collecting duct, enhancing sodium reabsorption. The retrieved evidence paths, such as aldosterone's interaction with sodium channels and its role in excretory function within nephrons, align with this understanding. Other nephron segments like the glomerulus, proximal convoluted tubule, and loop of Henle are not primary sites of aldosterone action. Therefore, the correct answer is that aldosterone acts at the collecting duct.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Aldosterone is a hormone that plays a crucial role in regulating sodium and potassium balance in the body. It primarily acts on the distal nephron, specifically the collecting duct, where it enhances sodium reabsorption and potassium excretion. This action is facilitated by increasing the number of sodium channels and sodium-potassium pumps in the cells of the collecting duct. The enhanced information aligns with the standard medical knowledge that the collecting duct is the primary site of aldosterone action. Other parts of the nephron, such as the glomerulus, proximal convoluted tubule, and loop of Henle, are not the main targets for aldosterone's effects. Therefore, the most likely correct option is that aldosterone acts at the collecting duct.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
