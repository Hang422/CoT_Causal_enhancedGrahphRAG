Retro bulbar neuritis\nopb. Deafness\nopc. Red urine\nopd. Peripheral neuritis\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nEthambutol is known to cause optic nerve toxicity, which can lead to retro bulbar neuritis. This aligns with the consensus that ethambutol's primary adverse effect is on the optic nerve, potentially causing vision-related issues. The retrieved evidence paths support this by linking ethambutol to processes involving the optic nerve. There is no strong consensus or evidence linking ethambutol to deafness, red urine, or peripheral neuritis as primary side effects. Therefore, the most accurate and consensus-supported effect of ethambutol is retro bulbar neuritis.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Ethambutol is an antitubercular medication primarily known for its potential to cause optic nerve toxicity, which can manifest as retro bulbar neuritis. This condition involves inflammation of the optic nerve behind the eyeball, leading to symptoms such as decreased visual acuity and color vision disturbances. The enhanced information supports this by confirming that ethambutol's primary adverse effect is related to the optic nerve. There is no substantial evidence or consensus linking ethambutol to causing deafness, red urine, or peripheral neuritis as primary side effects. Therefore, based on standard medical knowledge and the enhanced information provided, the most likely and consensus-supported adverse effect of ethambutol is retro bulbar neuritis.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
