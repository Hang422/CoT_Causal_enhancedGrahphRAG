Morphine\nopb. Dextromethorphan\nopc. Diphenhydramine\nopd. Aprepitant\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nDextromethorphan is known to cause hallucinations due to its action as an NMDA receptor antagonist, which alters neurotransmission. This aligns with the consensus that NMDA receptor antagonism can lead to dissociative effects, including hallucinations. The evidence path supports this by associating dextromethorphan with NMDA receptors. Morphine, while primarily an opioid receptor agonist, can cause central nervous system effects, including hallucinations, but this is less common and typically associated with higher doses or specific patient susceptibilities. Diphenhydramine, an antihistamine with anticholinergic properties, can cause central nervous system effects such as confusion or hallucinations, particularly in the elderly or at high doses, but this is not its primary effect. Aprepitant, a neurokinin-1 receptor antagonist used as an antiemetic, is unlikely to cause hallucinations, as its primary action does not involve pathways typically associated with such effects. The evidence paths related to aprepitant focus on its antiemetic effects and do not support a link to hallucinations.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "
