Chlorothiazide\nopb. Beta blockers\nopc. ACE inhibitors\nopd. Amlodipine\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nSpironolactone is a potassium-sparing diuretic that can lead to increased potassium levels, posing a risk of hyperkalemia. ACE inhibitors also increase potassium levels, and their concurrent use with spironolactone is contraindicated due to the heightened risk of hyperkalemia. This aligns with the evidence path showing the association between ACE inhibitors and potassium-related complications. Chlorothiazide, a thiazide diuretic, promotes potassium excretion, which may counterbalance spironolactone's effect, making their combination less risky. Beta blockers and amlodipine do not have a direct effect on potassium levels, and there is no significant interaction with spironolactone regarding potassium retention. Therefore, the most contraindicated drug with spironolactone is an ACE inhibitor due to the risk of hyperkalemia.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Spironolactone is a potassium-sparing diuretic, which means it can increase potassium levels in the body. The primary concern with spironolactone is the risk of hyperkalemia, a condition characterized by elevated potassium levels. ACE inhibitors, like spironolactone, also have the potential to increase potassium levels. When used together, the risk of hyperkalemia is significantly heightened, making this combination contraindicated. Chlorothiazide, on the other hand, is a thiazide diuretic that promotes potassium excretion, which can counteract the potassium-retaining effect of spironolactone. Beta blockers and amlodipine do not have a significant impact on potassium levels and are not contraindicated with spironolactone. Therefore, based on the risk of hyperkalemia, the most contraindicated drug with spironolactone is an ACE inhibitor.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opc\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
