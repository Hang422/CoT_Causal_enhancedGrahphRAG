None of the above\nopb. Albumin\nopc. Globulins\nopd. Chylomicrons\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nFree fatty acids are transported in the blood bound to albumin, which is a well-established consensus in biochemistry. Albumin acts as a carrier for free fatty acids, facilitating their transport to cells where they can enter mitochondria for oxidation. The reasoning chain for albumin aligns with this consensus, confirming its role in the transport of free fatty acids. Globulins and chylomicrons do not transport free fatty acids; globulins primarily transport hormones and vitamins, while chylomicrons are involved in the transport of dietary lipids from the intestines. The retrieved evidence paths, although broad, support the role of albumin in association with nonesterified fatty acids, reinforcing the consensus that albumin is the correct transporter in this context.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"In the context of free fatty acid transport for mitochondrial oxidation, the primary medical consensus is that free fatty acids are transported in the blood bound to albumin. Albumin acts as a carrier protein, facilitating the movement of free fatty acids to various tissues, including muscle and liver, where they can be taken up by cells and transported into mitochondria for beta-oxidation. While globulins and chylomicrons have roles in transporting other molecules, they are not involved in the transport of free fatty acids for mitochondrial oxidation. Therefore, based on standard biochemical knowledge and the enhanced information provided, albumin is the correct transporter for free fatty acids in this context.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
