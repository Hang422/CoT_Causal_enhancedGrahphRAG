Protein linked with glycosidic bond\nopb. Core protein\nopc. Sugar residues are long in carbohydrate poion of glycoprotein\nopd. None\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nGlycoproteins are proteins that have carbohydrate groups attached to the polypeptide chain. The attachment is typically through glycosidic bonds, which aligns with option 'opa'. The term 'core protein' in option 'opb' is not a defining characteristic of glycoproteins, as it more commonly refers to the protein component of proteoglycans. Option 'opc' is misleading because glycoproteins generally have short, branched carbohydrate chains, not long ones. The evidence paths indicating glycoproteins are part of cells and interact with proteins support the general role of glycoproteins in cellular functions but do not directly address the specific characteristics in the options. Therefore, the most accurate characteristic of glycoproteins is that they are proteins linked with glycosidic bonds, supporting option 'opa'.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "
