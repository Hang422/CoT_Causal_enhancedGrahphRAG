Salbutamol\nopb. Ketotifen\nopc. Fluticasone\nopd. Monteleukast\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nSalbutamol is a beta adrenergic agonist that causes bronchodilation and is available in aerosol form, making it suitable for the treatment of bronchial asthma. This aligns with the consensus that beta adrenergic agonists are used in inhaled forms for asthma management. Ketotifen is an antihistamine, not a beta adrenergic agonist, and is not typically used as an aerosol for asthma treatment. Fluticasone is a corticosteroid with anti-inflammatory properties, available in aerosol form, but it is not a beta adrenergic agonist; it is used in asthma management for its anti-inflammatory effects. Montelukast is a leukotriene receptor antagonist, administered orally, and not used as an aerosol or a beta adrenergic agonist, making it less likely for direct bronchial asthma treatment. The evidence paths confirm that Salbutamol (Albuterol) interacts with adrenergic beta-agonists, supporting its role in asthma treatment.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The question asks for a beta adrenergic agonist used as an aerosol for the treatment of bronchial asthma. Salbutamol is a well-known beta-2 adrenergic agonist that is commonly used in aerosol form (inhaler) to provide quick relief from bronchospasm in asthma patients. It works by relaxing the muscles in the airways and increasing airflow to the lungs. The other options do not fit the criteria: Ketotifen is an antihistamine, Fluticasone is a corticosteroid, and Montelukast is a leukotriene receptor antagonist. None of these are beta adrenergic agonists, nor are they primarily used as aerosols for immediate bronchodilation. Therefore, based on standard medical knowledge and consensus, Salbutamol is the correct answer.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
