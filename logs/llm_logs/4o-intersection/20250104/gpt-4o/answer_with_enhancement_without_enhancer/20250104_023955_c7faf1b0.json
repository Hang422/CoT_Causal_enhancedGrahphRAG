Methotrexate\nopb. Doxorubicin\nopc. Cisplatin\nopd. Busulfan\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nPulmonary fibrosis is a known complication of certain medications, particularly those with lung toxicity. Methotrexate, an immunosuppressive agent, is associated with potential lung toxicity and can lead to pulmonary fibrosis, supported by its interaction with lung processes. Doxorubicin, primarily known for cardiotoxicity, has less common associations with lung toxicity and pulmonary fibrosis, making it a less likely cause. Cisplatin is primarily associated with nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity, with pulmonary fibrosis being a rare complication. Busulfan, an alkylating agent, is well-documented to cause lung toxicity and is strongly associated with pulmonary fibrosis. The evidence paths confirm the association of alkylating agents like Busulfan with lung processes, supporting its strong link to pulmonary fibrosis. Therefore, Busulfan is the most likely option to cause pulmonary fibrosis, followed by Methotrexate, with Doxorubicin and Cisplatin being less likely.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "
