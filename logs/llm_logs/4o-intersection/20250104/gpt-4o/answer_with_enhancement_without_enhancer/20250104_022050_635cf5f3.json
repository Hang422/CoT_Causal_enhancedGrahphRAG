Drug implicated is?\n\n                    ### Options\n                    opa. Streptomycin\nopb. Isoniazid\nopc. Ethambutol\nopd. Rifampicin\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nStreptomycin is the most likely drug implicated in causing deafness and tinnitus in a patient on anti-tubercular therapy. This aligns with the consensus that streptomycin is known for its ototoxic effects, which can lead to both deafness and tinnitus. The retrieved evidence paths support this by linking streptomycin to ototoxicity, which in turn causes deafness and tinnitus. Other drugs like isoniazid, ethambutol, and rifampicin do not have a direct or strong association with ototoxicity or auditory symptoms. Isoniazid is more commonly associated with peripheral neuropathy, ethambutol with optic neuritis, and rifampicin with hepatotoxicity, none of which directly cause deafness or tinnitus.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"In the context of anti-tubercular therapy, the drug most commonly associated with ototoxicity, which includes symptoms such as deafness and tinnitus, is streptomycin. Streptomycin is an aminoglycoside antibiotic known for its potential to cause damage to the auditory system, leading to these symptoms. Other first-line anti-tubercular drugs like isoniazid, ethambutol, and rifampicin have different side effect profiles: isoniazid is associated with peripheral neuropathy, ethambutol with optic neuritis, and rifampicin with hepatotoxicity. Therefore, based on standard medical knowledge and the enhanced information provided, streptomycin is the most likely drug implicated in causing deafness and tinnitus in this scenario.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
