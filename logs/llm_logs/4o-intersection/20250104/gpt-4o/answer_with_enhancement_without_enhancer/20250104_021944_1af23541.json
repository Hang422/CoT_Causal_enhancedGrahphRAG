Carbamazepine\nopb. Vigabatrin\nopc. Sodium valproate\nopd. Lamotrigine\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nCarbamazepine, sodium valproate, and lamotrigine are all well-established mood stabilizers used in the treatment of bipolar disorder, aligning with standard medical consensus. Vigabatrin, on the other hand, primarily functions as an inhibitor of GABA transaminase, leading to increased GABA levels, but it is not typically used for mood stabilization or the treatment of bipolar disorder. The retrieved evidence paths confirm Vigabatrin's mechanism of action related to GABA but do not support its use in bipolar disorder treatment. Therefore, Vigabatrin is the drug not indicated for bipolar disorder among the options provided.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"In the treatment of bipolar disorder, mood stabilizers are commonly used to manage mood swings and prevent manic and depressive episodes. Carbamazepine, sodium valproate, and lamotrigine are well-established mood stabilizers with evidence supporting their use in bipolar disorder. Carbamazepine and sodium valproate are often used for acute mania and maintenance therapy, while lamotrigine is particularly effective in preventing depressive episodes. Vigabatrin, however, is primarily used as an antiepileptic drug and functions by inhibiting GABA transaminase, increasing GABA levels. It is not indicated for the treatment of bipolar disorder. Therefore, based on standard medical knowledge and consensus, Vigabatrin is the drug not indicated for bipolar disorder among the options provided.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
