Lipase\nopb. Pepsinogens\nopc. HCI\nopd. None\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nThe stomach secretes pepsinogens and hydrochloric acid (HCl), which are essential for protein digestion and creating an acidic environment, respectively. It also secretes gastric lipase, which aids in lipid digestion, although lipase is primarily secreted by the pancreas. The evidence path indicating lipase's role in fat absorption and its primary secretion by the pancreas supports the consensus that while the stomach does secrete some lipase, it is not the main source. Therefore, the correct answer is that lipase is not primarily secreted by the stomach, aligning with the consensus that the pancreas is the main source of lipase.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The stomach is known to secrete pepsinogens and hydrochloric acid (HCl), which are crucial for protein digestion and maintaining an acidic environment. While the stomach does secrete gastric lipase, its role is minor compared to the lipase secreted by the pancreas, which is the primary source for lipid digestion. Therefore, although gastric lipase is secreted by the stomach, it is not the main contributor to lipase activity in the digestive process. Based on this understanding, the most likely correct answer is that lipase is not primarily secreted by the stomach, aligning with the consensus that the pancreas is the main source of lipase.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}",
