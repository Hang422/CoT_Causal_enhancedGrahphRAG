Atrial flutter\nopb. Parkinsonian tremor\nopc. Thyrotoxicosis\nopd. HOCM\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nPropranolol, a non-selective beta-blocker, is effective in managing atrial flutter by decreasing heart rate and controlling arrhythmias, aligning with standard medical consensus. It is also beneficial in thyrotoxicosis by reducing sympathetic overactivity, which is well-supported by clinical practice. However, propranolol is not typically used for Parkinsonian tremor; while beta-blockers can reduce some types of tremor, they are not effective for Parkinsonian tremor, which is primarily due to dopaminergic dysfunction. In hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM), propranolol may worsen outflow obstruction due to its negative inotropic effects, making it less suitable for this condition. Therefore, propranolol is useful in all listed conditions except Parkinsonian tremor, where its efficacy is not supported by consensus or evidence.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "
