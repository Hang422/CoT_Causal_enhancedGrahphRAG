B1\nopb. B2\nopc. B6\nopd. B12\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nWernicke's encephalopathy is primarily associated with a deficiency in vitamin B1, also known as thiamine. This condition is characterized by neurological symptoms such as confusion, ataxia, and ocular abnormalities, which are directly linked to thiamine deficiency. The retrieved evidence paths support this by showing the connection between Wernicke's encephalopathy and thiamine deficiency, often complicated by chronic alcoholism and malnutrition. These factors are well-documented in medical literature as leading to thiamine deficiency, which is the major vitamin deficiency in Wernicke's encephalopathy. Therefore, the correct answer is option A: B1.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "
