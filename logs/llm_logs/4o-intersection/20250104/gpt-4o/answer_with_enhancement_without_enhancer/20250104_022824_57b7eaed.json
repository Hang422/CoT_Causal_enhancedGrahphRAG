Monotherapy for acute episodes\nopb. Monitoring of serum concentration is not useful for guiding dose adjustment\nopc. Can result in leucocytosis\nopd. Can result in hypehyroidism on long term use\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nLithium is commonly used in the management of manic episodes in bipolar disorder, but it is typically not used as monotherapy for acute episodes due to the need for rapid stabilization, often requiring additional medications. Monitoring of serum lithium concentration is crucial for guiding dose adjustment to ensure therapeutic efficacy and avoid toxicity, contradicting the claim that it is not useful. Lithium can indeed cause an increase in white blood cell count, leading to leucocytosis, which is supported by evidence linking lithium to changes in bone marrow activity. Long-term use of lithium is associated with thyroid dysfunction, most commonly resulting in hypothyroidism rather than hyperthyroidism, aligning with standard medical consensus.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

However, it is not typically used as monotherapy for acute episodes due to the need for rapid stabilization, which often requires additional medications. Monitoring serum lithium concentration is crucial for dose adjustment to ensure therapeutic efficacy and avoid toxicity, making option 'opb' incorrect. Lithium is known to cause leucocytosis, which aligns with option 'opc'. Long-term use of lithium is more commonly associated with hypothyroidism rather than hyperthyroidism, making option 'opd' incorrect.
