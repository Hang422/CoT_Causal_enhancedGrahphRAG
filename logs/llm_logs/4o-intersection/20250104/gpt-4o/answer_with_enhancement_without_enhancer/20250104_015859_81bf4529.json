Patient gives history of recurrent bacterial infections. Ophthalmic examination reveals white triangular plaques on conjunctiva. This patient is suffering from deficiency of:\n\n                    ### Options\n                    opa. Vitamin D\nopb. Vitamin B\nopc. Vitamin A\nopd. Vitamin C\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nThe symptoms presented by the patient, including night vision problems, dryness of eyes, recurrent bacterial infections, and the presence of white triangular plaques on the conjunctiva (Bitot's spots), are indicative of Vitamin A deficiency. Vitamin A is crucial for the production of rhodopsin, a pigment necessary for low-light vision, explaining the night blindness. It also plays a role in maintaining healthy epithelial tissues, which is why its deficiency leads to dry eyes and Bitot's spots. Additionally, Vitamin A is important for immune function, and its deficiency can lead to increased susceptibility to infections. The evidence paths support the role of rhodopsin in night blindness and the association of Vitamin A deficiency with immune dysfunction and epithelial abnormalities, confirming the diagnosis of Vitamin A deficiency as the cause of the patient's symptoms.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "
