Outer hair cells in basal area\nopb. Inner hair cells in basal area\nopc. Outer hair cells in apical area\nopd. Inner hair cells in apical area\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nAminoglycosides are known to cause ototoxicity, primarily affecting the cochlear hair cells. The consensus in medical literature indicates that aminoglycosides predominantly damage the outer hair cells, particularly in the basal area of the cochlea. This is because the basal area is more sensitive to the effects of these drugs, leading to high-frequency hearing loss. The retrieved evidence paths support the interaction of ototoxicity with hair cells, confirming the focus on outer hair cells. Inner hair cells are less commonly affected, and damage to the apical area is not typically associated with aminoglycoside ototoxicity. Therefore, the most accurate option is that aminoglycosides affect the outer hair cells in the basal area.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

The consensus in medical literature is that aminoglycosides predominantly affect the outer hair cells in the basal area of the cochlea. This area is more sensitive to the effects of these drugs, leading to high-frequency hearing loss. The basal region of the cochlea is responsible for detecting high-frequency sounds, and damage here is consistent with the clinical presentation of aminoglycoside-induced ototoxicity. Inner hair cells and the apical area are less commonly affected by aminoglycosides. Therefore, the most likely correct option, based on standard medical knowledge and consensus, is that aminoglycosides affect the outer hair cells in the basal area.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
