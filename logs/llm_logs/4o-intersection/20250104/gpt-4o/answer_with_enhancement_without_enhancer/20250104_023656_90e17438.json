Fever\nopb. Peptic ulcer\nopc. Unstable angina\nopd. Myalgia\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nAspirin is contraindicated in peptic ulcer disease due to its inhibition of prostaglandins, which reduces gastric mucosal protection and increases the risk of gastric bleeding. This is supported by evidence showing that gastric hemorrhage can lead to peptic ulcer exacerbation. Aspirin's antiplatelet effect further increases bleeding risk, making it unsuitable for patients with peptic ulcers. While aspirin has antipyretic and anti-inflammatory effects beneficial for managing fever and myalgia, these conditions do not contraindicate its use. Additionally, aspirin's antiplatelet properties are beneficial in preventing clot formation, making it useful rather than contraindicated in unstable angina. Therefore, the primary contraindication for aspirin among the options is peptic ulcer.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Aspirin is known to inhibit the production of prostaglandins, which play a crucial role in protecting the gastric mucosa. This inhibition can lead to increased gastric acid secretion and reduced mucosal protection, heightening the risk of gastric bleeding and ulcer formation. Therefore, aspirin is contraindicated in individuals with peptic ulcer disease due to the increased risk of exacerbating the condition and causing gastrointestinal bleeding. In contrast, aspirin is not contraindicated in conditions like fever, myalgia, or unstable angina. In fact, its antiplatelet effects are beneficial in managing unstable angina by preventing clot formation. Thus, the most likely correct answer, based on standard medical knowledge and consensus, is that aspirin is contraindicated in peptic ulcer disease.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
