Hyponatremia\nopb. Hyperkalemia\nopc. Hypoglycemia\nopd. Metabolic alkalosis\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nAdrenal insufficiency is characterized by decreased production of aldosterone and cortisol. This leads to hyponatremia due to decreased sodium reabsorption and hyperkalemia due to decreased potassium excretion, both of which are consistent with the condition. Additionally, decreased cortisol results in reduced gluconeogenesis, leading to hypoglycemia. However, adrenal insufficiency is associated with metabolic acidosis due to decreased hydrogen ion excretion, not metabolic alkalosis. Therefore, metabolic alkalosis is not associated with adrenal insufficiency. The evidence paths support the role of aldosterone in potassium and sodium balance, confirming the consensus that adrenal insufficiency leads to hyperkalemia and hyponatremia, but not metabolic alkalosis.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Adrenal insufficiency, characterized by decreased production of aldosterone and cortisol, leads to several electrolyte and metabolic disturbances. The lack of aldosterone results in hyponatremia due to decreased sodium reabsorption and hyperkalemia due to decreased potassium excretion. The deficiency in cortisol reduces gluconeogenesis, causing hypoglycemia. Metabolic acidosis, not alkalosis, is associated with adrenal insufficiency due to decreased hydrogen ion excretion. Therefore, metabolic alkalosis is not a feature of adrenal insufficiency. This aligns with standard medical knowledge and consensus.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
