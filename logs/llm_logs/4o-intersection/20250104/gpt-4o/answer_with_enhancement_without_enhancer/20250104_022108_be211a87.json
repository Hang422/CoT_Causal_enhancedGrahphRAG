Erythromycin\nopb. Benzene hexachloride\nopc. Piperazine\nopd. Thiabendazole\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nScabies is a skin infestation caused by the mite Sarcoptes scabiei. The standard treatment for scabies involves topical scabicides. Erythromycin is an antibiotic effective against bacterial infections, not scabies, and thus is not suitable for treating scabies. Benzene hexachloride, also known as Lindane, is a topical scabicide that effectively kills scabies mites, making it a suitable treatment. Piperazine and Thiabendazole are anthelmintics used to treat worm infections and are not effective against scabies mites. The evidence paths provided do not directly support the treatment of scabies but confirm the roles of Piperazine and Thiabendazole as anthelmintics, which aligns with the consensus that they are not used for scabies treatment. Therefore, Benzene hexachloride is the correct treatment option for scabies.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "
