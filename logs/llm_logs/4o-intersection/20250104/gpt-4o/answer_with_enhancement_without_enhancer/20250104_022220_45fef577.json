Propanolol\nopb. Aiprazolam\nopc. Buspirone\nopd. Haloperidol\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nPropranolol is a beta-blocker that can be used off-label for anxiety, particularly for physical symptoms like tremors and palpitations, but it is not primarily an anxiolytic. Alprazolam is a benzodiazepine and is widely used for treating anxiety disorders, supported by its classification and evidence paths. Buspirone is an anxiolytic specifically used for anxiety, aligning with both its classification and evidence paths. Haloperidol is an antipsychotic and is not typically used for anxiety, which is consistent with its classification and the evidence paths. Therefore, Haloperidol is the drug not used for anxiety in the context of this question.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"In the context of treating anxiety, propranolol is sometimes used off-label to manage physical symptoms associated with anxiety, such as tremors and palpitations, but it is not primarily an anxiolytic. Alprazolam is a benzodiazepine and is commonly prescribed for anxiety disorders due to its anxiolytic properties. Buspirone is specifically indicated for the treatment of anxiety, making it a direct anxiolytic. Haloperidol, on the other hand, is an antipsychotic medication primarily used for the treatment of schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders. It is not typically used for anxiety, as its pharmacological action is not aligned with the treatment of anxiety symptoms. Therefore, based on standard medical knowledge and consensus, Haloperidol is the drug not used for anxiety.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
