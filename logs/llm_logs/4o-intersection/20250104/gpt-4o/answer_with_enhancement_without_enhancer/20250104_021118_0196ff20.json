Ototoxicity\nopb. Nephrotoxicity\nopc. Coasting effect\nopd. Pulmonary fibrosis\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nCisplatin is well-documented to cause ototoxicity, leading to hearing loss, and nephrotoxicity, resulting in kidney damage, both supported by strong clinical evidence. The 'coasting effect' refers to a delayed neuropathy that can occur with some chemotherapeutic agents, but it is not a well-established side effect of Cisplatin. Pulmonary fibrosis is not commonly associated with Cisplatin; the evidence path suggesting a link is broad and lacks direct support. Therefore, among the options, pulmonary fibrosis is the side effect not typically produced by Cisplatin.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Cisplatin is a chemotherapy drug known for its side effects, including ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity, which are well-documented and widely recognized. The 'coasting effect' is associated with some chemotherapeutic agents, but it is not a prominent or well-established side effect of Cisplatin. Pulmonary fibrosis, on the other hand, is not commonly linked to Cisplatin use. While some chemotherapeutic agents can cause pulmonary fibrosis, Cisplatin is not typically one of them. Therefore, based on standard medical knowledge and consensus, pulmonary fibrosis is the side effect not typically produced by Cisplatin.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
