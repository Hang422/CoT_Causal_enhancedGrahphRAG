Striated\nopb. Large T tubules\nopc. Troponin system present\nopd. Caldesmon is impoant regulatory protein\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nCardiac muscle is characterized by a striated appearance, similar to skeletal muscle, due to the arrangement of actin and myosin filaments. It also features large T tubules, which are crucial for efficient calcium handling, facilitating rapid transmission of action potentials and synchronized contraction. The troponin system is present in cardiac muscle, playing a key role in the regulation of contraction by binding calcium and initiating the interaction between actin and myosin. However, caldesmon is not an important regulatory protein in cardiac muscle; it is more relevant in smooth muscle regulation. The retrieved evidence paths are not directly relevant to cardiac muscle regulation and should not influence the assessment of these features.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Cardiac muscle is known for its striated appearance due to the organized arrangement of actin and myosin filaments, similar to skeletal muscle, which confirms option 'opa' as a feature. Large T tubules are indeed present in cardiac muscle, facilitating efficient calcium handling and rapid action potential transmission, supporting option 'opb'. The troponin system is a critical component in cardiac muscle contraction regulation, confirming option 'opc'. Caldesmon, however, is primarily associated with smooth muscle regulation and is not a significant regulatory protein in cardiac muscle, making option 'opd' the correct choice for the feature that does not belong to cardiac muscle.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
