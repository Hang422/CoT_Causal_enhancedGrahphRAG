Stagnant hypoxia\nopb. Anemic hypoxia\nopc. Hypoxic hypoxia\nopd. Histotoxic hypoxia\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nShock is primarily associated with stagnant hypoxia due to decreased blood flow and reduced oxygen delivery to tissues, aligning with the consensus that shock leads to impaired circulation. This is supported by evidence paths indicating shock's impact on blood circulation. Anemic hypoxia can occur in shock due to blood loss and reduced hemoglobin levels, but it is less directly linked than stagnant hypoxia. Hypoxic hypoxia, characterized by impaired oxygen delivery, is a possible but less common outcome of shock, as shock typically affects circulation rather than oxygen availability. Histotoxic hypoxia, where cells cannot utilize oxygen despite normal delivery, is not typically caused by shock, as shock does not usually affect cellular oxygen utilization directly. Therefore, stagnant hypoxia is the most directly related to shock.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Shock is a condition characterized by inadequate tissue perfusion and oxygenation due to impaired circulation. The primary type of hypoxia associated with shock is stagnant hypoxia, which occurs when there is a reduction in blood flow, leading to decreased oxygen delivery to tissues. This aligns with the consensus that shock primarily affects circulation, resulting in stagnant hypoxia. While anemic hypoxia can occur in cases of shock involving significant blood loss, it is not as directly linked to the general mechanism of shock as stagnant hypoxia. Hypoxic hypoxia and histotoxic hypoxia are less commonly associated with shock, as they involve different mechanisms of impaired oxygen delivery or utilization. Therefore, stagnant hypoxia is the most directly related to the pathophysiology of shock.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}\n```",
