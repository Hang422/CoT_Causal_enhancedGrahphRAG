Thiamine\nopb. Pyridoxine\nopc. Niacin\nopd. Riboflavin\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nINH (isoniazid) is known to interfere with pyridoxine (vitamin B6) metabolism, leading to pyridoxine deficiency. This deficiency can cause peripheral neuropathy. The standard treatment for INH-induced neuropathy is supplementation with pyridoxine, which corrects the deficiency and alleviates symptoms. The retrieved evidence paths support this by indicating that vitamin B6 deficiency causes neuropathy and that pyridoxine treats neuropathy. Therefore, the correct treatment for INH-induced neuropathy is pyridoxine supplementation.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"INH (isoniazid) is an antibiotic commonly used in the treatment of tuberculosis. One of its known side effects is peripheral neuropathy, which occurs due to the drug's interference with pyridoxine (vitamin B6) metabolism. This interference can lead to a deficiency in pyridoxine, which is essential for nerve function. The standard medical treatment for INH-induced neuropathy is supplementation with pyridoxine to correct the deficiency and alleviate symptoms. This approach is widely supported by medical consensus and aligns with the enhanced information provided, which confirms that pyridoxine is the appropriate treatment for this condition.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
