Cinchonism\nopb. Hyperglycemia\nopc. Hypoglycemia\nopd. Hypokalemia\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nQuinine is known to cause hypoglycemia due to increased insulin secretion, which can lead to symptoms like sweating and palpitation. This aligns with the consensus that hypoglycemia is a likely cause of these symptoms in patients treated with quinine. While quinine can have cardiac effects, the specific symptoms of sweating and palpitation are more directly linked to hypoglycemia rather than cinchonism, which typically involves tinnitus, headache, and dizziness. The evidence paths related to metabolic effects and electrolyte imbalances are broad, but they do not directly support hyperglycemia or hypokalemia as primary causes in this context. Therefore, hypoglycemia is the most supported explanation for the symptoms observed in the patient.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "
