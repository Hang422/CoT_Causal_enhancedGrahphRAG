Directly\nopb. IG1-1\nopc. Thyroxine\nopd. Intranuclear receptors\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nGrowth hormone primarily exerts its effects on growth through the production of Insulin-Like Growth Factor 1 (IGF-1) in the liver. This is a well-established mechanism where growth hormone stimulates the liver to produce IGF-1, which then acts on various tissues to promote bone growth, muscle growth, and cell proliferation, leading to overall growth effects. The retrieved evidence paths support this interaction between somatotropin (growth hormone) and IGF-1. While growth hormone may have some direct effects, these are not the primary mechanism for growth. The interaction with thyroxine and intranuclear receptors is not a significant pathway for growth hormone's effects on growth. Therefore, the consensus is that growth hormone's effects on growth are mediated through IGF-1.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "
