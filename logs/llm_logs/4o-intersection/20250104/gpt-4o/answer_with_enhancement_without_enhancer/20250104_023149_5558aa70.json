Propanolol\nopb. Oral contraceptives\nopc. Reserpine\nopd. Flupenthixol\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nPropranolol, a beta-blocker, is known to have central nervous system effects, including the potential to cause depression, aligning with the consensus that beta-blockers can affect mood. Oral contraceptives can lead to hormonal changes that may result in mood alterations, including depression, which is consistent with known side effects. Reserpine depletes monoamines such as serotonin, which is strongly associated with causing depression, confirming the high likelihood of this side effect. Flupenthixol, an antipsychotic and dopamine receptor antagonist, is generally used to improve mood and is not typically associated with causing depression. The evidence paths support the role of antipsychotic agents like Flupenthixol in mood improvement, reinforcing that it is not linked to depression. Therefore, depression is not a side effect of Flupenthixol.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"To determine which medication does not have depression as a side effect, we need to evaluate each option based on their known pharmacological effects. Propranolol, a beta-blocker, is known to potentially cause depression due to its central nervous system effects. Oral contraceptives can alter hormone levels, which may lead to mood changes, including depression. Reserpine depletes monoamines like serotonin, which is directly linked to causing depression. Flupenthixol, on the other hand, is an antipsychotic that is often used to improve mood and is not typically associated with causing depression. Therefore, based on standard medical knowledge and the enhanced information provided, Flupenthixol is the most likely option that does not have depression as a side effect.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}\n```",
