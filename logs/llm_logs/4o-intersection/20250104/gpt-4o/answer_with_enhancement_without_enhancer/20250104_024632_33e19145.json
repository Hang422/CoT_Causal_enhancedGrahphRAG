HGPRTase\nopb. Adenosine deaminase\nopc. APRTase\nopd. Acid maltase\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nHGPRTase deficiency is associated with the accumulation of uric acid, leading to gout-like symptoms and neurological issues, which aligns with the symptoms of Lesch-Nyhan syndrome. Adenosine deaminase deficiency results in the accumulation of toxic metabolites causing severe combined immunodeficiency, characterized by recurrent infections. APRTase deficiency leads to the accumulation of adenine and the formation of 2,8-dihydroxyadenine stones, resulting in kidney stones. Acid maltase deficiency, also known as Pompe disease, causes glycogen accumulation in lysosomes, leading to muscle weakness and cardiomyopathy. The retrieved evidence paths support the link between glycogen accumulation and cardiomyopathy, confirming the symptoms associated with acid maltase deficiency. Based on the symptoms described, the most likely enzyme deficiency in this child is HGPRTase, given the neurological and gout-like symptoms typical of Lesch-Nyhan syndrome.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "
