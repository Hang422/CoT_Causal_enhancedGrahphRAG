This hormone is:\n\n                    ### Options\n                    opa. Endothelial growth factor (EGF)\nopb. Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG)\nopc. Human chorionic somatotropin (HCS)\nopd. Relaxin\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nThe hormone secreted by the placenta that is utilized in the early detection of pregnancy is human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). This is supported by the consensus that hCG is produced by the placenta shortly after implantation and is detectable in both blood and urine, making it the primary hormone used in pregnancy tests. The reasoning chains correctly identify hCG as the hormone linked to early pregnancy detection, as it rises significantly in early pregnancy and is the target of most pregnancy tests. The retrieved evidence paths, while broad, confirm that hCG interacts with cells and is part of blood, which aligns with its role in early pregnancy detection through blood tests. Other options, such as endothelial growth factor (EGF), human chorionic somatotropin (HCS), and relaxin, do not play a primary role in early pregnancy detection.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "
