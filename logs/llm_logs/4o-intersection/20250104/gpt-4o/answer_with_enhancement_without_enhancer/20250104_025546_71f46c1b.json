Vitamin B9\nopb. Vitamin B12\nopc. Vitamin B6\nopd. Vitamin B3\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nIsoniazid is known to interfere with pyridoxine (Vitamin B6) metabolism, leading to a deficiency in Vitamin B6. This is due to isoniazid's role as a pyridoxine antagonist and its ability to increase the excretion of pyridoxine. The retrieved evidence paths, while broad, support the consensus that pyridoxine (Vitamin B6) is directly related to isoniazid treatment, as pyridoxine is used to treat Vitamin B6 deficiency. Therefore, among the options provided, Vitamin B6 deficiency is the most likely to be seen in patients on isoniazid.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Isoniazid is an antibiotic commonly used in the treatment of tuberculosis. It is well-documented in medical literature that isoniazid can lead to a deficiency in Vitamin B6 (pyridoxine). This occurs because isoniazid acts as a pyridoxine antagonist, interfering with its metabolism and increasing its excretion. As a result, patients on isoniazid therapy are often supplemented with Vitamin B6 to prevent deficiency-related complications such as peripheral neuropathy. The enhanced information aligns with the standard medical consensus that Vitamin B6 deficiency is the most likely to be seen in patients taking isoniazid.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opc\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
