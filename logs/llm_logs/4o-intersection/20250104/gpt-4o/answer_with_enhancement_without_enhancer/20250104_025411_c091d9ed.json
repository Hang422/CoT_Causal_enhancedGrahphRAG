Glucocoicoids\nopb. Mineralcoicoids\nopc. Aldosterone\nopd. Androgens\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nThe zona reticularis of the adrenal cortex primarily secretes androgens, which is supported by the consensus that this layer is responsible for the production of these hormones. The retrieved evidence paths confirm that androgens are located in the zona reticularis and are classified as hormones, aligning with the consensus. While the zona reticularis may produce some glucocorticoids, this is not its primary function, and it does not produce mineralocorticoids or aldosterone, which are primarily associated with other zones of the adrenal cortex. Therefore, the major hormone secreted by the zona reticularis is androgens.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The adrenal cortex is divided into three zones, each responsible for producing different types of hormones. The zona glomerulosa primarily secretes mineralocorticoids, such as aldosterone. The zona fasciculata primarily secretes glucocorticoids, such as cortisol. The zona reticularis, the innermost layer, primarily secretes androgens. While there may be some overlap in hormone production among these zones, the primary function of the zona reticularis is the production of androgens. This is supported by standard medical knowledge and consensus, which aligns with the enhanced information provided.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
