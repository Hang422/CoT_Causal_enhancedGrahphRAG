It is a H2 blocker used in peptic ulcer disease\nopb. It has 100% Bioavailability\nopc. It also enhances gastric emptying\nopd. It can also lead to tachycardia\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nNizatidine is a histamine H2 receptor antagonist (H2 blocker) commonly used in the treatment of peptic ulcer disease, which aligns with standard medical consensus and is supported by evidence paths showing its role in preventing peptic ulcers. It does not have 100% bioavailability; its bioavailability is typically around 70%, contradicting the claim of 100% bioavailability. There is no strong consensus or evidence supporting the claim that Nizatidine enhances gastric emptying, making this statement questionable. While tachycardia is not a common side effect of Nizatidine, it is possible as a rare side effect, but this is not well-documented in standard references. Therefore, the statement about 100% bioavailability is the exception among the options provided.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "
