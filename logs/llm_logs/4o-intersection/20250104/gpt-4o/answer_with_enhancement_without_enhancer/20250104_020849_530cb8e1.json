PAS\nopb. Ethionamide\nopc. Cycloserine\nopd. Pyrazinamide\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nEthionamide is known to inhibit thyroid hormone synthesis, which can lead to reduced thyroid hormone levels and potentially cause hypothyroidism. This aligns with the consensus that ethionamide can affect thyroid function and lead to hypothyroidism. The evidence paths related to ethionamide's association with thyroid hormones support this reasoning. PAS has a possible but unclear impact on thyroid function, and there is no strong consensus or evidence linking it directly to hypothyroidism. Cycloserine and pyrazinamide have no known effects on thyroid function and are unlikely to cause hypothyroidism, as supported by the lack of relevant evidence paths. Therefore, ethionamide is the most likely anti-tubercular drug to cause hypothyroidism.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "
