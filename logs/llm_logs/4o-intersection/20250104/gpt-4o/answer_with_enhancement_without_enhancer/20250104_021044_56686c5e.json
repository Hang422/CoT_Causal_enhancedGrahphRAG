It is an enzyme inducer\nopb. It causes obesity\nopc. It causes Hirsutism\nopd. It causes neural tube defects\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nValproic acid is known to be an enzyme inhibitor, not an inducer, which aligns with the evidence path indicating it is an enzyme inhibitor. Therefore, option 'opa' is correct as the exception. Valproic acid can cause weight gain, which may lead to obesity, supporting option 'opb'. While hormonal changes due to valproic acid could theoretically lead to hirsutism, this is not a well-documented or common side effect, making option 'opc' less supported. Valproic acid is a known teratogen and can cause neural tube defects, as confirmed by the evidence path linking it to teratogenesis, supporting option 'opd'. Thus, the correct answer is that valproic acid is not an enzyme inducer.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Valproic acid is primarily known as an enzyme inhibitor, not an inducer, which directly contradicts option 'opa'. This aligns with standard pharmacological knowledge. Valproic acid is associated with weight gain, which can lead to obesity, supporting option 'opb'. While hirsutism is not a commonly documented side effect of valproic acid, it is theoretically possible due to hormonal changes, but not strongly supported, making option 'opc' less likely. Valproic acid is a well-known teratogen and is associated with neural tube defects, supporting option 'opd'. Therefore, the most likely correct answer is that valproic acid is not an enzyme inducer.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
