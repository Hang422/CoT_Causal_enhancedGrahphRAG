      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Antidepressant drug that can be used in nocturnal enuresis is?\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Imipramine\nopb. Fluvoxamine\nopc. Phenelzine\nopd. Bupropion\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Imipramine\" -> \"tricyclic antidepressant\" -> \"anticholinergic effects\" -> \"reduced bladder contractions\" -> \"decreased nocturnal enuresis\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Fluvoxamine\" -> \"SSRI\" -> \"increased serotonin\" -> \"no direct effect on bladder\" -> \"unlikely to treat nocturnal enuresis\" -> 20%\nCHAIN: \"Phenelzine\" -> \"MAOI\" -> \"increased monoamines\" -> \"no direct effect on bladder\" -> \"unlikely to treat nocturnal enuresis\" -> 15%\nCHAIN: \"Bupropion\" -> \"NDRI\" -> \"increased norepinephrine and dopamine\" -> \"no direct effect on bladder\" -> \"unlikely to treat nocturnal enuresis\" -> 25%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Contraction)-PREDISPOSES->(Bedwetting)\n(Norepinephrine)-CAUSES->(Muscle Contraction)-PROCESS_OF->(Bladder)\n(Norepinephrine)-CAUSES->(Vascular resistance)-PROCESS_OF->(Bladder)\n(Dopamine)-CAUSES->(Vasodilation)-PROCESS_OF->(Bladder)\n(Imipramine)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Antidepressive Agents)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Antidepressive Agents, Tricyclic)\n(Imipramine)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Antipsychotic Agents)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Antidepressive Agents, Tricyclic)\n(Bladder)-LOCATION_OF->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-CAUSES->(Bedwetting)\n(Bladder)-LOCATION_OF->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-TREATS->(Bedwetting)\n(Bladder)-LOCATION_OF->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-CAUSES->(Bedwetting)\n(Bladder)-LOCATION_OF->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-TREATS->(Bedwetting)\n(Bladder)-LOCATION_OF->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-CAUSES->(Bedwetting)\n(Bladder)-LOCATION_OF->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-TREATS->(Bedwetting)\n(Bladder)-LOCATION_OF->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-CAUSES->(Bedwetting)\n(Bladder)-LOCATION_OF->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-TREATS->(Bedwetting)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Imipramine is a tricyclic antidepressant known for its anticholinergic effects, which can reduce bladder contractions and thereby decrease nocturnal enuresis. This aligns with the consensus that Imipramine is used in treating nocturnal enuresis due to its ability to affect bladder function. The evidence paths support this by showing Imipramine's interaction with tricyclic antidepressants, which are known to treat bedwetting. In contrast, Fluvoxamine, Phenelzine, and Bupropion do not have direct effects on bladder function and are unlikely to be effective for nocturnal enuresis. Fluvoxamine is an SSRI, Phenelzine is an MAOI, and Bupropion is an NDRI, none of which are typically used for this condition. Therefore, Imipramine is the most appropriate choice for treating nocturnal enuresis among the options provided.\"\n}\n```",
