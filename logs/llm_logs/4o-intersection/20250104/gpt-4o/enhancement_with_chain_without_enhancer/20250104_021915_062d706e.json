      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Which of the following drugs is useful in prophylaxis of motion sickness?\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Hyoscine\nopb. Metoclopramide\nopc. Prochlorperazine\nopd. Ondansetron\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Hyoscine\" -> \"anticholinergic effect\" -> \"inhibits vestibular system\" -> \"prevents motion sickness\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Metoclopramide\" -> \"dopamine antagonist\" -> \"acts on chemoreceptor trigger zone\" -> \"reduces nausea\" -> \"not specific for motion sickness\" -> 60%\nCHAIN: \"Prochlorperazine\" -> \"dopamine antagonist\" -> \"acts on chemoreceptor trigger zone\" -> \"reduces nausea\" -> \"not specific for motion sickness\" -> 60%\nCHAIN: \"Ondansetron\" -> \"serotonin antagonist\" -> \"acts on chemoreceptor trigger zone\" -> \"reduces nausea\" -> \"not specific for motion sickness\" -> 60%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Nausea)-CAUSES->(Motion Sickness)\n(Nausea)-CAUSES->(Motion Sickness)\n(Nausea)-CAUSES->(Motion Sickness)\n(Vestibular system)-LOCATION_OF->(Exploration procedure)-PREVENTS->(Motion Sickness)\n(Vestibular system)-LOCATION_OF->(Electric Stimulation)-PREVENTS->(Motion Sickness)\n(Metoclopramide)-TREATS->(Functional disorder)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(physiological aspects)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Dopamine Antagonists)\n(Metoclopramide)-TREATS->(Epilepsy)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(physiological aspects)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Dopamine Antagonists)\n(Prochlorperazine)-TREATS->(Pain)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(physiological aspects)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Dopamine Antagonists)\n(Prochlorperazine)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Pain)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(physiological aspects)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Dopamine Antagonists)\n(Ondansetron)-TREATS->(Disease)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Sleep, Slow-Wave)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Serotonin Antagonists)\n(Ondansetron)-ISA->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Serotonin Uptake Inhibitors)-ISA->(Serotonin Antagonists)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Hyoscine, also known as scopolamine, is an anticholinergic drug that effectively prevents motion sickness by inhibiting the vestibular system, which is responsible for balance and spatial orientation. This aligns with the consensus that anticholinergics are effective in motion sickness prophylaxis. Metoclopramide, Prochlorperazine, and Ondansetron are primarily used to treat nausea and vomiting by acting on the chemoreceptor trigger zone, but they are not specifically effective for motion sickness. The evidence paths confirm that the vestibular system's inhibition is key in preventing motion sickness, supporting the use of Hyoscine for this purpose. Therefore, Hyoscine is the most appropriate choice for the prophylaxis of motion sickness.\"\n}\n```",
