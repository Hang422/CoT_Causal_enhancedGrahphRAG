      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Physiology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Growth hormone has its effect on growth through?\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Directly\nopb. IG1-1\nopc. Thyroxine\nopd. Intranuclear receptors\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Growth hormone\" -> \"liver\" -> \"IGF-1 production\" -> \"growth effects\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Growth hormone\" -> \"IGF-1\" -> \"bone growth\" -> \"increased height\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Growth hormone\" -> \"IGF-1\" -> \"muscle growth\" -> \"increased muscle mass\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Growth hormone\" -> \"IGF-1\" -> \"cell proliferation\" -> \"tissue growth\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Growth hormone\" -> \"possible direct effects\" -> \"unclear significance\" -> 60%\nCHAIN: \"Growth hormone\" -> \"possible interaction with thyroxine\" -> \"unclear growth effect\" -> 50%\nCHAIN: \"Growth hormone\" -> \"intranuclear receptors\" -> \"unclear mechanism\" -> 40%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Somatotropin)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cells)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Insulin-Like Growth Factor I)\n(Somatotropin)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cells)-LOCATION_OF->(Insulin-Like Growth Factor I)\n(Somatotropin)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cells)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Insulin-Like Growth Factor I)\n(Somatotropin)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cells)-LOCATION_OF->(Insulin-Like Growth Factor I)\n(Somatotropin)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cells)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Insulin-Like Growth Factor I)\n(Somatotropin)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cells)-LOCATION_OF->(Insulin-Like Growth Factor I)\n(Somatotropin)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cells)-LOCATION_OF->(Thyroxine)\n(Somatotropin)-PREDISPOSES->(Pathogenesis)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Thyroxine)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Growth hormone primarily exerts its effects on growth through the production of Insulin-Like Growth Factor 1 (IGF-1) in the liver. This is a well-established mechanism where growth hormone stimulates the liver to produce IGF-1, which then acts on various tissues to promote bone growth, muscle growth, and cell proliferation, leading to overall growth effects. The retrieved evidence paths support this interaction between somatotropin (growth hormone) and IGF-1. While growth hormone may have some direct effects, these are not the primary mechanism for growth. The interaction with thyroxine and intranuclear receptors is not a significant pathway for growth hormone's effects on growth. Therefore, the consensus is that growth hormone's effects on growth are mediated through IGF-1.\"\n}\n```",
