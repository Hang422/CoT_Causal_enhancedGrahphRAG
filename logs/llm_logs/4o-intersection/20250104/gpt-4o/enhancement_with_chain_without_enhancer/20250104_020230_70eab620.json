      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4.

Acute renal failure\nopb. Development of antiplatelet antibodies\nopc. Encephalitis secondary to liver dysfunction\nopd. Hemorrhagic stroke\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Fibrinolytic drug\" -> \"dissolution of blood clots\" -> \"systemic fibrinolysis\" -> \"increased bleeding risk\" -> \"hemorrhagic stroke\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Fibrinolytic drug\" -> \"activation of plasminogen\" -> \"plasmin formation\" -> \"degradation of fibrin\" -> \"bleeding complications\" -> \"hemorrhagic stroke\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Fibrinolytic drug\" -> \"systemic activation of fibrinolysis\" -> \"reduced clot stability\" -> \"bleeding in vulnerable areas\" -> \"hemorrhagic stroke\" -> 92%\nCHAIN: \"Fibrinolytic drug\" -> \"increased bleeding tendency\" -> \"intracranial bleeding\" -> \"hemorrhagic stroke\" -> 93%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Fibrinolytic Agents)-CAUSES->(Thrombus)\n(Hemorrhage)-CAUSES->(Subarachnoid Hemorrhage)-CAUSES->(Hemorrhagic Stroke)\n(Hemorrhage)-CAUSES->(Disease)-PREDISPOSES->(Hemorrhagic Stroke)\n(Hemorrhage)-CAUSES->(Cerebral Infarction)-PREDISPOSES->(Hemorrhagic Stroke)\n(Complication)-CAUSES->(Hemorrhagic Stroke)\n(Fibrinolytic Agents)-CAUSES->(Thrombus)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Fibrinolysis)\n(Fibrinolytic Agents)-PREVENTS->(Venous Thrombosis)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Fibrinolysis)\n(Fibrinolytic Agents)-TREATS->(COVID-19)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Fibrinolysis)\n(Hemorrhage)-CAUSES->(Subarachnoid Hemorrhage)-CAUSES->(Hemorrhagic Stroke)\n(Hemorrhage)-CAUSES->(Disease)-PREDISPOSES->(Hemorrhagic Stroke)\n(Hemorrhage)-CAUSES->(Cerebral Infarction)-PREDISPOSES->(Hemorrhagic Stroke)\n(Fibrinolytic Agents)-CAUSES->(Hemorrhage)\n(Hemorrhage)-CAUSES->(Intracranial Hemorrhages)\n(Intracranial Hemorrhages)-PREDISPOSES->(Hemorrhagic Stroke)\n(Fibrinolytic Agents)-PREVENTS->(Inflammation)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Plasminogen)\n(Fibrinolytic Agents)-TREATS->(Inflammation)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Plasminogen)\n(Plasminogen)-TREATS->(Pathogenesis)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Plasmin)\n(Plasminogen)-TREATS->(Inflammation)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Plasmin)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Fibrinolytic drugs, used to dissolve blood clots, increase the risk of bleeding due to systemic fibrinolysis. This increased bleeding risk can lead to hemorrhagic stroke, which is a well-documented adverse effect. The reasoning chains correctly identify the process: fibrinolytic drugs activate plasminogen, leading to plasmin formation and fibrin degradation, which can result in bleeding complications, including hemorrhagic stroke. The retrieved evidence paths support this by linking fibrinolytic agents to hemorrhage and hemorrhagic stroke. Other options, such as acute renal failure, development of antiplatelet antibodies, and encephalitis secondary to liver dysfunction, are not commonly associated with fibrinolytic therapy. Therefore, the most likely adverse effect of fibrinolytic drugs in the treatment of acute myocardial infarction is hemorrhagic stroke.\"\n}\n```",
