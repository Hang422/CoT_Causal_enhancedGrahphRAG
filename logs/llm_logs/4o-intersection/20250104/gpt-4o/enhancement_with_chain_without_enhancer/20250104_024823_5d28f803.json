      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Which of the following drugs is used to treat both diabetes mellitus and diabetes insipidus\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Chlorpropamide\nopb. Glibenclamide\nopc. Glicazide\nopd. Glipizide\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Chlorpropamide\" -> \"sulfonylurea class\" -> \"stimulates insulin release\" -> \"treats type 2 diabetes mellitus\" -> \"antidiuretic effect\" -> \"treats diabetes insipidus\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Glibenclamide\" -> \"sulfonylurea class\" -> \"stimulates insulin release\" -> \"treats type 2 diabetes mellitus\" -> \"no known effect on diabetes insipidus\" -> 40%\nCHAIN: \"Glicazide\" -> \"sulfonylurea class\" -> \"stimulates insulin release\" -> \"treats type 2 diabetes mellitus\" -> \"no known effect on diabetes insipidus\" -> 40%\nCHAIN: \"Glipizide\" -> \"sulfonylurea class\" -> \"stimulates insulin release\" -> \"treats type 2 diabetes mellitus\" -> \"no known effect on diabetes insipidus\" -> 40%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Insulin)-CAUSES->(Diabetes Mellitus, Non-Insulin-Dependent)\n(Insulin)-CAUSES->(Diabetes Mellitus, Non-Insulin-Dependent)\n(Diabetes Mellitus, Non-Insulin-Dependent)-CAUSES->(Disease)-CAUSES->(Diabetes Insipidus)\n(Insulin)-CAUSES->(Diabetes Mellitus, Non-Insulin-Dependent)\n(Diabetes Mellitus, Non-Insulin-Dependent)-CAUSES->(Disease)-CAUSES->(Diabetes Insipidus)\n(Insulin)-CAUSES->(Diabetes Mellitus, Non-Insulin-Dependent)\n(Diabetes Mellitus, Non-Insulin-Dependent)-CAUSES->(Disease)-CAUSES->(Diabetes Insipidus)\n(Antidiuretic Effect)-PROCESS_OF->(Kidney)-LOCATION_OF->(Disease)-COMPLICATES->(Diabetes Insipidus)\n(Antidiuretic Effect)-PROCESS_OF->(Kidney)-LOCATION_OF->(Disease)-PREDISPOSES->(Diabetes Insipidus)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Chlorpropamide is a sulfonylurea drug that stimulates insulin release, making it effective in treating type 2 diabetes mellitus. Additionally, it has an antidiuretic effect, which can be beneficial in treating diabetes insipidus, although this use is less common and not a primary indication. The other options, Glibenclamide, Glicazide, and Glipizide, are also sulfonylureas used to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus by stimulating insulin release, but they do not have a known effect on diabetes insipidus. Therefore, Chlorpropamide is the only drug among the options that is used to treat both diabetes mellitus and diabetes insipidus, aligning with the consensus that it has a unique antidiuretic property among sulfonylureas.\"\n}\n```",
