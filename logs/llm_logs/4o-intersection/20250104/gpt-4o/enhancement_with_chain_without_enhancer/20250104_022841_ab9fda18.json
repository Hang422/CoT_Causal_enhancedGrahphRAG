      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        A Patient who is on antihypertensive drug develops a dry cough. Which of the following drug might be responsible for the condition:\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Diuretics\nopb. ACE inhibitors\nopc. Calcium channel blockers\nopd. Beta blockers\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"ACE inhibitors\" -> \"increased bradykinin\" -> \"dry cough\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Diuretics\" -> \"possible electrolyte imbalance\" -> \"unclear relation to dry cough\" -> 40%\nCHAIN: \"Calcium channel blockers\" -> \"vasodilation\" -> \"unclear relation to dry cough\" -> 30%\nCHAIN: \"Beta blockers\" -> \"bronchoconstriction\" -> \"possible cough\" -> 50%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Bradykinin)-CAUSES->(Symptoms)-CAUSES->(Non-productive cough)\n(Bradykinin)-CAUSES->(Coughing)-CAUSES->(Non-productive cough)\n(Bradykinin)-TREATS->(Disease)-CAUSES->(Non-productive cough)\n(Electrolytes)-COMPLICATES->(Disease)-CAUSES->(Non-productive cough)\n(Electrolytes)-TREATS->(COVID-19)-CAUSES->(Non-productive cough)\n(imbalance)-CAUSES->(Disease)-CAUSES->(Non-productive cough)\n(imbalance)-CAUSES->(Symptoms)-CAUSES->(Non-productive cough)\n(imbalance)-CAUSES->(Virus Diseases)-CAUSES->(Non-productive cough)\n(Calcium Channel Blockers)-CAUSES->(Vasodilation)\n(Vasodilation)-PROCESS_OF->(Pancreas)-CAUSES->(Pancreatitis)-CAUSES->(Disease)-CAUSES->(Non-productive cough)\n(Vasodilation)-PROCESS_OF->(Pancreas)-CAUSES->(Pancreatitis)-CAUSES->(Symptoms)-CAUSES->(Non-productive cough)\n(Vasodilation)-PROCESS_OF->(Pancreas)-CAUSES->(Pancreatitis)-CAUSES->(Pleural effusion disorder)-CAUSES->(Non-productive cough)\n(Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors)-PREVENTS->(Pathogenesis)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Bradykinin)\n(Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors)-PREVENTS->(Adhesions)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Bradykinin)\n(Diuretics)-CAUSES->(Excretory function)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Electrolytes)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"ACE inhibitors are known to cause a dry cough due to the accumulation of bradykinin, which is a well-documented side effect. This aligns with the evidence paths showing bradykinin causing non-productive coughs. Diuretics, while they can cause electrolyte imbalances, do not have a clear or direct link to causing a dry cough. Calcium channel blockers primarily cause vasodilation and are not associated with dry coughs. Beta blockers can cause bronchoconstriction, which might lead to a cough, but this is not typically a dry cough and is less common than the cough associated with ACE inhibitors. Therefore, the most likely drug responsible for the dry cough in this scenario is an ACE inhibitor.\"\n}\n```",
