      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Levamisole is used as all except -\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Single dose in ascariasis\nopb. Immunostimulant\nopc. Paralysis of worms by depolarisation\nopd. Immunodepressant in high doses\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Levamisole\" -> \"used as single dose in ascariasis\" -> \"effective treatment\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Levamisole\" -> \"acts as immunostimulant\" -> \"enhances immune response\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Levamisole\" -> \"causes paralysis of worms\" -> \"depolarisation of worm muscles\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Levamisole\" -> \"immunodepressant in high doses\" -> \"possible but not widely accepted\" -> 60%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Levamisole)-TREATS->(Ascariasis)\n(Immunologic Adjuvants)-CAUSES->(Immunity)\n(Levamisole)-TREATS->(Helminthiasis)\n(Levamisole)-TREATS->(Disease)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Immunity)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Immunologic Adjuvants)\n(Levamisole)-TREATS->(Disease)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Antiinflammatory Effect)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Immunologic Adjuvants)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Levamisole is used as a single dose treatment for ascariasis, as it is effective in causing paralysis of worms through depolarization of their muscles. It also acts as an immunostimulant, enhancing the immune response, which is supported by its association with immunologic adjuvants. However, the use of levamisole as an immunodepressant in high doses is not widely accepted or supported by standard medical consensus. Therefore, the correct answer is that levamisole is not used as an immunodepressant in high doses.\"\n}\n```",
