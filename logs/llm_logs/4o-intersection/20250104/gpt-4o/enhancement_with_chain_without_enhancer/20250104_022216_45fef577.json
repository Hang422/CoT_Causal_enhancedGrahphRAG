      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Which of the following dings is not used for anxiety?\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Propanolol\nopb. Aiprazolam\nopc. Buspirone\nopd. Haloperidol\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Propanolol\" -> \"beta-blocker\" -> \"used for anxiety\" -> 80%\nCHAIN: \"Alprazolam\" -> \"benzodiazepine\" -> \"used for anxiety\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Buspirone\" -> \"anxiolytic\" -> \"used for anxiety\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Haloperidol\" -> \"antipsychotic\" -> \"not typically used for anxiety\" -> 85%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Adrenergic beta-Antagonists)-CAUSES->(Anxiety)\n(Benzodiazepines)-TREATS->(Anxiety)\n(Anti-Anxiety Agents)-CAUSES->(Anxiety)\n(Antipsychotic Agents)-TREATS->(Anxiety)\n(Propranolol)-ISA->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Adrenergic beta-Antagonists)\n(Propranolol)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Adrenergic beta-Antagonists)\n(Alprazolam)-TREATS->(Disease)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Virus)-LOCATION_OF->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Benzodiazepines)\n(Alprazolam)-TREATS->(Chronic Disease)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Virus)-LOCATION_OF->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Benzodiazepines)\n(Buspirone)-ISA->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Anti-Anxiety Agents)\n(Buspirone)-ISA->(Tranquilizing Agents)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Anti-Anxiety Agents)\n(Haloperidol)-ISA->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Antipsychotic Agents)\n(Haloperidol)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Antipsychotic Agents)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Propranolol is a beta-blocker that can be used off-label for anxiety, particularly for physical symptoms like tremors and palpitations, but it is not primarily an anxiolytic. Alprazolam is a benzodiazepine and is widely used for treating anxiety disorders, supported by its classification and evidence paths. Buspirone is an anxiolytic specifically used for anxiety, aligning with both its classification and evidence paths. Haloperidol is an antipsychotic and is not typically used for anxiety, which is consistent with its classification and the evidence paths. Therefore, Haloperidol is the drug not used for anxiety in the context of this question.\"\n}\n```",
