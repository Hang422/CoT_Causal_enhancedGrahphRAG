Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Vitamin B12 intrinsic factor absorption occurs in\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Duodenum\nopb. Ileum\nopc. Jejunum\nopd.

Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Vitamin B12 absorption occurs in the ileum, where it binds to intrinsic factor, a protein secreted by the stomach. This complex travels through the duodenum and jejunum before reaching the ileum, where absorption takes place. The reasoning chains correctly identify the ileum as the site of absorption, consistent with medical consensus. The evidence paths, while broad, support the role of intrinsic factor in the uptake process within the ileum. Other parts of the small intestine, such as the duodenum and jejunum, are transit points and not sites of absorption for the Vitamin B12-intrinsic factor complex. Therefore, option 'opb. Ileum' is the correct answer.\"\n}\n```",
