      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Which of the following drug is contraindicated in a patient of myasthenia gravis: September 2008\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Succinylcholine\nopb. Tubocurare\nopc. Pyridostigmine\nopd. Halothane\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Succinylcholine\" -> \"depolarizing neuromuscular blocker\" -> \"exacerbates muscle weakness\" -> \"contraindicated in myasthenia gravis\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Tubocurare\" -> \"non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocker\" -> \"increased muscle weakness\" -> \"contraindicated in myasthenia gravis\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Pyridostigmine\" -> \"acetylcholinesterase inhibitor\" -> \"improves neuromuscular transmission\" -> \"used in myasthenia gravis\" -> \"not contraindicated\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Halothane\" -> \"general anesthetic\" -> \"no direct effect on neuromuscular junction\" -> \"not contraindicated in myasthenia gravis\" -> 80%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Depolarizing Neuromuscular Blocker)-CAUSES->(Fluctuation)-CAUSES->(Disease)-CAUSES->(Paresis)\n(Depolarizing Neuromuscular Blocker)-CAUSES->(Fluctuation)-CAUSES->(Infection)-CAUSES->(Paresis)\n(Depolarizing Neuromuscular Blocker)-CAUSES->(Fluctuation)-CAUSES->(Hypertensive disease)-CAUSES->(Paresis)\n(Paresis)-CAUSES->(Myasthenia Gravis)\n(Paresis)-CAUSES->(Myasthenia Gravis)\n(Succinylcholine)-ISA->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Acetylcholinesterase Inhibitors)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Depolarizing Neuromuscular Blocker)\n(Pyridostigmine)-TREATS->(Hypertension, Pulmonary)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(IMPACT gene)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Acetylcholinesterase Inhibitors)\n(Halothane)-INTERACTS_WITH->(CA2)-PART_OF->(Tissue membrane)-LOCATION_OF->(General Anesthesia)\n(Halothane)-INTERACTS_WITH->(CA2)-PART_OF->(Myocardium)-LOCATION_OF->(General Anesthesia)\n(General Anesthesia)-CAUSES->(Tachycardia, Ventricular)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Genes)-PART_OF->(Neuromuscular Junction)\n(General Anesthesia)-TREATS->(Tachycardia, Ventricular)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Genes)-PART_OF->(Neuromuscular Junction)\n(Neuromuscular Junction)-LOCATION_OF->(Virus)-CAUSES->(Myasthenia Gravis)\n(Neuromuscular Junction)-PART_OF->(Eye)-LOCATION_OF->(Myasthenia Gravis)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"In patients with myasthenia gravis, the use of succinylcholine is contraindicated. Succinylcholine is a depolarizing neuromuscular blocker that can exacerbate muscle weakness, which aligns with the consensus that it should be avoided in myasthenia gravis. The evidence path supports this by linking depolarizing neuromuscular blockers to muscle weakness (paresis), which is a concern in myasthenia gravis. Tubocurare, a non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocker, can also increase muscle weakness, but it is not as strongly contraindicated as succinylcholine. Pyridostigmine, an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, is used to improve neuromuscular transmission in myasthenia gravis and is not contraindicated. Halothane, a general anesthetic, does not directly affect the neuromuscular junction in a way that would contraindicate its use in myasthenia gravis. Therefore, succinylcholine is the most contraindicated option for a patient with myasthenia gravis.\"\n}\n```",
