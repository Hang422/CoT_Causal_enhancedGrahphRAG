      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Heparin is the commonly used anticoagulant in cardiac surgery. All of the following are true about heparin except-\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Weakest acid found in living things\nopb. Most commercial preparations of heparin now utilize pig intestinal slimes\nopc. Act via Antithrombin activation\nopd. Produce thrombocytopenia\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Heparin\" -> \"anticoagulant\" -> \"acts via Antithrombin activation\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Heparin\" -> \"commercial preparations\" -> \"utilize pig intestinal slimes\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Heparin\" -> \"side effect\" -> \"produce thrombocytopenia\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Heparin\" -> \"weakest acid\" -> \"found in living things\" -> \"possible misconception\" -> 60%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Heparin)-PREVENTS->(Adverse effects)\n(Adverse effects)-CAUSES->(Thrombocytopenia)\n(Heparin)-ISA->(Anticoagulants)\n(Heparin)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Anticoagulants)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Heparin is a commonly used anticoagulant in cardiac surgery. It acts via the activation of Antithrombin, which is a well-established mechanism of action for heparin, confirming option 'opc' as true. Most commercial preparations of heparin are derived from pig intestinal mucosa, supporting option 'opb' as true. Heparin can cause thrombocytopenia as a side effect, aligning with option 'opd' as true. However, the claim that heparin is the 'weakest acid found in living things' is incorrect and not supported by standard biochemical consensus, making option 'opa' the exception. The retrieved evidence paths confirm that heparin is an anticoagulant and can cause thrombocytopenia, but do not support the claim about it being the weakest acid.\"\n}\n```",
