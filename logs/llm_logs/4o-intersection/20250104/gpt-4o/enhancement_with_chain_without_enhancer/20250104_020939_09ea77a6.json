      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Physiology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        All are TRUE about protease activated receptors, EXCEPT:\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Family of three seven transmembrane protein\nopb. Activated by thrombin\nopc. Releases PGE2\nopd. Protects epithelial cells\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Protease activated receptors\" -> \"family of four seven transmembrane proteins\" -> \"not family of three\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Protease activated receptors\" -> \"activated by thrombin\" -> \"signal transduction\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Protease activated receptors\" -> \"possible release of PGE2\" -> \"unclear mechanism\" -> 70%\nCHAIN: \"Protease activated receptors\" -> \"protects epithelial cells\" -> \"cellular defense\" -> 85%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Receptors, Proteinase-Activated)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cells)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Integral Membrane Proteins)\n(Receptors, Proteinase-Activated)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cells)-LOCATION_OF->(Integral Membrane Proteins)\n(Receptors, Proteinase-Activated)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cells)-LOCATION_OF->(Thrombin)\n(Receptors, Proteinase-Activated)-INTERACTS_WITH->(mast cell)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Thrombin)\n(Receptors, Proteinase-Activated)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cells)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Dinoprostone)\n(Receptors, Proteinase-Activated)-CAUSES->(Prostaglandin Production)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Dinoprostone)\n(Receptors, Proteinase-Activated)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Epithelial Cells)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Protease activated receptors (PARs) are a family of four seven transmembrane proteins, not three, which contradicts option opa. They are indeed activated by thrombin, supporting option opb, as thrombin cleaves the receptor to initiate signal transduction. While PARs can be involved in prostaglandin production, the specific release of PGE2 (prostaglandin E2) is not a well-established function, making option opc less certain. PARs do interact with epithelial cells and can play a role in cellular defense, supporting option opd. The evidence paths confirm interactions with thrombin and epithelial cells, aligning with consensus on activation and protective roles, but do not specifically support PGE2 release, which remains unclear.\"\n}\n```",
