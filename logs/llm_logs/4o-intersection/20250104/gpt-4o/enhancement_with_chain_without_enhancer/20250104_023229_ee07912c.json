      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Quinine given to a patient of falciparum malaria caused sweating and palpitation, the likely cause is?\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Cinchonism\nopb. Hyperglycemia\nopc. Hypoglycemia\nopd. Hypokalemia\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Quinine\" -> \"increased insulin secretion\" -> \"decreased blood glucose\" -> \"sweating and palpitation\" -> \"Hypoglycemia\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Quinine\" -> \"cardiac effects\" -> \"increased heart rate\" -> \"palpitation\" -> \"Cinchonism\" -> 75%\nCHAIN: \"Quinine\" -> \"electrolyte imbalance\" -> \"decreased potassium levels\" -> \"palpitation\" -> \"Hypokalemia\" -> 70%\nCHAIN: \"Quinine\" -> \"possible metabolic effects\" -> \"increased blood glucose\" -> \"sweating and palpitation\" -> \"Hyperglycemia\" -> 60%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Quinine)-TREATS->(Disease)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(metabolic effects)\n(Quinine)-TREATS->(Disease)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Immunity)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Electrolytes)\n(Quinine)-TREATS->(Disease)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(uptake)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Electrolytes)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Quinine is known to cause hypoglycemia due to increased insulin secretion, which can lead to symptoms like sweating and palpitation. This aligns with the consensus that hypoglycemia is a likely cause of these symptoms in patients treated with quinine. While quinine can have cardiac effects, the specific symptoms of sweating and palpitation are more directly linked to hypoglycemia rather than cinchonism, which typically involves tinnitus, headache, and dizziness. The evidence paths related to metabolic effects and electrolyte imbalances are broad, but they do not directly support hyperglycemia or hypokalemia as primary causes in this context. Therefore, hypoglycemia is the most supported explanation for the symptoms observed in the patient.\"\n}\n```",
