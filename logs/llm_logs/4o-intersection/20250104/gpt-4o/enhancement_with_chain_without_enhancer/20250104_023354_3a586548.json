Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"The digestion of disaccharides primarily occurs in the small intestine. Disaccharides such as sucrose and lactose are broken down by specific enzymes like sucrase and lactase, which are located in the small intestine. This aligns with the consensus that the small intestine is the main site for disaccharide digestion, where these enzymes facilitate the conversion of disaccharides into monosaccharides for absorption. The evidence paths support this by indicating interactions between enzymes like sucrase and the small intestine, confirming the presence and activity of these enzymes in this location. Other parts of the digestive tract, such as the mouth and stomach, do not significantly contribute to disaccharide digestion, and the large intestine is not a primary site for this process, although some bacterial fermentation can occur there.\"\n}\n```",
