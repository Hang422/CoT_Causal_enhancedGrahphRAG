      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Physiology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Which of the following enzyme is associated with the conversion of androgen to oestrogen in a growing ovarian follicle is:\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Aromatase\nopb. 5 alpha reductase\nopc. Desmolase\nopd. Isomerase\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Aromatase\" -> \"conversion of androgen\" -> \"to estrogen\" -> \"in ovarian follicle\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"5 alpha reductase\" -> \"conversion of testosterone\" -> \"to dihydrotestosterone\" -> \"not involved in estrogen synthesis\" -> 20%\nCHAIN: \"Desmolase\" -> \"cholesterol conversion\" -> \"to pregnenolone\" -> \"steroidogenesis\" -> \"not specific to estrogen synthesis\" -> 30%\nCHAIN: \"Isomerase\" -> \"conversion of steroid intermediates\" -> \"in steroidogenesis\" -> \"not specific to estrogen synthesis\" -> 25%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Estrogens)-CAUSES->(uptake)-PROCESS_OF->(Ovarian Follicle)\n(Estrogens)-CAUSES->(Menopause)-PROCESS_OF->(Ovarian Follicle)\n(Estrogens)-CAUSES->(paracrine)-PROCESS_OF->(Ovarian Follicle)\n(Aromatase)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cells)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Androgens)\n(Aromatase)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cells)-LOCATION_OF->(Androgens)\n(Androgens)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Estrogens)\n(Testosterone)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Stanolone)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Aromatase is the enzyme responsible for the conversion of androgens to estrogens in the ovarian follicle, which is a key step in estrogen synthesis. This aligns with the consensus that aromatase facilitates the aromatization of androgens into estrogens, a critical process in the development of the ovarian follicle. The evidence paths support this by showing interactions between aromatase, cells, and androgens, confirming its role in estrogen production. In contrast, 5 alpha reductase converts testosterone to dihydrotestosterone and is not involved in estrogen synthesis. Desmolase is involved in the conversion of cholesterol to pregnenolone, a step in steroidogenesis but not specific to estrogen synthesis. Isomerase is involved in the conversion of steroid intermediates but does not specifically contribute to estrogen synthesis. Therefore, aromatase is the correct enzyme associated with the conversion of androgen to estrogen in a growing ovarian follicle.\"\n}\n```",
