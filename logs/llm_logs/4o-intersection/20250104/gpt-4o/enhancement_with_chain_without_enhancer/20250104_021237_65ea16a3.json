      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Biochemistry.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Nyctalopia is due to deficiency of\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Vitamin A\nopb. Vitamin B\nopc. Vitamin C\nopd. Vitamin E\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Nyctalopia\" -> \"impaired night vision\" -> \"retinal function affected\" -> \"Vitamin A deficiency\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Nyctalopia\" -> \"rod cell dysfunction\" -> \"retinal health compromised\" -> \"Vitamin A deficiency\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Nyctalopia\" -> \"visual pigment rhodopsin affected\" -> \"Vitamin A deficiency\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Nyctalopia\" -> \"possible nutritional deficiency\" -> \"Vitamin A deficiency\" -> 80%\nCHAIN: \"Nyctalopia\" -> \"Vitamin A deficiency\" -> \"impaired night vision\" -> 90%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Night Blindness)-CAUSES->(Anemia)-CAUSES->(Malnutrition)\n(Night Blindness)-COMPLICATES->(Cirrhosis)-CAUSES->(Malnutrition)\n(Night Blindness)-PREDISPOSES->(Zinc deficiency)-CAUSES->(Malnutrition)\n(Malnutrition)-CAUSES->(Vitamin A Deficiency)\n(Night Blindness)-CAUSES->(Blind Vision)-CAUSES->(Vitamin A Deficiency)\n(Night Blindness)-PREDISPOSES->(Deficiency, Vitamin)-CAUSES->(Vitamin A Deficiency)\n(Night Blindness)-CAUSES->(Anemia)-PREDISPOSES->(Vitamin A Deficiency)\n(Retina)-LOCATION_OF->(Vitamin A Deficiency)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Nyctalopia, or night blindness, is primarily due to a deficiency in Vitamin A. This is because Vitamin A is essential for the production of rhodopsin, a visual pigment in the rod cells of the retina, which is crucial for low-light vision. The reasoning chains correctly identify Vitamin A deficiency as the cause of nyctalopia, aligning with the consensus that Vitamin A is vital for retinal health and function. The retrieved evidence paths support this by linking night blindness to Vitamin A deficiency through malnutrition and retinal involvement. Other vitamins, such as B, C, and E, are not directly associated with nyctalopia, making Vitamin A the correct answer.\"\n}\n```",
