      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Biochemistry.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Hypermagnesemia may be observed in:\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Hyperparathyroidism\nopb. Diabetes mellitus\nopc. Kwashiorkor\nopd. Primary aldosteronism\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Hyperparathyroidism\" -> \"increased parathyroid hormone\" -> \"increased renal reabsorption of magnesium\" -> \"hypermagnesemia\" -> 70%\nCHAIN: \"Diabetes mellitus\" -> \"possible renal impairment\" -> \"decreased magnesium excretion\" -> \"hypermagnesemia\" -> 60%\nCHAIN: \"Kwashiorkor\" -> \"protein malnutrition\" -> \"possible electrolyte imbalance\" -> \"unclear magnesium levels\" -> 50%\nCHAIN: \"Primary aldosteronism\" -> \"increased aldosterone\" -> \"increased renal excretion of magnesium\" -> \"hypomagnesemia\" -> 30%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Diabetes Mellitus)-CAUSES->(Renal Insufficiency)\n(Renal Reabsorption)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(calcium ion)-TREATS->(Symptoms)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(hypermagnesemia)\n(Renal Reabsorption)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(calcium ion)-PREVENTS->(Symptoms)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(hypermagnesemia)\n(Kwashiorkor)-CAUSES->(Disease)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Hopping)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Electrolytes)\n(Kwashiorkor)-PREDISPOSES->(Disease)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Hopping)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Electrolytes)\n(Conn Syndrome)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Pathogenesis)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Aldosterone)\n(Conn Syndrome)-CAUSES->(Hypertrophy, Left Ventricular)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Aldosterone)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Hypermagnesemia is typically not associated with hyperparathyroidism, as increased parathyroid hormone primarily affects calcium and phosphate metabolism rather than significantly increasing magnesium reabsorption. In diabetes mellitus, renal impairment can lead to decreased magnesium excretion, potentially causing hypermagnesemia, supported by the evidence path linking diabetes to renal insufficiency. Kwashiorkor, characterized by protein malnutrition, can cause electrolyte imbalances, but its direct effect on magnesium levels is unclear and not typically associated with hypermagnesemia. Primary aldosteronism, or Conn syndrome, leads to increased aldosterone, which enhances renal excretion of magnesium, more commonly resulting in hypomagnesemia rather than hypermagnesemia. Therefore, among the options, diabetes mellitus is the most plausible condition where hypermagnesemia may be observed due to potential renal impairment.\"\n}\n```",
