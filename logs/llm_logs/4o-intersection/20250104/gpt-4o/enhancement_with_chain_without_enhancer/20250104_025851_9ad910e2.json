      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Physiology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        True regarding respiratory centre\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Directly simulated by fall in PaO2\nopb. Connected with cardiac center\nopc. Inhibited during swallowing\nopd. Situated in midbrain\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Respiratory centre\" -> \"located in brainstem\" -> \"connected with cardiac center\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Respiratory centre\" -> \"located in brainstem\" -> \"inhibited during swallowing\" -> 80%\nCHAIN: \"Respiratory centre\" -> \"located in brainstem\" -> \"not directly stimulated by fall in PaO2\" -> 70%\nCHAIN: \"Respiratory centre\" -> \"located in brainstem\" -> \"not situated in midbrain\" -> 90%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Brain Stem)-LOCATION_OF->(Lipopolysaccharides)-PART_OF->(Blood arterial)-LOCATION_OF->(PO2 measurement)\n(Brain Stem)-LOCATION_OF->(Lipopolysaccharides)-PART_OF->(Capillary blood)-LOCATION_OF->(PO2 measurement)\n(Brain Stem)-PART_OF->(Midbrain structure)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"The respiratory center is located in the brainstem, specifically in the medulla oblongata and pons, not the midbrain. It is not directly stimulated by a fall in PaO2; instead, it is primarily responsive to changes in PaCO2 and pH levels. The respiratory center is connected with the cardiac center through autonomic pathways, allowing for coordinated control of respiratory and cardiovascular functions. During swallowing, the respiratory center is temporarily inhibited to prevent aspiration, which aligns with the protective reflexes of the body. The evidence paths mentioning the brainstem and midbrain structure confirm the location of the respiratory center but do not directly address the stimulation by PaO2 or the inhibition during swallowing. Therefore, the most accurate statements are that the respiratory center is connected with the cardiac center and is inhibited during swallowing.\"\n}\n```",
