      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Drug which do not cause hyperprolactinemia:\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Bromocriptine\nopb. Haloperidol\nopc. Reserpine\nopd. Chlorpromazine\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Bromocriptine\" -> \"dopamine agonist\" -> \"inhibits prolactin release\" -> \"does not cause hyperprolactinemia\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Haloperidol\" -> \"dopamine antagonist\" -> \"increases prolactin release\" -> \"causes hyperprolactinemia\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Reserpine\" -> \"depletes monoamines\" -> \"possible increase in prolactin\" -> \"possible hyperprolactinemia\" -> 70%\nCHAIN: \"Chlorpromazine\" -> \"dopamine antagonist\" -> \"increases prolactin release\" -> \"causes hyperprolactinemia\" -> 90%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Prolactin)-PREVENTS->(Hyperprolactinemia)\n(Prolactin)-PREVENTS->(Hyperprolactinemia)\n(Prolactin)-PREVENTS->(Hyperprolactinemia)\n(Prolactin)-PREVENTS->(Hyperprolactinemia)\n(Bromocriptine)-ISA->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Dopamine)\n(Dopamine)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Prolactin)\n(Dopamine)-PART_OF->(Cells)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Prolactin)\n(Haloperidol)-ISA->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Dopamine Antagonists)\n(Haloperidol)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Dopamine Antagonists)\n(Dopamine Antagonists)-ISA->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Prolactin)\n(Dopamine Antagonists)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Prolactin)\n(Chlorpromazine)-ISA->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Dopamine Antagonists)\n(Chlorpromazine)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Dopamine Antagonists)\n(Dopamine Antagonists)-ISA->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Prolactin)\n(Dopamine Antagonists)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Prolactin)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Bromocriptine is a dopamine agonist, which inhibits prolactin release, thus it does not cause hyperprolactinemia. This aligns with the evidence path showing bromocriptine's interaction with dopamine, which in turn interacts with prolactin. Haloperidol and chlorpromazine are dopamine antagonists, which increase prolactin release and cause hyperprolactinemia, supported by evidence paths showing their interaction with dopamine antagonists and prolactin. Reserpine depletes monoamines, potentially increasing prolactin levels and possibly causing hyperprolactinemia, though this is less direct and certain compared to the dopamine antagonists. Therefore, bromocriptine is the drug that does not cause hyperprolactinemia.\"\n}\n```",
