      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Hyperprolactinemia is a side effect of\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Bromocriptine\nopb. Levodopa\nopc. Amantadine\nopd. Metoclopramide\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Metoclopramide\" -> \"dopamine receptor blockade\" -> \"increased prolactin secretion\" -> \"hyperprolactinemia\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Bromocriptine\" -> \"dopamine agonist\" -> \"decreased prolactin secretion\" -> \"unlikely hyperprolactinemia\" -> 10%\nCHAIN: \"Levodopa\" -> \"dopamine precursor\" -> \"increased dopamine levels\" -> \"decreased prolactin secretion\" -> \"unlikely hyperprolactinemia\" -> 15%\nCHAIN: \"Amantadine\" -> \"dopamine release stimulation\" -> \"increased dopamine levels\" -> \"decreased prolactin secretion\" -> \"unlikely hyperprolactinemia\" -> 20%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Metoclopramide)-TREATS->(Complication)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Dopamine Receptor)\n(Metoclopramide)-TREATS->(Functional disorder)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Dopamine Receptor)\n(Bromocriptine)-ISA->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Dopamine)\n(Amantadine)-ISA->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-PART_OF->(Cells)-PART_OF->(Extracellular Matrix)-LOCATION_OF->(Stimulation procedure)\n(Amantadine)-ISA->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-PART_OF->(Cells)-PART_OF->(Tissue specimen from aorta)-LOCATION_OF->(Stimulation procedure)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Hyperprolactinemia is a side effect of metoclopramide. Metoclopramide acts as a dopamine receptor antagonist, which leads to increased prolactin secretion and can result in hyperprolactinemia. This aligns with the consensus that dopamine receptor blockade increases prolactin levels. The evidence path supports this by associating metoclopramide with dopamine receptor interactions. In contrast, bromocriptine, levodopa, and amantadine are associated with increased dopamine activity, which typically decreases prolactin secretion, making hyperprolactinemia unlikely with these drugs. The evidence paths for these drugs do not contradict this consensus, as they focus on their roles in dopamine interaction and stimulation, which are consistent with decreased prolactin levels.\"\n}\n```",
