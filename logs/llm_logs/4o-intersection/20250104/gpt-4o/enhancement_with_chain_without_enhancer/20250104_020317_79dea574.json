      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Biochemistry.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        A 6-month-old male baby comes with vomiting, lethargy and severe jaundice when weaning was staed with fruit juice. Which of the following enzymes is defective?\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Fructokinase\nopb. Aldolase A\nopc. Aldolase B\nopd. Sucrase\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Weaning with fruit juice\" -> \"Fructose intake\" -> \"Fructose metabolism required\" -> \"Aldolase B needed\" -> \"Aldolase B deficiency\" -> \"Accumulation of toxic metabolites\" -> \"Vomiting, lethargy, severe jaundice\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Weaning with fruit juice\" -> \"Fructose intake\" -> \"Fructose metabolism required\" -> \"Fructokinase needed\" -> \"Fructokinase deficiency\" -> \"Possible mild symptoms\" -> \"Unlikely severe jaundice\" -> 40%\nCHAIN: \"Weaning with fruit juice\" -> \"Fructose intake\" -> \"Fructose metabolism required\" -> \"Aldolase A needed\" -> \"Aldolase A deficiency\" -> \"Unlikely related to fructose metabolism\" -> \"Unlikely severe jaundice\" -> 30%\nCHAIN: \"Weaning with fruit juice\" -> \"Fructose intake\" -> \"Fructose metabolism required\" -> \"Sucrase not involved\" -> \"Unrelated to symptoms\" -> 20%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Aldolase B)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Hepatocyte)-PART_OF->(Intestines)-LOCATION_OF->(Hereditary fructose intolerance syndrome)\n(Aldolase B)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cells)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Vaccines)-TREATS->(Hereditary fructose intolerance syndrome)\n(FRUCTOKINASE)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cells)-LOCATION_OF->(Fructose)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Deficiency of fructokinase)\n(FRUCTOKINASE)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cells)-INTERACTS_WITH->(mutant gene)-CAUSES->(Deficiency of fructokinase)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"The symptoms of vomiting, lethargy, and severe jaundice in a 6-month-old baby after weaning with fruit juice suggest a defect in fructose metabolism. The standard medical consensus indicates that Aldolase B is crucial for the metabolism of fructose-1-phosphate, a key step in fructose metabolism. A deficiency in Aldolase B leads to hereditary fructose intolerance, characterized by the accumulation of toxic metabolites, causing severe symptoms such as vomiting, lethargy, and jaundice. The retrieved evidence supports this by linking Aldolase B to hereditary fructose intolerance syndrome. Fructokinase deficiency typically results in benign fructosuria with mild symptoms, not severe jaundice. Aldolase A is not primarily involved in fructose metabolism, and sucrase is unrelated to fructose metabolism. Therefore, the defective enzyme is most likely Aldolase B.\"\n}\n```",
