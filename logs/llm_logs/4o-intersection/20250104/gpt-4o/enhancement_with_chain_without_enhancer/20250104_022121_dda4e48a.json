      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Biochemistry.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        True statement regarding insulin:\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Produced by alpha cells of pancreas\nopb. Two polypeptide chains are bound by disulfide linkages\nopc. Shifts potassium outside the cell\nopd. S.c insulin tl/2 is 60 mins\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Insulin\" -> \"produced by beta cells of pancreas\" -> \"not alpha cells\" -> 0%\nCHAIN: s\" -> \"bound by disulfide linkages\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Insulin\" -> \"shifts potassium into cells\" -> \"not outside\" -> 0%\nCHAIN: \"Subcutaneous insulin\" -> \"half-life\" -> \"approximately 5-10 minutes\" -> \"not 60 minutes\" -> 0%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Insulin)-CAUSES->(Energy Metabolism)-PROCESS_OF->(Pancreas)\n(Insulin)-CAUSES->(physiological aspects)-PROCESS_OF->(Pancreas)\n(Insulin)-CAUSES->(Excretory function)-PROCESS_OF->(Pancreas)\n(Insulin)-CAUSES->(GLUCOSE TOLERANCE)-PROCESS_OF->(Cells)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Insulin is produced by the beta cells of the pancreas, not the alpha cells, which produce glucagon. Insulin consists of two polypeptide chains (A and B) that are connected by disulfide linkages, which is a well-established biochemical fact. Insulin facilitates the uptake of potassium into cells, not the shift of potassium outside the cells. The half-life of subcutaneous insulin is approximately 5-10 minutes, not 60 minutes. The retrieved evidence paths broadly confirm insulin's role in energy metabolism and glucose tolerance, which are consistent with its physiological functions but do not directly address the specific options provided.\"\n}\n```",
