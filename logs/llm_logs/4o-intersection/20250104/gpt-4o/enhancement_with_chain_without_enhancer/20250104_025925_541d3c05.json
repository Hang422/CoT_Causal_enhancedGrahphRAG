      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        The drug which does not cause myopathy is :\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Chloroquine\nopb. Betamethasone\nopc. Chloramphenicol\nopd. Zidovudine\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Chloroquine\" -> \"antimalarial drug\" -> \"known to cause myopathy\" -> 70%\nCHAIN: \"Betamethasone\" -> \"corticosteroid\" -> \"muscle weakness possible\" -> \"myopathy possible\" -> 60%\nCHAIN: \"Chloramphenicol\" -> \"antibiotic\" -> \"no known association with myopathy\" -> 80%\nCHAIN: \"Zidovudine\" -> \"antiretroviral drug\" -> \"known to cause myopathy\" -> 70%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Antimalarials)-CAUSES->(Myopathy)\n(Adrenal Cortex Hormones)-CAUSES->(Paresis)\n(Paresis)-CAUSES->(Disease)-CAUSES->(Myopathy)\n(Chloroquine)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Antimalarials)\n(Betamethasone)-ISA->(Adrenal Cortex Hormones)\n(Betamethasone)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Adrenal Cortex Hormones)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Chloroquine is an antimalarial drug known to cause myopathy, supported by evidence linking antimalarials to myopathy. Betamethasone, a corticosteroid, can cause muscle weakness and potentially myopathy, as supported by evidence linking adrenal cortex hormones to paresis and myopathy. Chloramphenicol, an antibiotic, has no known association with myopathy, making it the most likely option not to cause myopathy. Zidovudine, an antiretroviral drug, is known to cause myopathy. Therefore, based on consensus and evidence, Chloramphenicol is the drug that does not cause myopathy.\"\n}\n```",
