      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Biochemistry.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Phenylketonuria caused by deficiency of\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Tyrosine transaminase\nopb. Tyrosine hydroxylase\nopc. Phenylalanine hydroxylase\nopd. Phenylketonuria hydroxylase\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Phenylalanine\" -> \"phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency\" -> \"accumulation of phenylalanine\" -> \"phenylketonuria\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Phenylalanine\" -> \"tyrosine hydroxylase\" -> \"dopamine synthesis\" -> \"not directly related to phenylketonuria\" -> 20%\nCHAIN: \"Phenylalanine\" -> \"tyrosine transaminase\" -> \"tyrosine metabolism\" -> \"not directly related to phenylketonuria\" -> 20%\nCHAIN: \"Phenylalanine\" -> \"phenylketonuria hydroxylase\" -> \"unclear enzyme\" -> \"not recognized in medical literature\" -> 10%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Phenylalanine)-TREATS->(Phenylketonurias)\n(Phenylalanine)-TREATS->(Phenylketonurias)\n(Phenylketonurias)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Pathogenesis)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Phenylalanine)\n(Phenylketonurias)-ISA->(Acidemia)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Phenylalanine)\n(Phenylalanine)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cells)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Tyrosine 3-Monooxygenase)\n(Phenylalanine)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Leukocytes)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Tyrosine 3-Monooxygenase)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Phenylketonuria (PKU) is caused by a deficiency of the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase, which is responsible for converting phenylalanine to tyrosine. This deficiency leads to the accumulation of phenylalanine in the body, resulting in the condition known as phenylketonuria. The reasoning chain for option 'opc. Phenylalanine hydroxylase' correctly identifies this enzyme as the cause of PKU, aligning with standard medical consensus. The retrieved evidence paths, while broad, support the association between phenylalanine and phenylketonuria, confirming the role of phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency in the pathogenesis of PKU. Other options, such as tyrosine hydroxylase and tyrosine transaminase, are involved in different metabolic pathways and are not directly related to the cause of PKU. The term 'phenylketonuria hydroxylase' is not recognized in medical literature and is likely a misnomer or error.\"\n}\n```",
