      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Chloroquine is useful in\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Discoid lupus erythematous\nopb. Rheumatoid ahritis\nopc. Infectious mononucleosis\nopd. All of the above\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Chloroquine\" -> \"anti-inflammatory effects\" -> \"improvement in discoid lupus erythematosus\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Chloroquine\" -> \"immunomodulatory effects\" -> \"potential benefit in rheumatoid arthritis\" -> 70%\nCHAIN: \"Chloroquine\" -> \"antiviral properties\" -> \"unclear effect on infectious mononucleosis\" -> 40%\nCHAIN: \"Chloroquine\" -> \"useful in discoid lupus erythematosus\" -> \"possible benefit in rheumatoid arthritis\" -> \"unclear effect on infectious mononucleosis\" -> 50%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Chloroquine)-TREATS->(Lupus Erythematosus, Discoid)\n(Lupus Erythematosus, Discoid)-CAUSES->(Adverse effects)-CAUSES->(Rheumatoid Arthritis)\n(Lupus Erythematosus, Discoid)-PREDISPOSES->(Lupus Erythematosus, Systemic)-COMPLICATES->(Rheumatoid Arthritis)\n(Lupus Erythematosus, Discoid)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Pathogenesis)-CAUSES->(Rheumatoid Arthritis)\n(Rheumatoid Arthritis)-CAUSES->(Infection)-CAUSES->(Infectious Mononucleosis)\n(Rheumatoid Arthritis)-CAUSES->(Epstein-Barr Virus Infections)-CAUSES->(Infectious Mononucleosis)\n(Rheumatoid Arthritis)-CAUSES->(Urticaria)-COMPLICATES->(Infectious Mononucleosis)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Chloroquine is well-established for its use in treating discoid lupus erythematosus due to its anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects. This aligns with the evidence path showing chloroquine's direct treatment of discoid lupus erythematosus. While chloroquine has some immunomodulatory effects that could theoretically benefit rheumatoid arthritis, it is not a standard treatment for this condition, and the evidence path does not directly support its use in rheumatoid arthritis. Chloroquine's antiviral properties are not effective against infectious mononucleosis, which is primarily caused by the Epstein-Barr virus, and there is no consensus or evidence supporting its use for this condition. Therefore, chloroquine is primarily useful in discoid lupus erythematosus, and not in rheumatoid arthritis or infectious mononucleosis.\"\n}\n```",
