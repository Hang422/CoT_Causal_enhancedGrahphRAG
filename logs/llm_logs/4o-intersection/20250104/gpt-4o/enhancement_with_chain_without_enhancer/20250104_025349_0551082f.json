      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Biochemistry.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        In all of the following enzyme deficiencies, hyperammonemia is a common feature, EXCEPT:\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Argininosuccinate synthetase\nopb. Carbamoyl Phosphate synthetase (CPS-I)\nopc. Ornithine transcarbamoylase (OTC)\nopd. Ornithine amino transferase\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Argininosuccinate synthetase deficiency\" -> \"urea cycle disruption\" -> \"accumulation of ammonia\" -> \"hyperammonemia\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Carbamoyl Phosphate synthetase (CPS-I) deficiency\" -> \"urea cycle disruption\" -> \"accumulation of ammonia\" -> \"hyperammonemia\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Ornithine transcarbamoylase (OTC) deficiency\" -> \"urea cycle disruption\" -> \"accumulation of ammonia\" -> \"hyperammonemia\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Ornithine amino transferase deficiency\" -> \"not directly involved in urea cycle\" -> \"no significant ammonia accumulation\" -> \"no hyperammonemia\" -> 90%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(ammonia)-TREATS->(Hyperammonemia)\n(ammonia)-TREATS->(Hyperammonemia)\n(ammonia)-TREATS->(Hyperammonemia)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"In the context of enzyme deficiencies and hyperammonemia, the urea cycle is crucial for detoxifying ammonia. Deficiencies in enzymes directly involved in the urea cycle, such as argininosuccinate synthetase, carbamoyl phosphate synthetase (CPS-I), and ornithine transcarbamoylase (OTC), lead to urea cycle disruption and subsequent hyperammonemia due to ammonia accumulation. This aligns with the consensus that these deficiencies result in hyperammonemia. However, ornithine amino transferase is not directly involved in the urea cycle, and its deficiency does not typically result in significant ammonia accumulation or hyperammonemia. Therefore, the correct answer is ornithine amino transferase deficiency, as it is the exception where hyperammonemia is not a common feature.\"\n}\n```",
