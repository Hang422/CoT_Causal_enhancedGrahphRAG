      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Biochemistry.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Menke's Kinky hair syndrome is due to defect in\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Ca transporter\nopb. Cu transporter\nopc. Zn transporter\nopd. Se transporter\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Menke's Kinky hair syndrome\" -> \"defect in copper metabolism\" -> \"Cu transporter\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Menke's Kinky hair syndrome\" -> \"abnormal hair texture\" -> \"defect in metal ion transport\" -> \"Cu transporter\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Menke's Kinky hair syndrome\" -> \"neurological symptoms\" -> \"copper deficiency\" -> \"Cu transporter\" -> 92%\nCHAIN: \"Menke's Kinky hair syndrome\" -> \"connective tissue disorder\" -> \"copper transport issue\" -> \"Cu transporter\" -> 93%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Menkes Kinky Hair Syndrome)-CAUSES->(Symptoms)-CAUSES->(Neurologic Symptoms)\n(Menkes Kinky Hair Syndrome)-CAUSES->(Hypocupremia)-CAUSES->(Neurologic Symptoms)\n(Menkes Kinky Hair Syndrome)-CAUSES->(Degenerative abnormality)-PREDISPOSES->(Neurologic Symptoms)\n(Neurologic Symptoms)-CAUSES->(Disease)-CAUSES->(Hypocupremia)\n(Neurologic Symptoms)-CAUSES->(Seizures)-CAUSES->(Hypocupremia)\n(Neurologic Symptoms)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Hepatolenticular Degeneration)-CAUSES->(Hypocupremia)\n(Menkes Kinky Hair Syndrome)-CAUSES->(Symptoms)-CAUSES->(Connective Tissue Diseases)\n(Menkes Kinky Hair Syndrome)-CAUSES->(Hypocupremia)-CAUSES->(Connective Tissue Diseases)\n(Menkes Kinky Hair Syndrome)-CAUSES->(Physical findings)-CAUSES->(Connective Tissue Diseases)\n(Hypocupremia)-CAUSES->(Functional disorder)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Membrane Transport Proteins)\n(Hypocupremia)-CAUSES->(Atrophic)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Membrane Transport Proteins)\n(Connective Tissue Diseases)-CAUSES->(Inflammation)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(neuropeptide Y|NPY)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cells)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Copper Transport Proteins)\n(Connective Tissue Diseases)-COMPLICATES->(Fetal Growth Retardation)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(neuropeptide Y|NPY)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cells)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Copper Transport Proteins)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Menke's Kinky hair syndrome is primarily caused by a defect in copper metabolism, specifically due to a malfunction in the copper transporter. This condition leads to copper deficiency (hypocupremia), which is responsible for the characteristic symptoms such as abnormal hair texture, neurological symptoms, and connective tissue disorders. The retrieved evidence paths support this by linking Menke's Kinky hair syndrome to hypocupremia, which in turn causes neurological and connective tissue symptoms. The consensus in medical biochemistry confirms that the defect in the Cu transporter is the underlying cause of Menke's Kinky hair syndrome, making option 'opb. Cu transporter' the correct answer.\"\n}\n```",
