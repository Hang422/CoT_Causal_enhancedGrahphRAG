      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Steroids are indicated in all of the following forms of tuberculosis except:\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Meningitis\nopb. Pericarditis\nopc. Ileo-caecal tuberculosis\nopd. Adrenal involvement\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Tuberculous meningitis\" -> \"inflammation of meninges\" -> \"steroids reduce inflammation\" -> \"steroids indicated\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Tuberculous pericarditis\" -> \"inflammation of pericardium\" -> \"steroids reduce inflammation\" -> \"steroids indicated\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Ileo-caecal tuberculosis\" -> \"localized intestinal infection\" -> \"steroids not typically used\" -> \"steroids not indicated\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Adrenal tuberculosis\" -> \"adrenal gland involvement\" -> \"steroids mimic adrenal hormones\" -> \"steroids not primarily for inflammation\" -> \"steroids not indicated\" -> 80%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Tuberculosis, Meningeal)-CAUSES->(Inflammation)\n(Pericarditis, Tuberculous)-CAUSES->(Congestive heart failure)-CAUSES->(Inflammation)\n(Pericarditis, Tuberculous)-CAUSES->(Heart failure)-CAUSES->(Inflammation)\n(Pericarditis, Tuberculous)-CAUSES->(Pneumonia)-CAUSES->(Inflammation)\n(Pericardial sac structure)-CAUSES->(Retroperitoneal fibrosis)-CAUSES->(Disease)-CAUSES->(Inflammation)\n(Adrenal hormone preparation)-TREATS->(Disease)-CAUSES->(Inflammation)\n(Adrenal hormone preparation)-TREATS->(Infection)-CAUSES->(Inflammation)\n(Adrenal hormone preparation)-TREATS->(Adverse effects)-COMPLICATES->(Inflammation)\n(Steroids)-TREATS->(Inflammation)\n(Inflammation)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(IL13 gene|IL13)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Steroids)\n(Inflammation)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(ELAVL2 gene|ELAVL2)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Steroids)\n(Meninges)-LOCATION_OF->(Inflammation)\n(Inflammation)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(IL13 gene|IL13)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Steroids)\n(Inflammation)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(ELAVL2 gene|ELAVL2)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Steroids)\n(Inflammation)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(IL13 gene|IL13)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Steroids)\n(Inflammation)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(ELAVL2 gene|ELAVL2)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Steroids)\n(Inflammation)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(IL13 gene|IL13)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Steroids)\n(Inflammation)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(ELAVL2 gene|ELAVL2)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Steroids)\n(Intestinal tract infectious disease NOS)-PREDISPOSES->(Pathogenesis)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(ELAVL2 gene|ELAVL2)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Steroids)\n(Intestinal tract infectious disease NOS)-CAUSES->(Pathogenesis)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(ELAVL2 gene|ELAVL2)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Steroids)\n(Adrenal Glands)-LOCATION_OF->(Prednisone)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Adrenal hormone preparation)\n(Adrenal Glands)-LOCATION_OF->(Adrenal Cortex Hormones)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Adrenal hormone preparation)\n(Inflammation)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(IL13 gene|IL13)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Steroids)\n(Inflammation)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(ELAVL2 gene|ELAVL2)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Steroids)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Steroids are indicated in tuberculous meningitis and pericarditis due to their ability to reduce inflammation, which is a key component of these conditions. The evidence paths support this by linking inflammation with steroid treatment. In ileo-caecal tuberculosis, steroids are not typically used as it is a localized intestinal infection where anti-tubercular therapy is the primary treatment. The evidence paths do not provide relevant support for steroid use in this context. In adrenal tuberculosis, while steroids can mimic adrenal hormones, they are not primarily used for inflammation in this condition, as the main issue is adrenal insufficiency rather than inflammation. Therefore, steroids are not indicated for adrenal involvement in tuberculosis. The consensus aligns with the reasoning that steroids are not indicated in ileo-caecal tuberculosis, making it the exception.\"\n}\n```",
