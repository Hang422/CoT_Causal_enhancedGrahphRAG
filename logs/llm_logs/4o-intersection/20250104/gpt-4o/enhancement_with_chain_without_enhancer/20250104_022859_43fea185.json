      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        All of the following are true about Nizatidine except\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. It is a H2 blocker used in peptic ulcer disease\nopb. It has 100% Bioavailability\nopc. It also enhances gastric emptying\nopd. It can also lead to tachycardia\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Nizatidine\" -> \"H2 blocker\" -> \"used in peptic ulcer disease\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Nizatidine\" -> \"bioavailability\" -> \"less than -> 100%\nCHAIN: \"Nizatidine\" -> \"enhances gastric emptying\" -> \"possible\" -> 60%\nCHAIN: \"Nizatidine\" -> \"side effects\" -> \"tachycardia\" -> 70%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Histamine H2 Antagonists)-PREVENTS->(Peptic Ulcer)\n(Nizatidine)-TREATS->(Disease)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Virus)-LOCATION_OF->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Histamine H2 Antagonists)\n(Nizatidine)-TREATS->(Parkinson Disease)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Virus)-LOCATION_OF->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Histamine H2 Antagonists)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Nizatidine is a histamine H2 receptor antagonist (H2 blocker) commonly used in the treatment of peptic ulcer disease, which aligns with standard medical consensus and is supported by evidence paths showing its role in preventing peptic ulcers. It does not have 100% bioavailability; its bioavailability is typically around 70%, contradicting the claim of 100% bioavailability. There is no strong consensus or evidence supporting the claim that Nizatidine enhances gastric emptying, making this statement questionable. While tachycardia is not a common side effect of Nizatidine, it is possible as a rare side effect, but this is not well-documented in standard references. Therefore, the statement about 100% bioavailability is the exception among the options provided.\"\n}\n```",
