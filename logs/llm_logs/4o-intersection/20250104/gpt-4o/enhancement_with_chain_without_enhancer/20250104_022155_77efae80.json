      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Biochemistry.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        A 10 year old child with aggressive, self mutilating behavior and poor concentration is brought with presenting complaints of joint pain and reduced urinary output. Child's presentation is most likely due to the deficiency of which enzyme?\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. HGPase\nopb. Adenosine Deaminase\nopc. APase\nopd. Acid Maltase\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Aggressive behavior\" -> \"Self-mutilation\" -> \"Neurological symptoms\" -> \"Gout-like symptoms\" -> \"Joint pain\" -> \"Reduced urinary output\" -> \"Lesch-Nyhan syndrome\" -> \"HGPRT deficiency\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Aggressive behavior\" -> \"Self-mutilation\" -> \"Neurological symptoms\" -> \"Purine metabolism disorder\" -> \"Joint pain\" -> \"Reduced urinary output\" -> \"Lesch-Nyhan syndrome\" -> \"HGPRT deficiency\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Aggressive behavior\" -> \"Self-mutilation\" -> \"Poor concentration\" -> \"Joint pain\" -> \"Reduced urinary output\" -> \"Hyperuricemia\" -> \"Lesch-Nyhan syndrome\" -> \"HGPRT deficiency\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Aggressive behavior\" -> \"Self-mutilation\" -> \"Neurological symptoms\" -> \"Joint pain\" -> \"Reduced urinary output\" -> \"Possible metabolic disorder\" -> \"HGPRT deficiency\" -> 80%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Disorder of purine metabolism)-CAUSES->(Disease)-CAUSES->(Arthralgia)\n(Hyperuricemia)-CAUSES->(Kidney Diseases)-CAUSES->(Lesch-Nyhan Syndrome)\n(Hyperuricemia)-CAUSES->(imbalance)-CAUSES->(Lesch-Nyhan Syndrome)\n(Hyperuricemia)-CAUSES->(Obesity)-PREDISPOSES->(Lesch-Nyhan Syndrome)\n(Neurologic Symptoms)-CAUSES->(Disease)-CAUSES->(Arthralgia)\n(Neurologic Symptoms)-CAUSES->(Symptoms)-CAUSES->(Arthralgia)\n(Neurologic Symptoms)-CAUSES->(Fatigue)-CAUSES->(Arthralgia)\n(Metabolic Diseases)-CAUSES->(Kidney Diseases)-CAUSES->(Lesch-Nyhan Syndrome)\n(Metabolic Diseases)-CAUSES->(Enzyme Deficiency)-CAUSES->(Lesch-Nyhan Syndrome)\n(Metabolic Diseases)-CAUSES->(imbalance)-CAUSES->(Lesch-Nyhan Syndrome)\n(Neurologic Symptoms)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Pathogenesis)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Genes)-PART_OF->(Liver)-LOCATION_OF->(Disorder of purine metabolism)\n(Neurologic Symptoms)-PREDISPOSES->(Atherosclerosis)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Genes)-PART_OF->(Liver)-LOCATION_OF->(Disorder of purine metabolism)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"The child's symptoms, including aggressive and self-mutilating behavior, poor concentration, joint pain, and reduced urinary output, are characteristic of Lesch-Nyhan syndrome. This condition is caused by a deficiency in the enzyme hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRT). The reasoning chains correctly identify HGPRT deficiency as the cause, aligning with the consensus that Lesch-Nyhan syndrome results from a disorder of purine metabolism leading to hyperuricemia and neurological symptoms. The retrieved evidence paths support this by linking purine metabolism disorders and hyperuricemia to Lesch-Nyhan syndrome and its symptoms. Other options, such as deficiencies in adenosine deaminase, acid phosphatase, or acid maltase, do not match the symptom profile or the specific metabolic pathway involved in this case.\"\n}\n```",
