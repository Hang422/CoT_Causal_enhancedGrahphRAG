      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Physiology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        The only Sugar normaly absorbed in the intestine against a concentration gradient is :\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Xylose\nopb. Mannose\nopc. Glucose\nopd. Ribose\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Glucose\" -> \"active transport\" -> \"against concentration gradient\" -> \"SGLT1 transporter\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Xylose\" -> \"passive diffusion\" -> \"along concentration gradient\" -> \"no active transport\" -> 60%\nCHAIN: \"Mannose\" -> \"passive diffusion\" -> \"along concentration gradient\" -> \"no active transport\" -> 60%\nCHAIN: \"Ribose\" -> \"passive diffusion\" -> \"along concentration gradient\" -> \"no active transport\" -> 60%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Glucose)-CAUSES->(Biological Transport, Active)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"The only sugar normally absorbed in the intestine against a concentration gradient is glucose. This process occurs via active transport, specifically through the SGLT1 transporter, which is a well-established mechanism in physiological consensus. The retrieved evidence path supports this by linking glucose to active biological transport. In contrast, xylose, mannose, and ribose are absorbed via passive diffusion, which occurs along their concentration gradients and does not involve active transport mechanisms. Therefore, glucose is the correct answer based on its unique absorption mechanism in the intestine.\"\n}\n```",
