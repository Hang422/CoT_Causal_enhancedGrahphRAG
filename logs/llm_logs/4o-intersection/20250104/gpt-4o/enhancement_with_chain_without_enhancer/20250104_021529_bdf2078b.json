      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Warfarin induced skin necrosis is seen in ?\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Protein C deficiency\nopb. Protein S deficiency\nopc. Hemophillia\nopd. Antithrombin III deficiency\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Warfarin administration\" -> \"reduced Protein C activity\" -> \"hypercoagulable state\" -> \"skin necrosis\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Warfarin administration\" -> \"reduced Protein S activity\" -> \"possible hypercoagulable state\" -> \"possible skin necrosis\" -> 60%\nCHAIN: \"Warfarin administration\" -> \"no effect on hemophilia\" -> \"no skin necrosis\" -> 10%\nCHAIN: \"Warfarin administration\" -> \"no significant effect on Antithrombin III\" -> \"no skin necrosis\" -> 10%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Protein C)-CAUSES->(imbalance)-CAUSES->(Thrombophilia)\n(Protein C)-TREATS->(Obesity)-CAUSES->(Thrombophilia)\n(Protein C)-TREATS->(Myocardial Infarction)-CAUSES->(Thrombophilia)\n(Thrombophilia)-CAUSES->(Skin necrosis)\n(Thrombophilia)-CAUSES->(Skin necrosis)\n(Hemophilia A)-CAUSES->(Disease)-CAUSES->(Skin necrosis)\n(Hemophilia A)-CAUSES->(Septicemia)-CAUSES->(Skin necrosis)\n(Hemophilia A)-CAUSES->(Rare Diseases)-CAUSES->(Skin necrosis)\n(Antithrombin III)-TREATS->(Infection)-CAUSES->(Skin necrosis)\n(Antithrombin III)-TREATS->(Thrombophlebitis)-CAUSES->(Skin necrosis)\n(Antithrombin III)-TREATS->(Calciphylaxis)-CAUSES->(Skin necrosis)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Warfarin-induced skin necrosis is most commonly associated with Protein C deficiency. This is because warfarin administration leads to a rapid reduction in Protein C activity, which is a natural anticoagulant, resulting in a temporary hypercoagulable state that can cause skin necrosis. The reasoning chain for Protein C deficiency aligns with the consensus and is supported by evidence paths indicating that an imbalance in Protein C can lead to thrombophilia, which in turn can cause skin necrosis. Protein S deficiency could theoretically lead to a similar outcome, but it is less commonly associated with warfarin-induced skin necrosis. Hemophilia and Antithrombin III deficiency do not typically result in skin necrosis when warfarin is administered, as they do not create the same hypercoagulable state. The evidence paths related to hemophilia and Antithrombin III are not directly relevant to warfarin-induced skin necrosis in this context.\"\n}\n```",
