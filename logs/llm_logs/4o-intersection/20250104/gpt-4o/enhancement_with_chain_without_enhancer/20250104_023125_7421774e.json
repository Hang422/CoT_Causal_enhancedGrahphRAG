      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Following a myocardial infarct, a 40-year-old man is being treated prophylactically with propranolol. You would be concerned about the use of this drug if the patient also had what comorbid condition\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Glaucoma\nopb. Essential tremor\nopc. Diabetes\nopd. Supraventricular tachycardia\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Propranolol\" -> \"beta-blocker\" -> \"decreased heart rate\" -> \"decreased hypoglycemia awareness\" -> \"Diabetes\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Propranolol\" -> \"beta-blocker\" -> \"bronchoconstriction\" -> \"possible asthma exacerbation\" -> \"unclear\" -> 60%\nCHAIN: \"Propranolol\" -> \"beta-blocker\" -> \"decreased heart rate\" -> \"decreased cardiac output\" -> \"Supraventricular tachycardia\" -> 70%\nCHAIN: \"Propranolol\" -> \"beta-blocker\" -> \"decreased intraocular pressure\" -> \"Glaucoma\" -> 50%\nCHAIN: \"Propranolol\" -> \"beta-blocker\" -> \"decreased tremor amplitude\" -> \"Essential tremor\" -> 40%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(hypoglycemia)-CAUSES->(Diabetes)\n(Propranolol)-ISA->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Adrenergic beta-Antagonists)\n(Propranolol)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Adrenergic beta-Antagonists)\n(Propranolol)-ISA->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Adrenergic beta-Antagonists)\n(Propranolol)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Adrenergic beta-Antagonists)\n(Propranolol)-ISA->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Adrenergic beta-Antagonists)\n(Propranolol)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Adrenergic beta-Antagonists)\n(Propranolol)-ISA->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Adrenergic beta-Antagonists)\n(Propranolol)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Adrenergic beta-Antagonists)\n(Propranolol)-ISA->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Adrenergic beta-Antagonists)\n(Propranolol)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Adrenergic beta-Antagonists)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Propranolol is a non-selective beta-blocker that can mask symptoms of hypoglycemia, such as tachycardia, which is particularly concerning in patients with diabetes. This aligns with the consensus that beta-blockers can decrease hypoglycemia awareness, making diabetes a significant comorbid condition to consider when prescribing propranolol. The evidence path supports this by linking hypoglycemia to diabetes. While propranolol can also cause bronchoconstriction, which may exacerbate asthma, this is not directly relevant to the options provided. Propranolol's effect on heart rate and cardiac output is generally beneficial in managing supraventricular tachycardia, not a concern. Its use in glaucoma and essential tremor is typically therapeutic rather than problematic. Therefore, diabetes is the comorbid condition of concern when using propranolol prophylactically after a myocardial infarction.\"\n}\n```",
