      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Aspirin is contraindicated in?\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Fever\nopb. Peptic ulcer\nopc. Unstable angina\nopd. Myalgia\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Aspirin\" -> \"inhibits prostaglandins\" -> \"reduces gastric mucosal protection\" -> \"increased risk of gastric bleeding\" -> \"peptic ulcer exacerbation\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Aspirin\" -> \"antiplatelet effect\" -> \"increased bleeding risk\" -> \"peptic ulcer bleeding\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Aspirin\" -> \"antipyretic effect\" -> \"reduces fever\" -> \"fever management\" -> 60%\nCHAIN: \"Aspirin\" -> \"anti-inflammatory effect\" -> \"reduces myalgia\" -> \"myalgia management\" -> 70%\nCHAIN: \"Aspirin\" -> \"antiplatelet effect\" -> \"prevents clot formation\" -> \"beneficial in unstable angina\" -> 80%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Gastric hemorrhage)-CAUSES->(Gastric ulcer)-CAUSES->(Peptic Ulcer)\n(Gastric hemorrhage)-CAUSES->(Hypovolemic Shock)-CAUSES->(Peptic Ulcer)\n(Gastric hemorrhage)-CAUSES->(Melena)-CAUSES->(Peptic Ulcer)\n(Aspirin)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Prostaglandins)\n(Aspirin)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Pathogenesis)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Prostaglandins)\n(Aspirin)-ISA->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Antiplatelet)\n(Aspirin)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Antiplatelet)\n(Antipyretic Effect)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Interleukin-1 beta)-CAUSES->(Fever)\n(Antipyretic Effect)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Interleukin-1 beta)-TREATS->(Fever)\n(Aspirin)-ISA->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Antiplatelet)\n(Aspirin)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Antiplatelet)\n(Antiplatelet)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Phosphotransferases)-INTERACTS_WITH->(T-Lymphocyte)-PART_OF->(Endothelium)-LOCATION_OF->(Clot formation)\n(Antiplatelet)-INTERACTS_WITH->(P2RY12 gene|P2RY12)-INTERACTS_WITH->(T-Lymphocyte)-PART_OF->(Transplanted tissue)-LOCATION_OF->(Clot formation)\n(Clot formation)-DIAGNOSES->(Diabetes)-COMPLICATES->(Unstable angina)\n(Clot formation)-DIAGNOSES->(Diabetes)-PREDISPOSES->(Unstable angina)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Aspirin is contraindicated in peptic ulcer disease due to its inhibition of prostaglandins, which reduces gastric mucosal protection and increases the risk of gastric bleeding. This is supported by evidence showing that gastric hemorrhage can lead to peptic ulcer exacerbation. Aspirin's antiplatelet effect further increases bleeding risk, making it unsuitable for patients with peptic ulcers. While aspirin has antipyretic and anti-inflammatory effects beneficial for managing fever and myalgia, these conditions do not contraindicate its use. Additionally, aspirin's antiplatelet properties are beneficial in preventing clot formation, making it useful rather than contraindicated in unstable angina. Therefore, the primary contraindication for aspirin among the options is peptic ulcer.\"\n}\n```",
