      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Drug of choice for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder is:-\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Haloperidol\nopb. Imipramine\nopc. Alprazolam\nopd. Methylphenidate\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Methylphenidate\" -> \"increased dopamine and norepinephrine in brain\" -> \"improved attention and focus\" -> \"reduced hyperactivity\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Haloperidol\" -> \"antipsychotic effects\" -> \"dopamine receptor blockade\" -> \"not typically used for ADHD\" -> 20%\nCHAIN: \"Imipramine\" -> \"tricyclic antidepressant\" -> \"increased norepinephrine and serotonin\" -> \"possible use in ADHD but not first-line\" -> 40%\nCHAIN: \"Alprazolam\" -> \"benzodiazepine\" -> \"anxiolytic effects\" -> \"not effective for ADHD symptoms\" -> 10%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Dopamine Receptor)-CAUSES->(Symptoms)-PREDISPOSES->(Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder)\n(Dopamine Receptor)-CAUSES->(Pain)-PREDISPOSES->(Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder)\n(Dopamine Receptor)-CAUSES->(imbalance)-PREDISPOSES->(Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder)\n(Norepinephrine)-TREATS->(Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder)\n(Methylphenidate)-ISA->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Norepinephrine)\n(Haloperidol)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Pathogenesis)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Receptors, Purinergic P1)-CAUSES->(Antipsychotic Effect)\n(Haloperidol)-TREATS->(Inflammation)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Receptors, Purinergic P1)-CAUSES->(Antipsychotic Effect)\n(Antipsychotic Effect)-PROCESS_OF->(Breast)-LOCATION_OF->(Pathogenesis)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Dopamine Receptor)\n(Antipsychotic Effect)-PROCESS_OF->(Breast)-LOCATION_OF->(Complication)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Dopamine Receptor)\n(Imipramine)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Antidepressive Agents)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Antidepressive Agents, Tricyclic)\n(Imipramine)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Antipsychotic Agents)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Antidepressive Agents, Tricyclic)\n(Antidepressive Agents, Tricyclic)-ISA->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Norepinephrine)\n(Antidepressive Agents, Tricyclic)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Norepinephrine)\n(Alprazolam)-TREATS->(Disease)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Virus)-LOCATION_OF->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Benzodiazepines)\n(Alprazolam)-TREATS->(Chronic Disease)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Virus)-LOCATION_OF->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Benzodiazepines)\n(Benzodiazepines)-INTERACTS_WITH->(agonists)-CAUSES->(Anti-Anxiety Effect)\n(Anti-Anxiety Effect)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-CAUSES->(Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder)\n(Anti-Anxiety Effect)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-COMPLICATES->(Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Methylphenidate is the drug of choice for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) due to its mechanism of increasing dopamine and norepinephrine levels in the brain, which improves attention and focus and reduces hyperactivity. This aligns with the consensus that stimulant medications like methylphenidate are first-line treatments for ADHD. The evidence path supports this by showing methylphenidate's interaction with norepinephrine, which is known to treat ADHD. Haloperidol, an antipsychotic, is not typically used for ADHD as it primarily blocks dopamine receptors, which is not the desired effect for treating ADHD. Imipramine, a tricyclic antidepressant, can increase norepinephrine and serotonin but is not a first-line treatment for ADHD. Alprazolam, a benzodiazepine, is used for its anxiolytic effects and is not effective for ADHD symptoms. The evidence paths related to dopamine receptors and norepinephrine support the consensus that ADHD is associated with neurotransmitter imbalances, particularly involving dopamine and norepinephrine.\"\n}\n```",
