Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Pulmonary fibrosis is a complication of: March 2011, March 2012, September 2012, March 2013\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Methotrexate\nopb. Doxorubicin\nopc. Cisplatin\nopd. Busulfan\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Methotrexate\" -> \"immunosuppressive therapy\" -> \"potential lung toxicity\" -> \"pulmonary fibrosis\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Doxorubicin\" -> \"chemotherapy agent\" -> \"cardiotoxicity\" -> \"less common lung toxicity\" -> \"pulmonary fibrosis\" -> 60%\nCHAIN: \"Cisplatin\" -> \"chemotherapy agent\" -> \"nephrotoxicity\" -> \"ototoxicity\" -> \"less common lung toxicity\" -> \"pulmonary fibrosis\" -> 55%\nCHAIN: \"Busulfan\" -> \"alkylating agent\" -> \"known lung toxicity\" -> \"pulmonary fibrosis\" -> 95%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Therapeutic immunosuppression)-CAUSES->(Disease)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(paracrine)-PROCESS_OF->(Lung)\n(Therapeutic immunosuppression)-CAUSES->(Disease)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Hearing)-PROCESS_OF->(Lung)\n(Toxic nephropathy)-CAUSES->(Kidney Diseases)-CAUSES->(Ototoxicity)\n(Toxic nephropathy)-CAUSES->(Adverse effects)-CAUSES->(Ototoxicity)\n(Toxic nephropathy)-CAUSES->(Degenerative abnormality)-CAUSES->(Ototoxicity)\n(Ototoxicity)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Hearing)-PROCESS_OF->(Lung)\n(Alkylating Agents)-CAUSES->(Graft acceptance)-PROCESS_OF->(Lung)\n(Alkylating Agents)-CAUSES->(uptake)-PROCESS_OF->(Lung)\n(Alkylating Agents)-CAUSES->(Physiological Processes)-PROCESS_OF->(Lung)\n(Methotrexate)-INTERACTS_WITH->(T-Lymphocyte)-PART_OF->(Myocardium)-LOCATION_OF->(Therapeutic immunosuppression)\n(Methotrexate)-INTERACTS_WITH->(T-Lymphocyte)-PART_OF->(Biopsy sample)-LOCATION_OF->(Therapeutic immunosuppression)\n(Lung)-LOCATION_OF->(Pulmonary Fibrosis)\n(Lung)-LOCATION_OF->(Pulmonary Fibrosis)\n(Lung)-LOCATION_OF->(Pulmonary Fibrosis)\n(Busulfan)-CAUSES->(Graft acceptance)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Melphalan)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Alkylating Agents)\n(Busulfan)-TREATS->(Functional disorder)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Melphalan)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Alkylating Agents)\n(Lung)-LOCATION_OF->(Pulmonary Fibrosis)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Pulmonary fibrosis is a known complication of certain medications, particularly those with lung toxicity. Methotrexate, an immunosuppressive agent, is associated with potential lung toxicity and can lead to pulmonary fibrosis, supported by its interaction with lung processes. Doxorubicin, primarily known for cardiotoxicity, has less common associations with lung toxicity and pulmonary fibrosis, making it a less likely cause. Cisplatin is primarily associated with nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity, with pulmonary fibrosis being a rare complication. Busulfan, an alkylating agent, is well-documented to cause lung toxicity and is strongly associated with pulmonary fibrosis. The evidence paths confirm the association of alkylating agents like Busulfan with lung processes, supporting its strong link to pulmonary fibrosis. Therefore, Busulfan is the most likely option to cause pulmonary fibrosis, followed by Methotrexate, with Doxorubicin and Cisplatin being less likely.\"\n}\n```",
