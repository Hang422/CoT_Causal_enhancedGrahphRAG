      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Choose the drug which blocks basal as well as stimulated gastric acid secretion without affecting cholinergic, histaminergic or gastrin receptors\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Loxatidine\nopb. Pirenzepine\nopc. Omeprazole\nopd. Famotidine\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Omeprazole\" -> \"proton pump inhibitor\" -> \"blocks gastric acid secretion\" -> \"does not affect cholinergic, histaminergic, or gastrin receptors\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Loxatidine\" -> \"H2 receptor antagonist\" -> \"blocks histamine-induced gastric acid secretion\" -> \"affects histaminergic receptors\" -> 60%\nCHAIN: \"Pirenzepine\" -> \"anticholinergic\" -> \"blocks cholinergic receptors\" -> \"reduces gastric acid secretion\" -> \"affects cholinergic receptors\" -> 50%\nCHAIN: \"Famotidine\" -> \"H2 receptor antagonist\" -> \"blocks histamine-induced gastric acid secretion\" -> \"affects histaminergic receptors\" -> 60%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Histamine H2 Antagonists)-TREATS->(Obstruction)\n(Anticholinergic Agents)-TREATS->(Obstruction)\n(Histamine H2 Antagonists)-TREATS->(Obstruction)\n(Omeprazole)-ISA->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Proton Pump Inhibitors)\n(Omeprazole)-INTERACTS_WITH->(CYP2C19 gene|CYP2C19)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Proton Pump Inhibitors)\n(Pirenzepine)-ISA->(Anti-Ulcer Agents)-ISA->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Anticholinergic Agents)\n(Pirenzepine)-ISA->(Anti-Ulcer Agents)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Anticholinergic Agents)\n(Famotidine)-TREATS->(2019 novel coronavirus)-LOCATION_OF->(Proton Pump Inhibitors)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Histamine H2 Antagonists)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Omeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor that effectively blocks both basal and stimulated gastric acid secretion by inhibiting the H+/K+ ATPase enzyme in the gastric parietal cells. It does not affect cholinergic, histaminergic, or gastrin receptors, aligning with the consensus that it specifically targets the final step of acid production. The evidence paths confirm its classification as a proton pump inhibitor, which supports its mechanism of action. In contrast, Loxatidine and Famotidine are H2 receptor antagonists, which block histamine-induced acid secretion and thus affect histaminergic receptors. Pirenzepine is an anticholinergic agent that reduces gastric acid secretion by affecting cholinergic receptors. Therefore, Omeprazole is the only option that meets the criteria of blocking gastric acid secretion without affecting the specified receptors.\"\n}\n```",
