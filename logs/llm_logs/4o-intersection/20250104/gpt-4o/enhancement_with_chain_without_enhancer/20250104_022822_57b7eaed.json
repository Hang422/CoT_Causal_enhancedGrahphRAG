      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Mark the true statement regarding use of Lithium in maniac-depressive psychosis?\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Monotherapy for acute episodes\nopb. Monitoring of serum concentration is not useful for guiding dose adjustment\nopc. Can result in leucocytosis\nopd. Can result in hypehyroidism on long term use\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Lithium\" -> \"used in acute manic episodes\" -> \"monotherapy possible\" -> 70%\nCHAIN: \"Lithium\" -> \"serum concentration monitoring\" -> \"guides dose adjustment\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Lithium\" -> \"increases white blood cell count\" -> \"leucocytosis\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Lithium\" -> \"long-term use\" -> \"thyroid dysfunction\" -> \"hypothyroidism\" -> 85%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Thyroid dysfunction)-CAUSES->(Hypothyroidism)\n(Lithium)-CAUSES->(Antiinflammatory Effect)-PROCESS_OF->(Bone Marrow)-LOCATION_OF->(White Blood Cell Count procedure)\n(Lithium)-CAUSES->(Antiinflammatory Effect)-PROCESS_OF->(Peritoneum)-LOCATION_OF->(White Blood Cell Count procedure)\n(White Blood Cell Count procedure)-DIAGNOSES->(Leukocytosis)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Lithium is commonly used in the management of manic episodes in bipolar disorder, but it is typically not used as monotherapy for acute episodes due to the need for rapid stabilization, often requiring additional medications. Monitoring of serum lithium concentration is crucial for guiding dose adjustment to ensure therapeutic efficacy and avoid toxicity, contradicting the claim that it is not useful. Lithium can indeed cause an increase in white blood cell count, leading to leucocytosis, which is supported by evidence linking lithium to changes in bone marrow activity. Long-term use of lithium is associated with thyroid dysfunction, most commonly resulting in hypothyroidism rather than hyperthyroidism, aligning with standard medical consensus.\"\n}\n```",
