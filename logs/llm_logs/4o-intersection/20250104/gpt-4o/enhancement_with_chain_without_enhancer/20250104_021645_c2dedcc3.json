Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        The placenta secretes a hormone that is utilized in the early detection of pregnancy. This hormone is:\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Endothelial growth factor (EGF)\nopb. Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG)\nopc. Human chorionic somatotropin (HCS)\nopd. Relaxin\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Placenta\" -> \"secretes hormone\" -> \"hCG\" -> \"early detection of pregnancy\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Placenta\" -> \"secretes hormone\" -> \"hCG\" -> \"detected in urine\" -> \"pregnancy test\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Placenta\" -> \"secretes hormone\" -> \"hCG\" -> \"detected in blood\" -> \"early pregnancy confirmation\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Placenta\" -> \"secretes hormone\" -> \"hCG\" -> \"rises in early pregnancy\" -> \"used in pregnancy tests\" -> 95%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Human Chorionic Gonadotropin)-CAUSES->(Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome)-COMPLICATES->(early pregnancy)\n(Human Chorionic Gonadotropin)-TREATS->(Disease)-CAUSES->(early pregnancy)\n(Human Chorionic Gonadotropin)-TREATS->(Pre-Eclampsia)-CAUSES->(early pregnancy)\n(Human Chorionic Gonadotropin)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cells)-LOCATION_OF->(Early Diagnosis)\n(Human Chorionic Gonadotropin)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cultured Cells)-LOCATION_OF->(Early Diagnosis)\n(Human Chorionic Gonadotropin)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cells)-PART_OF->(Blood)\n(Human Chorionic Gonadotropin)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cultured Cells)-PART_OF->(Blood)\n(Blood)-LOCATION_OF->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-TREATS->(early pregnancy)\n(Blood)-LOCATION_OF->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-PREDISPOSES->(early pregnancy)\n(early pregnancy)-CAUSES->(Fetal Growth Retardation)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Genes)-PART_OF->(Endometrium)-LOCATION_OF->(Pregnancy Tests)\n(early pregnancy)-COMPLICATES->(Fetal Growth Retardation)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Genes)-PART_OF->(Endometrium)-LOCATION_OF->(Pregnancy Tests)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"The hormone secreted by the placenta that is utilized in the early detection of pregnancy is human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). This is supported by the consensus that hCG is produced by the placenta shortly after implantation and is detectable in both blood and urine, making it the primary hormone used in pregnancy tests. The reasoning chains correctly identify hCG as the hormone linked to early pregnancy detection, as it rises significantly in early pregnancy and is the target of most pregnancy tests. The retrieved evidence paths, while broad, confirm that hCG interacts with cells and is part of blood, which aligns with its role in early pregnancy detection through blood tests. Other options, such as endothelial growth factor (EGF), human chorionic somatotropin (HCS), and relaxin, do not play a primary role in early pregnancy detection.\"\n}\n```",
