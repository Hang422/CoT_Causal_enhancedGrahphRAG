      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Biochemistry.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        HMP shunt occurs in all organs except ?\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Liver\nopb. Adipose tissue\nopc. RBC\nopd. Brain\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"HMP shunt\" -> \"occurs in liver\" -> \"liver has high metabolic activity\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"HMP shunt\" -> \"occurs in adipose tissue\" -> \"adipose tissue requires NADPH for fatty acid synthesis\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"HMP shunt\" -> \"occurs in RBC\" -> \"RBC requires NADPH for maintaining reduced glutathione\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"HMP shunt\" -> \"occurs in brain\" -> \"brain requires NADPH for biosynthetic reactions\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"HMP shunt\" -> \"does not occur in RBC\" -> \"RBC lacks mitochondria\" -> \"RBC relies on glycolysis\" -> 95%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Erythrocytes)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Glutathione)\n(Erythrocytes)-INTERACTS_WITH->(ATP8A2 gene|ATP8A2)-PART_OF->(Mitochondria)\n(Erythrocytes)-LOCATION_OF->(ATP8A2 gene|ATP8A2)-PART_OF->(Mitochondria)\n(Mitochondria)-PART_OF->(Erythrocytes)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"The Hexose Monophosphate (HMP) shunt, also known as the pentose phosphate pathway, is present in most cells as it provides NADPH for reductive biosynthesis and ribose-5-phosphate for nucleotide synthesis. In the liver, adipose tissue, and brain, the HMP shunt is active due to their need for NADPH in fatty acid synthesis and other biosynthetic processes. In red blood cells (RBCs), the HMP shunt is crucial for generating NADPH to maintain reduced glutathione, which protects against oxidative damage. The reasoning chain suggesting the absence of the HMP shunt in RBCs due to the lack of mitochondria is incorrect, as the HMP shunt is a cytosolic process and does not require mitochondria. Therefore, the HMP shunt occurs in RBCs despite their lack of mitochondria. The correct answer is that the HMP shunt occurs in all the listed organs, including RBCs, and the question may be misleading as it implies an exception that does not exist in the given options.\"\n}\n```",
