      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Which is an uricosuric drug-\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Allopurinol\nopb. Probenecid\nopc. Indomethacin\nopd. Aspirin\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Probenecid\" -> \"increases renal excretion of uric acid\" -> \"reduces serum uric acid levels\" -> \"uricosuric effect\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Allopurinol\" -> \"inhibits xanthine oxidase\" -> \"decreases uric acid production\" -> \"not primarily uricosuric\" -> 60%\nCHAIN: \"Indomethacin\" -> \"non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug\" -> \"reduces inflammation\" -> \"not uricosuric\" -> 50%\nCHAIN: \"Aspirin\" -> \"low doses decrease uric acid excretion\" -> \"high doses increase uric acid excretion\" -> \"inconsistent uricosuric effect\" -> 55%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal)-CAUSES->(Inflammation)\n(Aspirin)-PREDISPOSES->(Kidney Failure, Chronic)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Excretory function)\n(Aspirin)-PREDISPOSES->(Inflammation)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Excretory function)\n(Aspirin)-TREATS->(Disease)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Excretory function)\n(Allopurinol)-TREATS->(Ischemia)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Xanthine Oxidase)\n(Allopurinol)-PREVENTS->(Ischemia)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Xanthine Oxidase)\n(Indomethacin)-ISA->(Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Probenecid is a uricosuric drug because it increases the renal excretion of uric acid, thereby reducing serum uric acid levels. This aligns with the consensus that uricosuric drugs promote the excretion of uric acid. Allopurinol, while used in the management of gout, primarily works by inhibiting xanthine oxidase to decrease uric acid production, not by increasing its excretion, and thus is not classified as uricosuric. Indomethacin is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that reduces inflammation but does not have a uricosuric effect. Aspirin has a complex relationship with uric acid excretion: low doses can decrease excretion, while high doses may increase it, leading to an inconsistent uricosuric effect. Therefore, Probenecid is the correct answer as the uricosuric drug.\"\n}\n```",
