      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Which of the following does not cause Insulin release-\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Rosiglitazone\nopb. Nateglinide\nopc. Glimipiride\nopd. Tobutamide\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Rosiglitazone\" -> \"PPAR-gamma activation\" -> \"increased insulin sensitivity\" -> \"no direct insulin release\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Nateglinide\" -> \"stimulates pancreatic beta cells\" -> \"insulin release\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Glimipiride\" -> \"stimulates pancreatic beta cells\" -> \"insulin release\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Tolbutamide\" -> \"stimulates pancreatic beta cells\" -> \"insulin release\" -> 90%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(insulin sensitivity)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Insulin)\n(nateglinide)-TREATS->(Hyperglycemia)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Virus)-LOCATION_OF->(Lipopolysaccharides)-PART_OF->(Structure of beta Cell of islet)\n(nateglinide)-TREATS->(Diabetes)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Virus)-LOCATION_OF->(Lipopolysaccharides)-PART_OF->(Structure of beta Cell of islet)\n(Structure of beta Cell of islet)-LOCATION_OF->(Insulin)\n(Structure of beta Cell of islet)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Insulin)\n(Structure of beta Cell of islet)-LOCATION_OF->(Insulin)\n(Structure of beta Cell of islet)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Insulin)\n(Tolbutamide)-PART_OF->(Adipocytes)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Structure of beta Cell of islet)\n(Structure of beta Cell of islet)-LOCATION_OF->(Insulin)\n(Structure of beta Cell of islet)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Insulin)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Rosiglitazone does not directly cause insulin release. It works by activating PPAR-gamma, which increases insulin sensitivity, but does not stimulate pancreatic beta cells to release insulin. This aligns with the consensus that thiazolidinediones like Rosiglitazone improve insulin sensitivity rather than directly causing insulin secretion. In contrast, Nateglinide, Glimipiride, and Tolbutamide are known to stimulate pancreatic beta cells, leading to insulin release. The evidence paths confirm that Nateglinide and Tolbutamide interact with the structure of beta cells, which are responsible for insulin secretion. Therefore, the correct answer is Rosiglitazone, as it does not directly cause insulin release.\"\n}\n```",
