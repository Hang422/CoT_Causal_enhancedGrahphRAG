      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Topical immunomodulator used for the treatment of genital was is:\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Imiquimod\nopb. Podophylline\nopc. Interferon\nopd. Acyclovir\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Imiquimod\" -> \"topical application\" -> \"immune response activation\" -> \"treatment of genital warts\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Podophylline\" -> \"topical application\" -> \"cytotoxic effect\" -> \"treatment of genital warts\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Interferon\" -> \"immune response modulation\" -> \"possible treatment of genital warts\" -> 70%\nCHAIN: \"Acyclovir\" -> \"antiviral activity\" -> \"treatment of herpes simplex virus\" -> \"not typically used for genital warts\" -> 60%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Simplexvirus)-CAUSES->(Infection)-CAUSES->(Anogenital venereal warts)\n(Simplexvirus)-CAUSES->(Virus Diseases)-CAUSES->(Anogenital venereal warts)\n(Simplexvirus)-CAUSES->(Genital infection)-CAUSES->(Anogenital venereal warts)\n(imiquimod)-TREATS->(Inflammatory Response)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Genes)-PART_OF->(Endothelium)-LOCATION_OF->(topical application)\n(imiquimod)-TREATS->(Functional disorder)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Genes)-PART_OF->(Endothelium)-LOCATION_OF->(topical application)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Imiquimod is a topical immunomodulator that activates the immune response and is used for the treatment of genital warts, aligning with standard medical consensus. Podophylline is also used topically for genital warts but acts through a cytotoxic mechanism rather than immunomodulation. Interferon can modulate the immune response and has been used in some cases for genital warts, but it is not the primary treatment. Acyclovir is an antiviral used for herpes simplex virus infections and is not typically used for genital warts. The evidence paths confirm that imiquimod is associated with immune response activation and topical application, supporting its use in treating genital warts.\"\n}\n```",
