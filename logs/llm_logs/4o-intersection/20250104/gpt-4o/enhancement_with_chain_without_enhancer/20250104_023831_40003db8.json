      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Anticoagulant of choice for prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism in patient with cancer surgery is:-\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Heparin sulfate\nopb. Protamine sulfate\nopc. Low molecular weight heparin\nopd. Warfarin\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Cancer surgery\" -> \"increased risk of venous thromboembolism\" -> \"need for anticoagulation\" -> \"Low molecular weight heparin\" -> \"effective prophylaxis\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Cancer surgery\" -> \"increased risk of venous thromboembolism\" -> \"need for anticoagulation\" -> \"Heparin sulfate\" -> \"effective but less convenient than LMWH\" -> 70%\nCHAIN: \"Cancer surgery\" -> \"increased risk of venous thromboembolism\" -> \"need for anticoagulation\" -> \"Warfarin\" -> \"requires monitoring, not ideal for immediate prophylaxis\" -> 50%\nCHAIN: \"Cancer surgery\" -> \"increased risk of venous thromboembolism\" -> \"need for anticoagulation\" -> \"Protamine sulfate\" -> \"not an anticoagulant, used to reverse heparin\" -> 10%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Venous Thromboembolism)-CAUSES->(Shock)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Genes)-PART_OF->(Endothelium)-LOCATION_OF->(anticoagulation)\n(Venous Thromboembolism)-CAUSES->(Cardiovascular Diseases)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Genes)-PART_OF->(Endothelium)-LOCATION_OF->(anticoagulation)\n(anticoagulation)-CAUSES->(Thrombosis)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Heparin, Low-Molecular-Weight)\n(anticoagulation)-PREVENTS->(Thrombosis)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Heparin, Low-Molecular-Weight)\n(Venous Thromboembolism)-CAUSES->(Shock)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Genes)-PART_OF->(Endothelium)-LOCATION_OF->(anticoagulation)\n(Venous Thromboembolism)-CAUSES->(Cardiovascular Diseases)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Genes)-PART_OF->(Endothelium)-LOCATION_OF->(anticoagulation)\n(Venous Thromboembolism)-CAUSES->(Shock)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Genes)-PART_OF->(Endothelium)-LOCATION_OF->(anticoagulation)\n(Venous Thromboembolism)-CAUSES->(Cardiovascular Diseases)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Genes)-PART_OF->(Endothelium)-LOCATION_OF->(anticoagulation)\n(anticoagulation)-CAUSES->(Thrombosis)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Warfarin)\n(anticoagulation)-PREVENTS->(Thrombosis)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Warfarin)\n(Venous Thromboembolism)-CAUSES->(Shock)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Genes)-PART_OF->(Endothelium)-LOCATION_OF->(anticoagulation)\n(Venous Thromboembolism)-CAUSES->(Cardiovascular Diseases)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Genes)-PART_OF->(Endothelium)-LOCATION_OF->(anticoagulation)\n(anticoagulation)-CAUSES->(Disease)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Antiinflammatory Effect)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Protamine Sulfate)\n(anticoagulation)-PREVENTS->(Disease)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Antiinflammatory Effect)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Protamine Sulfate)\n(Protamine Sulfate)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cells)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Anticoagulants)\n(Protamine Sulfate)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cells)-LOCATION_OF->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Anticoagulants)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"For prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism in patients undergoing cancer surgery, the standard consensus is to use low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) due to its effectiveness and convenience compared to unfractionated heparin. LMWH is preferred because it has a more predictable pharmacokinetic profile, does not require routine monitoring, and has a lower risk of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. The evidence paths support the association of LMWH with effective thrombosis prevention. Heparin sulfate is effective but less convenient than LMWH. Warfarin is not ideal for immediate prophylaxis due to the need for monitoring and delayed onset of action. Protamine sulfate is not an anticoagulant; it is used to reverse the effects of heparin, making it irrelevant for prophylaxis. Therefore, the anticoagulant of choice is low molecular weight heparin.\"\n}\n```",
