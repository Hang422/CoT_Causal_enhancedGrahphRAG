      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Biochemistry.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        The function of vitamin A is/are related to which of the following?\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Retinol\nopb. Retinal\nopc. Retinoic acids\nopd. All of the above\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Vitamin A\" -> \"converted to Retinol\" -> \"supports vision and immune function\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Vitamin A\" -> \"converted to Retinal\" -> \"essential for vision\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Vitamin A\" -> \"converted to Retinoic acids\" -> \"regulates gene expression\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Vitamin A\" -> \"Retinol\" -> \"Retinal\" -> \"Retinoic acids\" -> \"all related functions\" -> 95%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Vitamin A)-CAUSES->(Disease)-CAUSES->(arterial stiffness)-PROCESS_OF->(Retina)\n(Vitamin A)-CAUSES->(Disease)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(paracrine)-PROCESS_OF->(Retina)\n(Vitamin A)-CAUSES->(Disease)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(uptake)-PROCESS_OF->(Retina)\n(Vitamin A)-CAUSES->(Disease)-CAUSES->(arterial stiffness)-PROCESS_OF->(Retina)\n(Vitamin A)-CAUSES->(Disease)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(paracrine)-PROCESS_OF->(Retina)\n(Vitamin A)-CAUSES->(Disease)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(uptake)-PROCESS_OF->(Retina)\n(Vitamin A)-PART_OF->(Cells)-LOCATION_OF->(Retinoids)\n(Vitamin A)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cultured Cells)-LOCATION_OF->(Retinoids)\n(Retina)-PART_OF->(Liver)-LOCATION_OF->(Retinoids)\n(Retina)-PART_OF->(Tract)-LOCATION_OF->(Retinoids)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Vitamin A functions are related to retinol, retinal, and retinoic acids. Retinol is a form of vitamin A that supports vision and immune function. Retinal, derived from retinol, is essential for vision, particularly in the conversion of light into signals in the retina. Retinoic acids, another derivative, play a crucial role in regulating gene expression and cellular differentiation. The reasoning chain for each option aligns with the consensus that vitamin A is involved in these processes. The evidence paths, while broad, confirm the presence and role of retinoids in cellular processes, supporting the comprehensive role of vitamin A in these functions. Therefore, the correct answer is that vitamin A is related to all of the above: retinol, retinal, and retinoic acids.\"\n}\n```",
