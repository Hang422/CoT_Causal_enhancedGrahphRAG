      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Folic acid metabolism is inhibited by :  a) Sulfonamides b) Methotrexate c) Nitrous oxide d) Trimethoprim e) 5–Flucytosine\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. acd\nopb. abd\nopc. bde\nopd. ace\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Sulfonamides\" -> \"inhibit dihydropteroate synthase\" -> \"decreased folate synthesis\" -> \"inhibited folic acid metabolism\" -> 80%\nCHAIN: \"Methotrexate\" -> \"inhibits dihydrofolate reductase\" -> \"decreased tetrahydrofolate\" -> \"inhibited folic acid metabolism\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Nitrous oxide\" -> \"oxidizes vitamin B12\" -> \"impaired methionine synthase\" -> \"inhibited folic acid metabolism\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Trimethoprim\" -> \"inhibits dihydrofolate reductase\" -> \"decreased tetrahydrofolate\" -> \"inhibited folic acid metabolism\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"5-Flucytosine\" -> \"converted to 5-fluorouracil\" -> \"inhibits thymidylate synthase\" -> \"possible folate pathway interference\" -> 70%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Methotrexate)-TREATS->(Hypertension, Pulmonary)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Dihydrofolate Reductase)\n(Nitrous Oxide)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(APP gene)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Vitamin B 12)\n(Nitrous Oxide)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Alleles)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Vitamin B 12)\n(Vitamin B 12)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Genes)-PART_OF->(Cells)-INTERACTS_WITH->(5-Methyltetrahydrofolate-Homocysteine S-Methyltransferase)\n(Vitamin B 12)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Genes)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cells)-INTERACTS_WITH->(5-Methyltetrahydrofolate-Homocysteine S-Methyltransferase)\n(Trimethoprim)-TREATS->(Hypersensitivity)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Dihydrofolate Reductase)\n(Fluorouracil)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Thymidylate Synthase)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Folic acid metabolism can be inhibited by several agents through different mechanisms. Methotrexate is well-known to inhibit dihydrofolate reductase, leading to decreased tetrahydrofolate and thus inhibiting folic acid metabolism, which is strongly supported by consensus and evidence. Trimethoprim also inhibits dihydrofolate reductase, similarly affecting folic acid metabolism. Nitrous oxide oxidizes vitamin B12, impairing methionine synthase, which indirectly affects folate metabolism, supported by evidence paths showing interactions with vitamin B12. Sulfonamides inhibit dihydropteroate synthase, leading to decreased folate synthesis, which can be considered an indirect inhibition of folic acid metabolism. 5-Flucytosine, converted to 5-fluorouracil, inhibits thymidylate synthase, but its effect on folate metabolism is less direct and not strongly supported by consensus for this specific question. Therefore, the most consensus-aligned inhibitors of folic acid metabolism are Methotrexate, Trimethoprim, and Nitrous Oxide, making option 'opb. abd' the best choice.\"\n}\n```",
