      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4.

Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Finasteride is a 5α reductase inhibitor that effectively reduces dihydrotestosterone (DHT) levels, leading to decreased prostate size and improved symptoms of benign prostatic hypertrophy. It also reduces hair follicle miniaturization, improving male pattern baldness. Flutamide, an androgen receptor blocker, has unclear effects on hair and prostate. Prazosin, an alpha-1 adrenergic receptor blocker, improves urinary symptoms in benign prostatic hypertrophy but has no effect on hair. Minoxidil, a vasodilator, increases blood flow to hair follicles, improving male pattern baldness but has no effect on the prostate. The evidence paths confirm the role of DHT in hair follicle structure and prostate function, supporting the effectiveness of finasteride in both conditions.\"\n}\n```",
