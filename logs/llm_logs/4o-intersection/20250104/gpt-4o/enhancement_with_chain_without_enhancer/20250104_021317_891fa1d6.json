      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Which of the following antitussive can lead to hallucinations\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Morphine\nopb. Dextromethorphan\nopc. Diphenhydramine\nopd. Aprepitant\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Dextromethorphan\" -> \"NMDA receptor antagonism\" -> \"altered neurotransmission\" -> \"hallucinations\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Morphine\" -> \"opioid receptor activation\" -> \"central nervous system effects\" -> \"possible hallucinations\" -> 70%\nCHAIN: \"Diphenhydramine\" -> \"anticholinergic effects\" -> \"central nervous system effects\" -> \"possible hallucinations\" -> 60%\nCHAIN: \"Aprepitant\" -> \"neurokinin-1 receptor antagonism\" -> \"antiemetic effects\" -> \"unlikely hallucinations\" -> 40%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Substance P Receptor)-CAUSES->(Vomiting)-CAUSES->(Malnutrition)-PREDISPOSES->(Pica Disease)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Antiemetic Effect)\n(Substance P Receptor)-CAUSES->(Sleep disturbances)-PREDISPOSES->(Malnutrition)-PREDISPOSES->(Pica Disease)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Antiemetic Effect)\n(Substance P Receptor)-CAUSES->(Seizures)-PREDISPOSES->(Malnutrition)-PREDISPOSES->(Pica Disease)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Antiemetic Effect)\n(Dextromethorphan)-TREATS->(Complication)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(N-Methyl-D-Aspartate Receptors)\n(Dextromethorphan)-TREATS->(Functional disorder)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(N-Methyl-D-Aspartate Receptors)\n(aprepitant)-PREVENTS->(Inflammation)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Substance P Receptor)\n(Antiemetic Effect)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-CAUSES->(Hallucinations)\n(Antiemetic Effect)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-TREATS->(Hallucinations)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Dextromethorphan is known to cause hallucinations due to its action as an NMDA receptor antagonist, which alters neurotransmission. This aligns with the consensus that NMDA receptor antagonism can lead to dissociative effects, including hallucinations. The evidence path supports this by associating dextromethorphan with NMDA receptors. Morphine, while primarily an opioid receptor agonist, can cause central nervous system effects, including hallucinations, but this is less common and typically associated with higher doses or specific patient susceptibilities. Diphenhydramine, an antihistamine with anticholinergic properties, can cause central nervous system effects such as confusion or hallucinations, particularly in the elderly or at high doses, but this is not its primary effect. Aprepitant, a neurokinin-1 receptor antagonist used as an antiemetic, is unlikely to cause hallucinations, as its primary action does not involve pathways typically associated with such effects. The evidence paths related to aprepitant focus on its antiemetic effects and do not support a link to hallucinations.\"\n}\n```",
