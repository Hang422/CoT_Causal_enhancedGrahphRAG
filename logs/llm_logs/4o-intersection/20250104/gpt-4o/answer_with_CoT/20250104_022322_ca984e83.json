Single dose in ascariasis\nopb. Immunostimulant\nopc. Paralysis of worms by depolarisation\nopd. Immunodepressant in high doses\n\n### Reasoning Chains for Validation:\n- CHAIN: \"Levamisole\" -> \"used as single dose in ascariasis\" -> \"effective treatment\" -> 90%\n- CHAIN: \"Levamisole\" -> \"acts as immunostimulant\" -> \"enhances immune response\" -> 90%\n- CHAIN: \"Levamisole\" -> \"causes paralysis of worms\" -> \"depolarisation of worm muscles\" -> 90%\n- CHAIN: \"Levamisole\" -> \"immunodepressant in high doses\" -> \"possible but not widely accepted\" -> 60%\n\n### Retrieved Validation Paths:\n- (Levamisole)-TREATS->(Disease)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Immunity)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Immunologic Adjuvants)\n- (Levamisole)-TREATS->(Disease)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Antiinflammatory Effect)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Immunologic Adjuvants)\n- (Levamisole)-TREATS->(Ascariasis)\n\n            ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3.

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Levamisole is a medication with multiple uses. It is known to be effective as a single-dose treatment for ascariasis, a common parasitic worm infection, due to its ability to cause paralysis of worms through depolarization of their muscles. Additionally, levamisole has been used as an immunostimulant, enhancing the immune response, particularly in certain cancer treatments. However, the use of levamisole as an immunodepressant in high doses is not a widely recognized or accepted application. While high doses of many drugs can have unexpected effects, the primary and well-documented uses of levamisole do not include immunosuppression. Therefore, the option that does not align with the standard uses of levamisole is 'immunodepressant in high doses.'\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
