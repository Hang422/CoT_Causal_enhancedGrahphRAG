  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Tocilizumab is a monoclonal antibody specifically designed to target the interleukin-6 receptor (IL-6R). By binding to the IL-6 receptor, tocilizumab prevents interleukin-6 (IL-6) from interacting with its receptor, thereby inhibiting the IL-6 signaling pathway. This action reduces inflammation and is effective in treating conditions like rheumatoid arthritis. The reasoning chains consistently indicate that tocilizumab targets the interleukin-6 receptor, and there is no evidence suggesting it targets interleukin-5 or its receptor. Therefore, the most likely correct option is that tocilizumab is a monoclonal antibody against the interleukin-6 receptor.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
