  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Hyperprolactinemia is a condition characterized by elevated levels of prolactin in the blood. It is commonly associated with medications that block dopamine receptors, as dopamine normally inhibits prolactin secretion. Metoclopramide is a dopamine receptor antagonist, which means it blocks dopamine receptors, leading to increased prolactin secretion and thus hyperprolactinemia. Bromocriptine, on the other hand, is a dopamine agonist and would decrease prolactin levels. Levodopa and Amantadine both increase dopamine activity, which would also decrease prolactin levels. Therefore, based on the mechanism of action and the known side effects of these drugs, Metoclopramide is the most likely to cause hyperprolactinemia.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
