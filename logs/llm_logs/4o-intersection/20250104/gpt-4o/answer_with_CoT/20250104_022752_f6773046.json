Ascaris\nopb. Filariasis\nopc. Malaria\nopd. Oncocerciasis\n\n### Reasoning Chains for Validation:\n- CHAIN: \"Ivermectin\" -> \"effective against Ascaris\" -> \"indicated for Ascaris\" -> 95%\n- CHAIN: \"Ivermectin\" -> \"effective against Filariasis\" -> \"indicated for Filariasis\" -> 95%\n- CHAIN: \"Ivermectin\" -> \"not effective against Malaria\" -> \"not indicated for Malaria\" -> 98%\n- CHAIN: \"Ivermectin\" -> \"effective against Oncocerciasis\" -> \"indicated for Oncocerciasis\" -> 95%\n\n### Retrieved Validation Paths:\n- (Ivermectin)-TREATS->(Filariasis)\n\n            ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n                \n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n            "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Ivermectin is an antiparasitic medication primarily used to treat infections caused by certain parasites. It is effective against Ascaris (a type of roundworm), Filariasis (caused by filarial worms), and Oncocerciasis (river blindness caused by Onchocerca volvulus). However, Ivermectin is not effective against Malaria, which is caused by Plasmodium parasites transmitted by mosquitoes. Malaria requires antimalarial drugs such as chloroquine, artemisinin-based combination therapies, or others specifically targeting Plasmodium species. Therefore, Ivermectin is not indicated for the treatment of Malaria.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opc\",\n  \"confidence\": 98\n}\n```",
