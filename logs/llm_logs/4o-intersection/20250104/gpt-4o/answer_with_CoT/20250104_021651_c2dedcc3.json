This hormone is:\n\n            ### Options\n            opa. Endothelial growth factor (EGF)\nopb. Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG)\nopc. Human chorionic somatotropin (HCS)\nopd. Relaxin\n\n### Reasoning Chains for Validation:\n- CHAIN: \"Placenta\" -> \"secretes hormone\" -> \"hCG\" -> \"early detection of pregnancy\" -> 95%\n- CHAIN: \"Placenta\" -> \"secretes hormone\" -> \"hCG\" -> \"detected in urine\" -> \"pregnancy test\" -> 90%\n- CHAIN: \"Placenta\" -> \"secretes hormone\" -> \"hCG\" -> \"detected in blood\" -> \"early pregnancy confirmation\" -> 90%\n- CHAIN: \"Placenta\" -> \"secretes hormone\" -> \"hCG\" -> \"rises in early pregnancy\" -> \"used in pregnancy tests\" -> 95%\n\n### Retrieved Validation Paths:\n- (Human Chorionic Gonadotropin)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cells)-LOCATION_OF->(Early Diagnosis)\n- (Human Chorionic Gonadotropin)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cultured Cells)-LOCATION_OF->(Early Diagnosis)\n- (Human Chorionic Gonadotropin)-CAUSES->(Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome)-COMPLICATES->(early pregnancy)\n- (Human Chorionic Gonadotropin)-TREATS->(Disease)-CAUSES->(early pregnancy)\n- (Human Chorionic Gonadotropin)-TREATS->(Pre-Eclampsia)-CAUSES->(early pregnancy)\n\n            ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n                \n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n            "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The placenta secretes several hormones, but the one most commonly associated with early detection of pregnancy is human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). hCG is produced by the placenta shortly after the embryo attaches to the uterine lining. Its presence in blood and urine is the basis for most pregnancy tests. The other hormones listed, such as endothelial growth factor (EGF), human chorionic somatotropin (HCS), and relaxin, are not used for early pregnancy detection. EGF is involved in cell growth, HCS (also known as human placental lactogen) is involved in metabolic processes during pregnancy, and relaxin helps in preparing the body for childbirth. Therefore, based on standard medical knowledge and consensus, hCG is the hormone utilized in early pregnancy detection.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 98\n}\n```",
