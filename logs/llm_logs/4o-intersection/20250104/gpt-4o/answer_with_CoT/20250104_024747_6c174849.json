Protein linked with glycosidic bond\nopb. Core protein\nopc. Sugar residues are long in carbohydrate poion of glycoprotein\nopd. None\n\n### Reasoning Chains for Validation:\n- CHAIN: \"Glycoprotein\" -> \"Protein linked with glycosidic bond\" -> 90%\n- CHAIN: \"Glycoprotein\" -> \"Core protein\" -> \"Possible\" -> 60%\n- CHAIN: \"Glycoprotein\" -> \"Sugar residues\" -> \"Long carbohydrate portion\" -> \"Unclear\" -> 50%\n- CHAIN: \"Glycoprotein\" -> \"None of the above\" -> \"Unlikely\" -> 40%\n\n### Retrieved Validation Paths:\n- (Glycoproteins)-INTERACTS_WITH/PART_OF->(Cells)-LOCATION_OF->(Proteins)\n\n            ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3.

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Glycoproteins are proteins that have carbohydrate groups attached to the polypeptide chain. The attachment of these carbohydrate groups is typically through glycosidic bonds, which is a defining characteristic of glycoproteins. The term 'core protein' is more commonly associated with proteoglycans, where a core protein is heavily glycosylated with long chains of glycosaminoglycans. In glycoproteins, the carbohydrate portion is usually shorter and not as extensive as in proteoglycans. Therefore, the most accurate description of a glycoprotein from the given options is that it is a protein linked with a glycosidic bond. This aligns with the standard biochemical understanding of glycoproteins.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}\n```",
