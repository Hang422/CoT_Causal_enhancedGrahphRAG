  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Finasteride is a 5α reductase inhibitor that works by decreasing the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT). This reduction in DHT levels leads to a decrease in prostate size, which helps alleviate symptoms of benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH). Additionally, lower DHT levels reduce hair follicle miniaturization, which is a key factor in male pattern baldness (androgenetic alopecia). Therefore, finasteride is effective in treating both BPH and male pattern baldness. Flutamide is an androgen receptor blocker, which does not directly affect DHT levels. Prazosin is an alpha-1 adrenergic receptor blocker used for BPH but has no effect on hair. Minoxidil is a vasodilator used for male pattern baldness but does not affect the prostate. Based on this analysis, finasteride is the most appropriate choice.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
