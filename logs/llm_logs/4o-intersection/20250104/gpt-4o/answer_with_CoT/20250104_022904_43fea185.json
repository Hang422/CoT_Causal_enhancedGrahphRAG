It is a H2 blocker used in peptic ulcer disease\nopb. It has 100% Bioavailability\nopc. It also enhances gastric emptying\nopd. It can also lead to tachycardia\n\n### Reasoning Chains for Validation:\n- CHAIN: \"Nizatidine\" -> \"H2 blocker\" -> \"used in peptic ulcer disease\" -> 95%\n- CHAIN: \"Nizatidine\" -> \"bioavailability\" -> \"less than -> 100%\n- CHAIN: \"Nizatidine\" -> \"enhances gastric emptying\" -> \"possible\" -> 60%\n- CHAIN: \"Nizatidine\" -> \"side effects\" -> \"tachycardia\" -> 70%\n\n### Retrieved Validation Paths:\n- (Nizatidine)-TREATS->(Disease)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Virus)-LOCATION_OF->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Histamine H2 Antagonists)\n\n            ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n                \n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n            "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Nizatidine is a well-known H2 receptor antagonist used in the treatment of peptic ulcer disease, which aligns with option opa. The bioavailability of Nizatidine is high but not 100%, which makes option opb incorrect. There is limited evidence to suggest that Nizatidine enhances gastric emptying, making option opc less likely to be true. Tachycardia is a possible side effect of H2 blockers, including Nizatidine, which supports option opd. Therefore, the statement that Nizatidine has 100% bioavailability is incorrect.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}\n```",
