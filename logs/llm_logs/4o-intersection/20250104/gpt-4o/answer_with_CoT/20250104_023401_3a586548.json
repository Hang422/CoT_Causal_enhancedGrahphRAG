  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The digestion of disaccharides primarily occurs in the small intestine. Disaccharides such as sucrose, lactose, and maltose are broken down into monosaccharides by specific enzymes like sucrase, lactase, and maltase, which are present in the brush border of the small intestine. In the mouth, there is no significant digestion of disaccharides as salivary amylase primarily acts on starches. The stomach's acidic environment does not facilitate the digestion of disaccharides either. While some bacterial fermentation of disaccharides can occur in the large intestine, it is not the primary site for their digestion. Therefore, the small intestine is the most likely and widely accepted site for disaccharide digestion.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opc\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
