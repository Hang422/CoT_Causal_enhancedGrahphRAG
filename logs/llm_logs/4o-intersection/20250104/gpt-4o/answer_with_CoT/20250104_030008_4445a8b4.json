Quinine\nopb. Chloroquine\nopc. Mefloquine\nopd. Atovaquone\n\n### Reasoning Chains for Validation:\n- CHAIN: \"Chloroquine\" -> \"accumulation in retinal pigment epithelium\" -> \"retinal pigmentation\" -> 95%\n- CHAIN: \"Quinine\" -> \"possible retinal toxicity\" -> \"unclear effect on pigmentation\" -> 40%\n- CHAIN: \"Mefloquine\" -> \"no known effect on retinal pigmentation\" -> 10%\n- CHAIN: \"Atovaquone\" -> \"no known effect on retinal pigmentation\" -> 10%\n\n### Retrieved Validation Paths:\n- (Chloroquine)-TREATS->(Disease)-CAUSES->(arterial stiffness)-PROCESS_OF->(Retina)\n- (Chloroquine)-TREATS->(Disease)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(uptake)-PROCESS_OF->(Retina)\n- (Chloroquine)-TREATS->(Disease)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(biological adaptation to stress)-PROCESS_OF->(Retina)\n- (Quinine)-TREATS->(Disease)-CAUSES->(arterial stiffness)-PROCESS_OF->(Retina)\n- (Quinine)-TREATS->(Disease)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(uptake)-PROCESS_OF->(Retina)\n- (Quinine)-TREATS->(Disease)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(biological adaptation to stress)-PROCESS_OF->(Retina)\n- (Mefloquine)-TREATS->(Symptoms)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(voltage gated channel)-PROCESS_OF->(Retina)\n\n            ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n                \n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n            "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Chloroquine is well-documented to cause retinal pigmentation due to its accumulation in the retinal pigment epithelium. This can lead to a condition known as chloroquine retinopathy, characterized by changes in the retina, including pigmentation. Quinine, while it can cause retinal toxicity, does not have a well-established link to causing retinal pigmentation. Mefloquine and Atovaquone do not have known effects on retinal pigmentation. Therefore, based on standard medical knowledge and consensus, chloroquine is the most likely cause of retinal pigmentation among the options provided.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
