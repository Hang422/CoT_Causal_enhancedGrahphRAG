Acyclovir\nopb. Vidarabine\nopc. Ganciclovir\nopd.

Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3.

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Herpes simplex encephalitis is caused by the herpes simplex virus, which requires antiviral treatment. Acyclovir is the standard and most effective treatment for this condition, making it a common choice. Vidarabine was used in the past but has largely been replaced by Acyclovir due to better efficacy and safety profiles. Ganciclovir is primarily used for cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections and is not typically used for herpes simplex encephalitis. Amantadine is an antiviral used for influenza A and has no role in the treatment of herpes simplex virus infections. Therefore, the drug that is not used for herpes simplex encephalitis is Amantadine.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
