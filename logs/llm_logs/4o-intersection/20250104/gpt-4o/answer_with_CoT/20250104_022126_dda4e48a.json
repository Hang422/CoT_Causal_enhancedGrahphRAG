Produced by alpha cells of pancreas\nopb. Two polypeptide chains are bound by disulfide linkages\nopc. Shifts potassium outside the cell\nopd. S.c insulin tl/2 is 60 mins\n\n### Reasoning Chains for Validation:\n- CHAIN: \"Insulin\" -> \"produced by beta cells of pancreas\" -> \"not alpha cells\" -> 0%\n- CHAIN: s\" -> \"bound by disulfide linkages\" -> 95%\n- CHAIN: \"Insulin\" -> \"shifts potassium into cells\" -> \"not outside\" -> 0%\n- CHAIN: \"Subcutaneous insulin\" -> \"half-life\" -> \"approximately 5-10 minutes\" -> \"not 60 minutes\" -> 0%\n\n### Retrieved Validation Paths:\n- (Insulin)-CAUSES->(Energy Metabolism)-PROCESS_OF->(Pancreas)\n- (Insulin)-CAUSES->(physiological aspects)-PROCESS_OF->(Pancreas)\n\n            ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3.

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Insulin is a hormone produced by the beta cells of the pancreas, not the alpha cells, which produce glucagon. Therefore, option opa is incorrect. Insulin consists of two polypeptide chains, A and B, which are connected by disulfide bonds, making option opb correct. Insulin facilitates the uptake of glucose and potassium into cells, not the shift of potassium outside the cell, so option opc is incorrect. The half-life of subcutaneous insulin is not 60 minutes; it is typically much shorter, around 5-10 minutes, making option opd incorrect. Based on these analyses, the most accurate statement is that insulin's two polypeptide chains are bound by disulfide linkages.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
