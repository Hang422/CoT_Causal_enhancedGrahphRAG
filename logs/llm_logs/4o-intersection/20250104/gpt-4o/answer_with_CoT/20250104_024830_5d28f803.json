Chlorpropamide\nopb. Glibenclamide\nopc. Glicazide\nopd. Glipizide\n\n### Reasoning Chains for Validation:\n- CHAIN: \"Chlorpropamide\" -> \"sulfonylurea class\" -> \"stimulates insulin release\" -> \"treats type 2 diabetes mellitus\" -> \"antidiuretic effect\" -> \"treats diabetes insipidus\" -> 85%\n- CHAIN: \"Glibenclamide\" -> \"sulfonylurea class\" -> \"stimulates insulin release\" -> \"treats type 2 diabetes mellitus\" -> \"no known effect on diabetes insipidus\" -> 40%\n- CHAIN: \"Glicazide\" -> \"sulfonylurea class\" -> \"stimulates insulin release\" -> \"treats type 2 diabetes mellitus\" -> \"no known effect on diabetes insipidus\" -> 40%\n- CHAIN: \"Glipizide\" -> \"sulfonylurea class\" -> \"stimulates insulin release\" -> \"treats type 2 diabetes mellitus\" -> \"no known effect on diabetes insipidus\" -> 40%\n\n### Retrieved Validation Paths:\n- (Insulin)-CAUSES->(Diabetes Mellitus, Non-Insulin-Dependent)-Insulin\n\n            ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n                \n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n            "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Chlorpropamide is a drug from the sulfonylurea class, primarily used to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus by stimulating insulin release. It is unique among sulfonylureas because it also has an antidiuretic effect, which can be beneficial in treating diabetes insipidus. This dual action is not shared by other sulfonylureas like Glibenclamide, Glicazide, or Glipizide, which are used solely for diabetes mellitus and have no known effect on diabetes insipidus. Therefore, based on standard medical knowledge, Chlorpropamide is the only drug among the options that is used to treat both diabetes mellitus and diabetes insipidus.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
