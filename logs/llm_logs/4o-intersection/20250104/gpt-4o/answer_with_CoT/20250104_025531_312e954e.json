  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Pneumonia caused by P. carinii, now known as Pneumocystis jirovecii, is an opportunistic infection commonly seen in immunocompromised patients, such as those with HIV/AIDS. The standard treatment for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) is Cotrimoxazole, also known as Trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole. This combination is effective against P. jirovecii and is recommended both for treatment and prophylaxis in high-risk patients. Penicillin is ineffective as it targets bacterial infections, whereas P. jirovecii is a fungus. Kanamycin and Levofloxacin are not effective against P. jirovecii, with Levofloxacin being a fluoroquinolone antibiotic used for bacterial infections. Therefore, based on medical consensus, Cotrimoxazole is the drug of choice for pneumonia caused by P. carinii.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
