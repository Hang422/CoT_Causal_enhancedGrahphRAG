Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3.

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The child's symptoms of aggressive and self-mutilating behavior, poor concentration, joint pain, and reduced urinary output are indicative of a neurological and metabolic disorder. These symptoms align with Lesch-Nyhan syndrome, which is characterized by self-mutilation, neurological symptoms, and gout-like symptoms due to hyperuricemia. Lesch-Nyhan syndrome is caused by a deficiency in the enzyme hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRT). This enzyme deficiency leads to the overproduction of uric acid, causing joint pain and reduced urinary output. The consensus in medical literature supports HGPRT deficiency as the cause of these symptoms.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
