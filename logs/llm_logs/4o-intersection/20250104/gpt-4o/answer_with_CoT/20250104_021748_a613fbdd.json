  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"To determine which enzyme is not a marker of the plasma membrane, we need to consider the typical localization and function of each enzyme. 5'-nucleotidase is known to be associated with the plasma membrane, where it plays a role in nucleotide metabolism. Adenylyl cyclase is an enzyme that is also associated with the plasma membrane, involved in the conversion of ATP to cyclic AMP, a crucial signaling molecule. Na+-K+-ATPase is a well-known plasma membrane enzyme responsible for maintaining the electrochemical gradient across the cell membrane. Galactosyl transferase, however, is primarily localized in the Golgi apparatus, where it is involved in glycosylation processes. Therefore, it is not typically considered a marker for the plasma membrane. Based on this analysis, galactosyl transferase is the enzyme that does not fit as a plasma membrane marker.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
