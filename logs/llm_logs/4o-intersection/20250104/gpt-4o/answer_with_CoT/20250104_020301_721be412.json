Sparfloxacin\nopb. Tetracycline\nopc. Gentamicin\nopd. Clofazimine\n\n### Reasoning Chains for Validation:\n- CHAIN: \"Tetracycline\" -> \"increased intracranial pressure\" -> \"Pseudotumour cerebri\" -> 95%\n- CHAIN: \"Sparfloxacin\" -> \"antibiotic effect\" -> \"no known link to Pseudotumour cerebri\" -> 20%\n- CHAIN: \"Gentamicin\" -> \"ototoxicity\" -> \"no known link to Pseudotumour cerebri\" -> 10%\n- CHAIN: \"Clofazimine\" -> \"skin discoloration\" -> \"no known link to Pseudotumour cerebri\" -> 15%\n\n### Retrieved Validation Paths:\n- (Clofazimine)-TREATS->(Disease)-CAUSES->(Discoloration of skin)\n\n            ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n                \n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n            "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Pseudotumor cerebri, also known as idiopathic intracranial hypertension, is a condition characterized by increased intracranial pressure without an obvious cause. Certain medications are known to be associated with this condition, and tetracycline is one of them. Tetracycline and related antibiotics have been documented to cause increased intracranial pressure, leading to pseudotumor cerebri. The other options, including sparfloxacin, gentamicin, and clofazimine, do not have a known association with pseudotumor cerebri. Therefore, based on standard medical knowledge and consensus, tetracycline is the most likely drug to cause pseudotumor cerebri.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
