  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The question asks for a topical immunomodulator used in the treatment of genital warts. Imiquimod is a topical agent that works by modulating the immune response, specifically enhancing the body's immune system to fight against the human papillomavirus (HPV), which causes genital warts. This aligns with the primary mechanism of action for imiquimod, making it the most appropriate choice. Podophylline is also used for genital warts but acts as a cytotoxic agent rather than an immunomodulator. Interferon can modulate the immune response but is not typically used topically for genital warts. Acyclovir is an antiviral used for herpes simplex virus, not for genital warts. Therefore, based on the mechanism of action and typical use, imiquimod is the best-supported option.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
