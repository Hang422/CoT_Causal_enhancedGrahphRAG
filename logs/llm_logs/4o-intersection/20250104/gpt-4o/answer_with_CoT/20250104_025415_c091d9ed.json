Glucocoicoids\nopb. Mineralcoicoids\nopc. Aldosterone\nopd. Androgens\n\n### Reasoning Chains for Validation:\n- CHAIN: \"Zona reticularis\" -> \"produces androgens\" -> \"major hormone secreted\" -> \"androgens\" -> 95%\n- CHAIN: \"Zona reticularis\" -> \"produces some glucocorticoids\" -> \"possible minor secretion\" -> \"glucocorticoids\" -> 60%\n- CHAIN: \"Zona reticularis\" -> \"does not primarily produce mineralocorticoids\" -> \"unlikely major hormone\" -> \"mineralocorticoids\" -> 20%\n- CHAIN: \"Zona reticularis\" -> \"does not produce aldosterone\" -> \"aldosterone not secreted\" -> \"aldosterone\" -> 10%\n\n### Retrieved Validation Paths:\n- (Zona Reticularis)-LOCATION_OF->(Androgens)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Glucocorticoids)\n- (Zona Reticularis)-LOCATION_OF->(Lipids)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Aldosterone)\n- (Zona Reticularis)-PART_OF->(Brain)-LOCATION_OF->(Aldosterone)\n- (Zona Reticularis)-LOCATION_OF->(Androgens)\n- (Zona Reticularis)-LOCATION_OF->(Corticosterone)-INTERACTS_WITH/ISA->(Mineralocorticoids)\n- (Androgens)-INTERACTS_WITH/ISA->(Hormones)\n\n            ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n                \n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n            "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The adrenal cortex is divided into three zones: zona glomerulosa, zona fasciculata, and zona reticularis. Each zone is responsible for producing different types of hormones. The zona reticularis is primarily responsible for the production of androgens, which are a group of hormones that play a role in male traits and reproductive activity. While the zona reticularis can produce some glucocorticoids, its main function is the secretion of androgens. Mineralocorticoids and aldosterone are primarily produced by the zona glomerulosa, not the zona reticularis. Therefore, based on standard medical knowledge, the major hormone secreted by the zona reticularis is androgens.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
