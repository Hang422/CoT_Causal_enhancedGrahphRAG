Leucine\nopb. Lysine\nopc. Methionine\nopd. Proline\n\n### Reasoning Chains for Validation:\n- CHAIN: \"Leucine\" -> \"essential amino acid\" -> \"required for protein synthesis\" -> 90%\n- CHAIN: \"Lysine\" -> \"essential amino acid\" -> \"important for growth and tissue repair\" -> 90%\n- CHAIN: \"Methionine\" -> \"essential amino acid\" -> \"involved in methylation processes\" -> 90%\n- CHAIN: \"Proline\" -> \"non-essential amino acid\" -> \"synthesized by the body\" -> 95%\n\n### Retrieved Validation Paths:\n- (Leucine)-INTERACTS_WITH->(T-Lymphocyte)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Amino Acids)\n- (Leucine)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cells)-LOCATION_OF->(Amino Acids)\n- (Lysine)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cells)-INTERACTS_WITH/LOCATION_OF->(Amino Acids)\n\n            ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n                \n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n            "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Essential amino acids are those that cannot be synthesized by the human body and must be obtained through diet. Leucine, lysine, and methionine are all well-established essential amino acids, as they play critical roles in protein synthesis, growth, tissue repair, and metabolic processes. Proline, on the other hand, is classified as a non-essential amino acid because the body can synthesize it from other compounds. Therefore, based on standard medical knowledge, proline is the amino acid that is not essential.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
