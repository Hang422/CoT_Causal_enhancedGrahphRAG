  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Wernicke's encephalopathy is a neurological disorder characterized by symptoms such as confusion, ataxia, and ocular abnormalities. It is primarily caused by a deficiency in thiamine, also known as vitamin B1. This condition is often associated with chronic alcoholism, which can lead to malnutrition and subsequently thiamine deficiency. The consensus in medical literature strongly supports thiamine (vitamin B1) deficiency as the major cause of Wernicke's encephalopathy. Other vitamins listed, such as B2, B6, and B12, are not primarily associated with this condition. Therefore, the most likely correct answer is vitamin B1.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
