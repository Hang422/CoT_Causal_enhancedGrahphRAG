None of the above\nopb. Albumin\nopc. Globulins\nopd. Chylomicrons\n\n### Reasoning Chains for Validation:\n- CHAIN: \"Free fatty acids\" -> \"bound to albumin in blood\" -> \"transported to cells\" -> \"enter mitochondria for oxidation\" -> 90%\n- CHAIN: \"Free fatty acids\" -> \"not transported by globulins\" -> \"globulins primarily transport hormones and vitamins\" -> 10%\n- CHAIN: \"Free fatty acids\" -> \"not transported by chylomicrons\" -> \"chylomicrons transport dietary lipids from intestines\" -> 10%\n- CHAIN: \"Free fatty acids\" -> \"not transported by none of the above\" -> \"require a carrier in blood\" -> 5%\n\n### Retrieved Validation Paths:\n- (Fatty Acids, Nonesterified)-PART_OF->(Cells)-LOCATION_OF->(Albumins)\n- (Fatty Acids, Nonesterified)-PREDISPOSES->(Diastasis)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Albumins)\n- (Fatty Acids, Nonesterified)-PREDISPOSES->(Diastasis)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Globulins)\n- (Fatty Acids, Nonesterified)-PART_OF->(Lymphocyte)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Globulins)\n- (Fatty Acids, Nonesterified)-PREDISPOSES->(Diastasis)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Chylomicrons)\n- (Fatty Acids, Nonesterified)-PART_OF->(Adipocytes)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Chylomicrons)\n- (Globulins)-INTERACTS_WITH->(T-Lymphocyte)-LOCATION_OF->(Genes)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Vitamins)\n- (Globulins)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cells)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Genes)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Vitamins)\n\n            ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3.

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Free fatty acids in the bloodstream are primarily bound to albumin for transport. Albumin is a protein that acts as a carrier for free fatty acids, allowing them to be transported to various tissues, including muscle and liver, where they can enter the mitochondria for oxidation. Globulins and chylomicrons do not serve this function. Globulins are more involved in transporting hormones and vitamins, while chylomicrons are responsible for transporting dietary lipids from the intestines. Therefore, the most likely correct option is that free fatty acids are transported by albumin.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
