Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3.

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Aldosterone is a hormone that primarily acts on the distal tubules and the collecting ducts of the nephron in the kidney. Its main function is to increase sodium reabsorption and potassium excretion, which leads to water retention and increased blood volume. While there is some sodium reabsorption in the proximal tubule and loop of Henle, aldosterone's action is most significant in the distal tubules and collecting ducts. The strongest consensus in medical literature is that aldosterone acts on the collecting duct, where it enhances sodium reabsorption and potassium excretion. Therefore, the most likely correct answer is that aldosterone acts on the collecting duct.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
