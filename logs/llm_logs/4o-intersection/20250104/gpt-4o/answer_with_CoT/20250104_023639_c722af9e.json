All of the following are true about heparin except-\n\n            ### Options\n            opa. Weakest acid found in living things\nopb. Most commercial preparations of heparin now utilize pig intestinal slimes\nopc. Act via Antithrombin activation\nopd. Produce thrombocytopenia\n\n### Reasoning Chains for Validation:\n- CHAIN: \"Heparin\" -> \"anticoagulant\" -> \"acts via Antithrombin activation\" -> 95%\n- CHAIN: \"Heparin\" -> \"commercial preparations\" -> \"utilize pig intestinal slimes\" -> 90%\n- CHAIN: \"Heparin\" -> \"side effect\" -> \"produce thrombocytopenia\" -> 85%\n- CHAIN: \"Heparin\" -> \"weakest acid\" -> \"found in living things\" -> \"possible misconception\" -> 60%\n\n### Retrieved Validation Paths:\n- (Heparin)-INTERACTS_WITH/ISA->(Anticoagulants)\n\n            ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3.

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Heparin is a well-known anticoagulant that primarily acts by activating Antithrombin, which inhibits thrombin and factor Xa, thus preventing clot formation. This mechanism of action is well-documented and widely accepted in medical literature, supporting option opc as true. Most commercial preparations of heparin are derived from pig intestinal mucosa, which aligns with option opb. Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is a recognized side effect, making option opd true. The statement that heparin is the 'weakest acid found in living things' is not a recognized or relevant characteristic of heparin. This appears to be a misconception or misstatement, as heparin is not typically described in terms of its acidity in biological contexts. Therefore, the statement in option opa is the exception and is not true about heparin.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
