  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The primary role of lipoproteins is to transport lipids, including cholesterol, throughout the body. Cholesterol synthesized in the liver is initially packaged into VLDL (Very Low-Density Lipoproteins). VLDL primarily transports triglycerides to peripheral tissues. As VLDL loses triglycerides, it is converted into LDL (Low-Density Lipoproteins) in the bloodstream. LDL is the main lipoprotein responsible for delivering cholesterol to peripheral tissues. HDL (High-Density Lipoproteins) is mainly involved in reverse cholesterol transport, carrying cholesterol away from tissues back to the liver, not to peripheral tissues. Chylomicrons are primarily involved in transporting dietary lipids from the intestines, not from the liver to peripheral tissues. Therefore, based on standard medical knowledge, LDL is the primary transporter of cholesterol from the liver to peripheral tissues.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
