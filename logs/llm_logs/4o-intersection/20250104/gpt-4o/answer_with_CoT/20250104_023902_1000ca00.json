Stagnant hypoxia\nopb. Anemic hypoxia\nopc. Hypoxic hypoxia\nopd.

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Shock is a condition characterized by inadequate blood flow to tissues, leading to insufficient oxygen delivery. This is primarily due to decreased perfusion, which aligns with stagnant hypoxia, where there is a failure to deliver oxygenated blood effectively to tissues. While anemic hypoxia could occur if shock is due to significant blood loss, stagnant hypoxia is more directly related to the core issue of shock, which is impaired circulation. Hypoxic hypoxia and histotoxic hypoxia are less directly related to the primary mechanisms of shock. Therefore, stagnant hypoxia is the most likely type of hypoxia caused by shock.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
