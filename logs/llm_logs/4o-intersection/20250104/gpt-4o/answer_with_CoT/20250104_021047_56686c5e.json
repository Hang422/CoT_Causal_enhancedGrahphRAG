It is an enzyme inducer\nopb. It causes obesity\nopc. It causes Hirsutism\nopd. It causes neural tube defects\n\n### Reasoning Chains for Validation:\n- CHAIN: \"Valproic acid\" -> \"enzyme inhibitor\" -> \"not an enzyme inducer\" -> 95%\n- CHAIN: \"Valproic acid\" -> \"weight gain\" -> \"obesity\" -> 85%\n- CHAIN: \"Valproic acid\" -> \"hormonal changes\" -> \"possible hirsutism\" -> 60%\n- CHAIN: \"Valproic acid\" -> \"teratogenic effects\" -> \"neural tube defects\" -> 90%\n\n### Retrieved Validation Paths:\n- (Valproic Acid)-CAUSES->(Teratogenesis)\n\n            ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n                \n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n            "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Valproic acid is primarily known as an enzyme inhibitor, not an inducer, which rules out option opa. It is associated with weight gain, which can lead to obesity, supporting option opb. While hirsutism is not a well-documented side effect of valproic acid, hormonal changes can occur, making option opc less likely but not impossible. Valproic acid is well-known for its teratogenic effects, including neural tube defects, supporting option opd. Therefore, the most likely correct answer is that valproic acid is not an enzyme inducer.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
