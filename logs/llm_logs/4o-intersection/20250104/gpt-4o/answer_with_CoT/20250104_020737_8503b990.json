Can be used in absence seizures\nopb. Can be mixed with saline\nopc. Can be given orally\nopd.

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Fosphenytoin is a water-soluble prodrug of phenytoin, which allows it to be mixed with saline for intravenous or intramuscular administration. This is a key difference from phenytoin, which is not water-soluble and cannot be mixed with saline. Fosphenytoin, like phenytoin, is not effective for absence seizures and is not the drug of choice for myoclonic seizures. Additionally, fosphenytoin is not administered orally, as it is designed for parenteral use. Therefore, the most significant difference between fosphenytoin and phenytoin is that fosphenytoin can be mixed with saline.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
