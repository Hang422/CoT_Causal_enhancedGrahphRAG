Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3.

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Propranolol is a non-selective beta-blocker that is commonly used to manage various cardiovascular conditions and symptoms related to increased sympathetic activity. It is effective in controlling atrial flutter by decreasing heart rate and reducing cardiac workload. In thyrotoxicosis, propranolol helps alleviate symptoms by reducing sympathetic overactivity. In hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM), propranolol can be used to reduce heart rate and improve symptoms, although care must be taken due to its potential to worsen outflow obstruction in some cases. However, propranolol is not typically used for Parkinsonian tremor. While beta-blockers can reduce certain types of tremors, Parkinsonian tremor is primarily managed with medications that address dopaminergic pathways, such as levodopa or dopamine agonists. Therefore, propranolol is not considered useful for Parkinsonian tremor.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}\n```",
