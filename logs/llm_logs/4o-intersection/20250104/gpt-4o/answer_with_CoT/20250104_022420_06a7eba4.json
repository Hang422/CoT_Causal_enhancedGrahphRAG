  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The fluidity of the plasma membrane is influenced by the types of fatty acids present. Unsaturated fatty acids, such as arachidonic acid, have kinks in their structure due to double bonds, which prevent tight packing of the lipid molecules, thereby increasing membrane fluidity. In contrast, saturated fatty acids like palmitic acid and stearic acid have no double bonds, allowing them to pack closely together, which decreases membrane fluidity. Cholesterol has a complex role; it can both increase and decrease fluidity depending on the temperature and the specific lipid environment, but generally, it is known to stabilize the membrane and decrease fluidity at physiological temperatures. Therefore, the most likely correct answer is that arachidonic acid increases membrane fluidity due to its unsaturated nature.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
