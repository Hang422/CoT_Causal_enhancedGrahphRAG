  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"In the context of cardiac failure, the choice of diuretic is crucial. Mannitol is an osmotic diuretic that works by increasing the osmotic pressure of the glomerular filtrate, leading to increased excretion of water and electrolytes. However, it also increases plasma volume, which can exacerbate cardiac failure by increasing the workload on the heart. This makes it contraindicated in patients with cardiac failure. On the other hand, spironolactone, furosemide, and hydrochlorothiazide are used to reduce fluid overload and are generally beneficial in managing cardiac failure. Spironolactone is a potassium-sparing diuretic that helps in reducing fluid overload and is often used in heart failure. Furosemide is a loop diuretic that is effective in reducing fluid overload in heart failure. Hydrochlorothiazide is a thiazide diuretic that can be used in mild cases of heart failure. Therefore, based on the mechanism of action and effects on cardiac function, mannitol is the diuretic that is contraindicated in the presence of cardiac failure.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
