  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"To determine which drug is not associated with depression as a side effect, we analyze each option. Propranolol, a beta-blocker, is known to have central nervous system effects, including the potential to cause depression in some individuals. Oral contraceptives can lead to mood changes due to hormonal alterations, which may include depression. Reserpine is well-documented to cause depression due to its mechanism of depleting monoamines, including serotonin. Flupenthixol, an antipsychotic, is primarily used to treat schizophrenia and depression, and is not typically associated with causing depression. Therefore, based on standard medical knowledge, Flupenthixol is the most likely option not associated with depression as a side effect.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
