Pylori:\n\n            ### Options\n            opa. Metronidazole\nopb. Erythromycin\nopc. Ciprofloxacin\nopd. Aminoglycosides\n\n### Reasoning Chains for Validation:\n- CHAIN: \"Metronidazole\" -> \"antibacterial action\" -> \"eradication of H. pylori\" -> \"component of triple therapy\" -> 95%\n- CHAIN: \"Erythromycin\" -> \"macrolide antibiotic\" -> \"less effective against H. pylori\" -> \"not standard in triple therapy\" -> 40%\n- CHAIN: \"Ciprofloxacin\" -> \"fluoroquinolone antibiotic\" -> \"not typically used in first-line H. pylori therapy\" -> \"alternative in resistant cases\" -> 50%\n- CHAIN: \"Aminoglycosides\" -> \"broad-spectrum antibiotic\" -> \"not effective against H. pylori\" -> \"not used in triple therapy\" -> 30%\n\n### Retrieved Validation Paths:\n- (Ciprofloxacin)-TREATS->(Staphylococcus aureus)-LOCATION_OF->(Microbicides)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Fluoroquinolones)\n\n            ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n                \n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n            "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The standard triple therapy for H. pylori infection typically includes a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) and two antibiotics. Metronidazole is commonly used in combination with clarithromycin or amoxicillin as part of this regimen. Erythromycin is a macrolide antibiotic but is not typically used in H. pylori treatment due to its lower efficacy compared to clarithromycin. Ciprofloxacin, a fluoroquinolone, is not part of the first-line triple therapy but may be used in cases of resistance or treatment failure. Aminoglycosides are not effective against H. pylori and are not used in its treatment. Based on standard medical practice, Metronidazole is the most likely correct option for inclusion in triple therapy for H. pylori.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
