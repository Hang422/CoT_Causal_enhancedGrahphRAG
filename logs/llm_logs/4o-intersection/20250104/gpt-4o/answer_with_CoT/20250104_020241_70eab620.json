  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Fibrinolytic drugs, such as tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), are used to dissolve blood clots in the treatment of acute myocardial infarction. The primary mechanism involves the conversion of plasminogen to plasmin, which then degrades fibrin clots. While effective in restoring blood flow, this systemic activation of fibrinolysis increases the risk of bleeding complications. Among these, hemorrhagic stroke is a well-documented and serious adverse effect due to the potential for bleeding in the brain. Other options, such as acute renal failure, development of antiplatelet antibodies, and encephalitis secondary to liver dysfunction, are not commonly associated with fibrinolytic therapy. Therefore, based on the mechanism of action and known adverse effects, hemorrhagic stroke is the most likely complication.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
