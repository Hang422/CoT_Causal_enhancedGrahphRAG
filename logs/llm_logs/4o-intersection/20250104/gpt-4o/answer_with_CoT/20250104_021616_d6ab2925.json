Methimazole\nopb. Propylthiouraril\nopc. Carbimazole\nopd. Perchlorate\n\n### Reasoning Chains for Validation:\n- CHAIN: \"Methimazole\" -> \"crosses placenta\" -> \"risk of fetal abnormalities\" -> \"not preferred in first trimester\" -> 70%\n- CHAIN: \"Propylthiouracil\" -> \"less placental transfer\" -> \"lower risk of fetal abnormalities\" -> \"preferred in first trimester\" -> 90%\n- CHAIN: \"Carbimazole\" -> \"metabolized to methimazole\" -> \"similar risks as methimazole\" -> \"not preferred in first trimester\" -> 70%\n- CHAIN: \"Perchlorate\" -> \"less commonly used\" -> \"potential for fetal harm\" -> \"not preferred in pregnancy\" -> 60%\n\n### Retrieved Validation Paths:\n- (Carbimazole)-TREATS->(Disease)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Virus)-LOCATION_OF->(Enzymes)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Methimazole)\n\n            ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3.

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"In the management of hyperthyroidism during the first trimester of pregnancy, the primary concern is minimizing the risk of fetal abnormalities. Methimazole and its prodrug carbimazole are associated with a higher risk of congenital malformations when used in the first trimester. Propylthiouracil (PTU) is preferred because it has less placental transfer and a lower risk of causing fetal abnormalities compared to methimazole. Perchlorate is not commonly used due to potential fetal harm and is not recommended during pregnancy. Therefore, based on standard medical guidelines and consensus, Propylthiouracil is the drug of choice for treating hyperthyroidism in the first trimester of pregnancy.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}\n```",
