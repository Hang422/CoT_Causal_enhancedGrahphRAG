Retinol\nopb. Retinal\nopc. Retinoic acids\nopd. All of the above\n\n### Reasoning Chains for Validation:\n- CHAIN: \"Vitamin A\" -> \"converted to Retinol\" -> \"supports vision and immune function\" -> 85%\n- CHAIN: \"Vitamin A\" -> \"converted to Retinal\" -> \"essential for vision\" -> 85%\n- CHAIN: \"Vitamin A\" -> \"converted to Retinoic acids\" -> \"regulates gene expression\" -> 85%\n- CHAIN: \"Vitamin A\" -> \"Retinol\" -> \"Retinal\" -> \"Retinoic acids\" -> \"all related functions\" -> 95%\n\n### Retrieved Validation Paths:\n- (Vitamin A)-CAUSES->(Disease)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(paracrine)-PROCESS_OF->(Retina)\n- (Vitamin A)-CAUSES->(Disease)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(uptake)-PROCESS_OF->(Retina)\n- (Vitamin A)-CAUSES->(Disease)-CAUSES->(arterial stiffness)-PROCESS_OF->(Retina)\n- (Vitamin A)-PART_OF->(Cells)-LOCATION_OF->(Retinoids)\n\n            ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3.

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Vitamin A is a group of compounds that includes retinol, retinal, and retinoic acids. Each of these forms has distinct but related functions in the body. Retinol is involved in vision and immune function, retinal is crucial for vision, particularly in the conversion of light into signals in the retina, and retinoic acids are important for regulating gene expression and cellular differentiation. Given that all these forms are related to the functions of vitamin A, the most comprehensive and correct answer is that vitamin A's functions are related to all of the above forms.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
