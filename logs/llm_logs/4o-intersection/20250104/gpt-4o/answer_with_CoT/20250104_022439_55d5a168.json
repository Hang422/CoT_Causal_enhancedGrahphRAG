Spectrin\nopb. Ankyrin\nopc. Tubulin\nopd. Laminin\n\n### Reasoning Chains for Validation:\n- CHAIN: \"Spectrin\" -> \"cytoskeletal protein\" -> \"binds to plasma membrane\" -> \"stabilizes cell shape\" -> 85%\n- CHAIN: \"Ankyrin\" -> \"anchors spectrin to plasma membrane\" -> \"connects cytoskeleton to membrane proteins\" -> 90%\n- CHAIN: \"Tubulin\" -> \"microtubule component\" -> \"not directly binding plasma membrane\" -> \"possible indirect role\" -> 60%\n- CHAIN: \"Laminin\" -> \"extracellular matrix protein\" -> \"not directly involved in cytoskeleton binding\" -> \"unclear role in plasma membrane binding\" -> 50%\n\n### Retrieved Validation Paths:\n- (Cell membrane)-PART_OF->(Cells)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Membrane Proteins)\n- (Cell membrane)-PART_OF->(Erythroblasts)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Membrane Proteins)\n- (Spectrin)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cells)-INTERACTS_WITH/LOCATION_OF->(Cytoskeletal Proteins)\n- (Spectrin)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cells)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Membrane Proteins)\n- (Laminin)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cells)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Extracellular Matrix Proteins)\n- (Ankyrins)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cells)-PART_OF->(Bone Marrow)-LOCATION_OF->(Anchoring)\n- (Cytoskeletal Proteins)-PART_OF->(apical membrane)-PART_OF->(Cell membrane)\n\n            ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3.

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The question involves understanding the interaction between the plasma membrane and the cytoskeleton. Spectrin is a cytoskeletal protein that plays a crucial role in maintaining cell shape by forming a meshwork beneath the plasma membrane. Ankyrin is a protein that anchors spectrin to the plasma membrane, effectively linking the cytoskeleton to membrane proteins. Tubulin is a component of microtubules and does not directly bind to the plasma membrane, while laminin is part of the extracellular matrix and not directly involved in cytoskeleton binding to the plasma membrane. Given this information, ankyrin is the most likely correct answer as it directly facilitates the connection between the cytoskeleton and the plasma membrane.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}\n```",
