  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Sertoli cells are known to secrete androgen-binding protein (ABP), which plays a crucial role in maintaining high concentrations of testosterone in the seminiferous tubules, essential for spermatogenesis. This aligns with the first reasoning chain, which is supported by standard medical knowledge. Sertoli cells do not secrete testosterone, LH, or FSH. Testosterone is produced by Leydig cells, LH stimulates Leydig cells to produce testosterone, and FSH acts on Sertoli cells to support spermatogenesis. Therefore, the most likely correct answer is that Sertoli cells secrete androgen-binding protein.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
