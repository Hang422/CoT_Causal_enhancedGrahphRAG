Streptomycin\nopb. Ethambutol\nopc. Capreomycin\nopd. Rifampicin\n\n### Reasoning Chains for Validation:\n- CHAIN: \"Streptomycin\" -> \"aminoglycoside antibiotic\" -> \"excreted by kidneys\" -> \"accumulates in renal failure\" -> \"not safe in severe renal failure\" -> 20%\n- CHAIN: \"Ethambutol\" -> \"excreted by kidneys\" -> \"accumulates in renal failure\" -> \"dose adjustment needed\" -> \"not safe without adjustment\" -> 30%\n- CHAIN: \"Capreomycin\" -> \"aminoglycoside-like antibiotic\" -> \"excreted by kidneys\" -> \"accumulates in renal failure\" -> \"not safe in severe renal failure\" -> 20%\n- CHAIN: \"Rifampicin\" -> \"metabolized by liver\" -> \"minimal renal excretion\" -> \"safe in severe renal failure\" -> 90%\n\n### Retrieved Validation Paths:\n- (Streptomycin)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Disease)-PROCESS_OF->(Actinobacteria class)-LOCATION_OF->(Antibiotics, Aminoglycoside)\n- (Streptomycin)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Disease)-PROCESS_OF->(Salmonella typhimurium)-LOCATION_OF->(Antibiotics, Aminoglycoside)\n- (Ethambutol)-TREATS->(Epilepsy)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(voltage gated channel)-PROCESS_OF->(Kidney)\n- (Ethambutol)-TREATS->(Disease)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(paracrine)-PROCESS_OF->(Kidney)\n\n            ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3.

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"In determining which antitubercular drug can be safely used in severe renal failure, we must consider the primary route of excretion for each drug. Streptomycin and Capreomycin are both aminoglycoside or aminoglycoside-like antibiotics, which are primarily excreted by the kidneys. This makes them unsafe in severe renal failure due to the risk of accumulation and toxicity. Ethambutol is also primarily excreted by the kidneys, requiring dose adjustment in renal impairment, and is not considered safe without such adjustments. Rifampicin, on the other hand, is primarily metabolized by the liver and has minimal renal excretion, making it the safest option among the listed drugs for use in severe renal failure. Therefore, based on standard medical knowledge and consensus, Rifampicin is the most appropriate choice.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}\n```",
