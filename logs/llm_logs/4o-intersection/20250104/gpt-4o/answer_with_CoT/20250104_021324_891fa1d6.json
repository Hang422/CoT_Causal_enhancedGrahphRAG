Morphine\nopb. Dextromethorphan\nopc. Diphenhydramine\nopd.

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Dextromethorphan is known to act as an NMDA receptor antagonist, which can lead to altered neurotransmission and is associated with hallucinations, especially at high doses. This is a well-documented effect and aligns with the consensus in medical literature. Morphine, while an opioid, can cause hallucinations, but this is less common and typically associated with higher doses or in sensitive individuals. Diphenhydramine, an antihistamine with anticholinergic properties, can cause central nervous system effects including hallucinations, but this is also less common and usually occurs at high doses. Aprepitant, primarily used as an antiemetic, does not have a strong association with hallucinations. Therefore, based on the mechanism of action and documented effects, dextromethorphan is the most likely antitussive to cause hallucinations.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
