  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Secretin is a hormone primarily involved in the regulation of the digestive system. Its most well-known and significant action is to stimulate the pancreas to secrete bicarbonate-rich fluid. This bicarbonate helps to neutralize the acidic chyme that enters the small intestine from the stomach. While secretin does have other effects, such as mildly inhibiting gastric acid secretion and possibly affecting the pyloric sphincter, the primary and most important action is the stimulation of bicarbonate secretion by the pancreas. This aligns with the consensus in medical physiology, where secretin's role in increasing pancreatic bicarbonate secretion is emphasized as its key function.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
