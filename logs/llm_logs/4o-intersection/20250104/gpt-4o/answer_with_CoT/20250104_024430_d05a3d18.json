Leydig cells\nopb. Seolie cells\nopc. Seminiferous tubules\nopd. Epididymis\n\n### Reasoning Chains for Validation:\n- CHAIN: \"Leydig cells\" -> \"testosterone production\" -> \"primary source\" -> 95%\n- CHAIN: \"Seolie cells\" -> \"possible misinterpretation\" -> \"not known for testosterone production\" -> 10%\n- CHAIN: \"Seminiferous tubules\" -> \"sperm production\" -> \"not primary testosterone source\" -> 20%\n- CHAIN: \"Epididymis\" -> \"sperm maturation\" -> \"not involved in testosterone production\" -> 5%\n\n### Retrieved Validation Paths:\n- (Structure of interstitial cell of Leydig)-LOCATION_OF->(Testosterone)\n- (sperm cell)-PART_OF->(Column)-LOCATION_OF->(Testosterone)\n- (sperm cell)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cells)-LOCATION_OF->(Testosterone)\n- (Seminiferous tubule structure)-LOCATION_OF->(Lipids)-PART_OF->(sperm cell)\n\n            ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3.

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Testosterone is primarily produced by the Leydig cells, which are located in the interstitial tissue of the testes. These cells are responsible for the synthesis and secretion of testosterone, a key male sex hormone. The other options do not primarily contribute to testosterone production: 'Seolie cells' seems to be a misinterpretation or misspelling, likely intended to refer to Sertoli cells, which support sperm development but do not produce testosterone. The seminiferous tubules are involved in sperm production, and the epididymis is involved in sperm maturation, neither of which are primary sources of testosterone. Therefore, based on standard medical knowledge, Leydig cells are the main contributors to testosterone production.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
