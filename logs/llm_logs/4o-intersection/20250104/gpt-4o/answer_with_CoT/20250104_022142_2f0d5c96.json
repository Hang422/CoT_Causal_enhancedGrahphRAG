Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3.

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Opioids are well-known for their ability to suppress cough, induce miosis (pupil constriction), and cause truncal rigidity (muscle stiffness). These are common pharmacological actions associated with opioid use. However, anti-emesis (preventing vomiting) is not typically a pharmacological action of opioids. In fact, opioids are more commonly associated with causing nausea and vomiting as a side effect rather than preventing it. Therefore, the action of anti-emesis is not aligned with the typical pharmacological profile of opioids.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
