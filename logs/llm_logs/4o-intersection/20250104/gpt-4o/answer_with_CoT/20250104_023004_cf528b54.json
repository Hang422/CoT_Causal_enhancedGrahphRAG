  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Diabetes insipidus is characterized by a deficiency in antidiuretic hormone (ADH) or a lack of response to it, leading to an inability to concentrate urine. This results in the production of large volumes of dilute urine. The osmolality of urine in diabetes insipidus is typically low because the kidneys cannot reabsorb water effectively, leading to a dilute urine output. The most common range for urine osmolality in diabetes insipidus is less than 300 mmol/L, as this reflects the inability to concentrate urine. While urine osmolality can be very low, often less than 150 mmol/L, the most widely accepted threshold for diagnosing diabetes insipidus is less than 300 mmol/L. Therefore, the best-supported option is opb (<300 mmol/L).\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
