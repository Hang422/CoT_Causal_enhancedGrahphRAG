  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The question asks for a drug that blocks both basal and stimulated gastric acid secretion without affecting cholinergic, histaminergic, or gastrin receptors. Omeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) that directly inhibits the H+/K+ ATPase enzyme in the gastric parietal cells, which is the final step in the acid secretion pathway. This mechanism does not involve cholinergic, histaminergic, or gastrin receptors, making it the most suitable choice. Loxatidine and Famotidine are H2 receptor antagonists, which specifically block histamine receptors, and Pirenzepine is an anticholinergic agent, which affects cholinergic receptors. Therefore, Omeprazole is the only option that fits the criteria of blocking acid secretion without affecting the specified receptors.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opc\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
