  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Aldosterone is a hormone that primarily acts on the distal parts of the nephron, specifically the collecting duct. It promotes sodium reabsorption and potassium excretion, which are key functions of the collecting duct. The glomerulus is involved in filtration, not reabsorption, and the proximal convoluted tubule and loop of Henle are not the primary sites of aldosterone action. The consensus in medical physiology is that aldosterone's main site of action is the collecting duct, where it increases the number of sodium channels and enhances sodium reabsorption, leading to water retention and potassium excretion.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}\n```",
