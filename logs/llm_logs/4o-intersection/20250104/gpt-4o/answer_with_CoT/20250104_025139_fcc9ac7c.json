Fatty acids\nopb. Ketone bodies\nopc. Glucose\nopd. Any of the above\n\n### Reasoning Chains for Validation:\n- CHAIN: \"Fatty acids\" -> \"beta-oxidation\" -> \"ATP production\" -> \"primary energy source\" -> 95%\n- CHAIN: \"Ketone bodies\" -> \"oxidation\" -> \"ATP production\" -> \"secondary energy source\" -> 70%\n- CHAIN: \"Glucose\" -> \"glycolysis\" -> \"ATP production\" -> \"lesser energy source\" -> 60%\n- CHAIN: \"Any of the above\" -> \"metabolized\" -> \"ATP production\" -> \"energy source\" -> 80%\n\n### Retrieved Validation Paths:\n- (Oxidation)-CAUSES->(Disease)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(uptake)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Adenosine Triphosphate)\n\n            ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3.

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"In normal physiological conditions, cardiac muscle primarily relies on fatty acids as its main source of energy. Fatty acids undergo beta-oxidation, which leads to the production of ATP, making them the primary energy source for the heart. While ketone bodies and glucose can also be used by cardiac muscle, they are secondary to fatty acids under normal conditions. Ketone bodies become more significant during prolonged fasting or in certain metabolic states, and glucose is utilized more during high-intensity activities or in conditions where oxygen is limited. Therefore, based on standard medical knowledge, fatty acids are the primary energy source for cardiac muscle under normal conditions.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
