  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The question asks which drug does not cause hyperprolactinemia. Bromocriptine is a dopamine agonist, which means it stimulates dopamine receptors. Dopamine inhibits prolactin release from the pituitary gland, so bromocriptine actually reduces prolactin levels and is used to treat conditions like hyperprolactinemia. On the other hand, Haloperidol and Chlorpromazine are dopamine antagonists, which block dopamine receptors and can lead to increased prolactin release, causing hyperprolactinemia. Reserpine depletes monoamines, including dopamine, which can also lead to increased prolactin levels. Therefore, Bromocriptine is the drug that does not cause hyperprolactinemia.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
