Strongyloidiasis\nopb. Trichomoniasis\nopc. Schistosomiasis\nopd. Rhinosporidiosis\n\n### Reasoning Chains for Validation:\n- CHAIN: \"Praziquantel\" -> \"antiparasitic action\" -> \"effective against trematodes\" -> \"treatment of Schistosomiasis\" -> 95%\n- CHAIN: \"Praziquantel\" -> \"broad-spectrum antiparasitic\" -> \"not effective against protozoa\" -> \"not used for Trichomoniasis\" -> 70%\n- CHAIN: \"Praziquantel\" -> \"not effective against fungi\" -> \"not used for Rhinosporidiosis\" -> 80%\n- CHAIN: \"Praziquantel\" -> \"not effective against nematodes\" -> \"not used for Strongyloidiasis\" -> 85%\n\n### Retrieved Validation Paths:\n- (Praziquantel)-TREATS->(Disease)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(fungus)\n\n            ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3.

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Praziquantel is a well-known antiparasitic medication primarily used for the treatment of infections caused by trematodes and cestodes. It is particularly effective against schistosomiasis, a disease caused by parasitic worms of the genus Schistosoma. The reasoning chains indicate that Praziquantel is not effective against protozoa, fungi, or nematodes, which rules out its use for Trichomoniasis, Rhinosporidiosis, and Strongyloidiasis. Therefore, the most likely correct option based on standard medical knowledge is that Praziquantel is used for the treatment of Schistosomiasis.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opc\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
