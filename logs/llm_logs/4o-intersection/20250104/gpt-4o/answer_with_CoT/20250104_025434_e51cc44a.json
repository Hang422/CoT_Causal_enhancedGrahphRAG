Tyrosine transaminase\nopb. Tyrosine hydroxylase\nopc. Phenylalanine hydroxylase\nopd. Phenylketonuria hydroxylase\n\n### Reasoning Chains for Validation:\n- CHAIN: \"Phenylalanine\" -> \"phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency\" -> \"accumulation of phenylalanine\" -> \"phenylketonuria\" -> 95%\n- CHAIN: \"Phenylalanine\" -> \"tyrosine hydroxylase\" -> \"dopamine synthesis\" -> \"not directly related to phenylketonuria\" -> 20%\n- CHAIN: \"Phenylalanine\" -> \"tyrosine transaminase\" -> \"tyrosine metabolism\" -> \"not directly related to phenylketonuria\" -> 20%\n- CHAIN: \"Phenylalanine\" -> \"phenylketonuria hydroxylase\" -> \"unclear enzyme\" -> \"not recognized in medical literature\" -> 10%\n\n### Retrieved Validation Paths:\n- (Phenylalanine)-TREATS->(Phenylketonurias)\n- (Phenylketonurias)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Pathogenesis)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Phenylalanine)\n- (Phenylketonurias)-ISA->(Acidemia)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Phenylalanine)\n\n            ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n                \n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n            "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Phenylketonuria (PKU) is a metabolic disorder caused by a deficiency in the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase. This enzyme is responsible for converting phenylalanine to tyrosine. When phenylalanine hydroxylase is deficient, phenylalanine accumulates in the body, leading to the symptoms associated with PKU. The other enzymes listed, such as tyrosine transaminase and tyrosine hydroxylase, are involved in different metabolic pathways and are not directly related to the cause of PKU. 'Phenylketonuria hydroxylase' is not a recognized enzyme in medical literature. Therefore, the most likely correct option is 'opc. Phenylalanine hydroxylase'.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opc\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
