Stomach\nopb. Duodenum\nopc. Ileum\nopd. Duodenum + Jejunum\n\n### Reasoning Chains for Validation:\n- CHAIN: \"Iron\" -> \"absorbed primarily in duodenum\" -> \"major site of iron absorption\" -> 90%\n- CHAIN: \"Iron\" -> \"absorbed in duodenum\" -> \"some absorption in jejunum\" -> \"duodenum + jejunum\" -> 70%\n- CHAIN: \"Iron\" -> \"minimal absorption in stomach\" -> \"not primary site\" -> 20%\n- CHAIN: \"Iron\" -> \"absorbed in duodenum\" -> \"not primarily in ileum\" -> 10%\n\n### Retrieved Validation Paths:\n- (Iron)-CAUSES->(physiological aspects)-PROCESS_OF->(Duodenum)\n- (Iron)-CAUSES->(Excretory function)-PROCESS_OF->(Duodenum)\n- (Iron)-CAUSES->(biological adaptation to stress)-PROCESS_OF->(Duodenum)\n- (Iron)-CAUSES->(Energy Metabolism)-PROCESS_OF->(Stomach)\n- (Iron)-CAUSES->(physiological aspects)-PROCESS_OF->(Stomach)\n\n            ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2.

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Iron absorption primarily occurs in the duodenum, which is the first part of the small intestine. This is well-established in medical literature as the major site for iron absorption due to the presence of specific transporters and the acidic environment that facilitates iron solubility. While some iron absorption can occur in the jejunum, the duodenum is the primary site. The stomach is not a significant site for iron absorption, and the ileum is not primarily involved in this process. Therefore, the most likely correct answer, based on consensus, is that iron is absorbed in the duodenum.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}\n```",
