Abciximab\nopb. Eptifibatide\nopc. Tirofiban\nopd. Prasugrel\n\n### Reasoning Chains for Validation:\n- CHAIN: \"Abciximab\" -> \"Gp2b3A inhibitor\" -> \"correct option\" -> 90%\n- CHAIN: \"Eptifibatide\" -> \"Gp2b3A inhibitor\" -> \"correct option\" -> 90%\n- CHAIN: \"Tirofiban\" -> \"Gp2b3A inhibitor\" -> \"correct option\" -> 90%\n- CHAIN: \"Prasugrel\" -> \"antiplatelet agent\" -> \"not a Gp2b3A inhibitor\" -> \"incorrect option\" -> 95%\n\n### Retrieved Validation Paths:\n- (prasugrel)-TREATS->(Complication)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(P2RY12)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Antiplatelet Agents)\n\n            ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3.

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Gp2b3A inhibitors, also known as glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors, are a class of antiplatelet agents that prevent platelet aggregation by blocking the glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor on platelets. Abciximab, Eptifibatide, and Tirofiban are well-known members of this class. Prasugrel, on the other hand, is an antiplatelet agent that works as a P2Y12 inhibitor, not a Gp2b3A inhibitor. Therefore, Prasugrel is the option that does not belong to the Gp2b3A inhibitor class.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
