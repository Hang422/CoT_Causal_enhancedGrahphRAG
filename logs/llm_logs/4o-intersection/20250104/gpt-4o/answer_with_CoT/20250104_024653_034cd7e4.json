Proprioception\nopb. Vibratory sense\nopc. Heat sensation\nopd. Touch\n\n### Reasoning Chains for Validation:\n- CHAIN: \"Proprioception\" -> \"dorsal column\" -> \"carried\" -> 90%\n- CHAIN: \"Vibratory sense\" -> \"dorsal column\" -> \"carried\" -> 90%\n- CHAIN: \"Heat sensation\" -> \"spinothalamic tract\" -> \"not dorsal column\" -> 95%\n- CHAIN: \"Touch\" -> \"dorsal column\" -> \"carried\" -> 90%\n\n### Retrieved Validation Paths:\n- (Therapeutic tactile stimulation)-CAUSES->(Complication)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(IMPACT gene)-PART_OF->(Dorsal funiculus)\n\n            ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n                \n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n            "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The dorsal column of the spinal cord is primarily responsible for carrying sensory information related to proprioception, vibratory sense, and fine touch. These modalities are transmitted via the dorsal column-medial lemniscal pathway. Heat sensation, on the other hand, is carried by the spinothalamic tract, which is responsible for transmitting pain and temperature sensations. Therefore, heat sensation is not carried in the dorsal column. Based on this understanding, the most likely correct answer is that heat sensation is not carried in the dorsal column.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opc\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
