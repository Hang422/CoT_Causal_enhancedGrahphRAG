Methotrexate\nopb. Doxorubicin\nopc. Cisplatin\nopd. Busulfan\n\n### Reasoning Chains for Validation:\n- CHAIN: \"Methotrexate\" -> \"immunosuppressive therapy\" -> \"potential lung toxicity\" -> \"pulmonary fibrosis\" -> 85%\n- CHAIN: \"Doxorubicin\" -> \"chemotherapy agent\" -> \"cardiotoxicity\" -> \"less common lung toxicity\" -> \"pulmonary fibrosis\" -> 60%\n- CHAIN: \"Cisplatin\" -> \"chemotherapy agent\" -> \"nephrotoxicity\" -> \"ototoxicity\" -> \"less common lung toxicity\" -> \"pulmonary fibrosis\" -> 55%\n- CHAIN: \"Busulfan\" -> \"alkylating agent\" -> \"known lung toxicity\" -> \"pulmonary fibrosis\" -> 95%\n\n### Retrieved Validation Paths:\n- (Busulfan)-TREATS->(Functional disorder)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Melphalan)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Alkylating Agents)\n- (Busulfan)-CAUSES->(Graft acceptance)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Melphalan)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Alkylating Agents)\n- (Methotrexate)-INTERACTS_WITH->(T-Lymphocyte)-PART_OF->(Myocardium)-LOCATION_OF->(Therapeutic immunosuppression)\n- (Methotrexate)-INTERACTS_WITH->(T-Lymphocyte)-PART_OF->(Biopsy sample)-LOCATION_OF->(Therapeutic immunosuppression)\n- (Lung)-LOCATION_OF->(Pulmonary Fibrosis)\n- (Toxic nephropathy)-CAUSES->(Kidney Diseases)-CAUSES->(Ototoxicity)\n- (Alkylating Agents)-CAUSES->(Graft acceptance)-PROCESS_OF->(Lung)\n- (Alkylating Agents)-CAUSES->(uptake)-PROCESS_OF->(Lung)\n\n            ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3.

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Pulmonary fibrosis is a known complication of certain medications, particularly those with lung toxicity. Methotrexate, while having potential lung toxicity, is more commonly associated with hypersensitivity pneumonitis rather than pulmonary fibrosis. Doxorubicin and Cisplatin are primarily known for cardiotoxicity and nephrotoxicity/ototoxicity, respectively, with less common associations with lung toxicity. Busulfan, an alkylating agent, is well-documented to cause pulmonary fibrosis as a side effect due to its known lung toxicity. Therefore, based on standard medical knowledge and consensus, Busulfan is the most likely drug to cause pulmonary fibrosis.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
