  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Menkes Kinky Hair Syndrome is a genetic disorder that affects copper levels in the body due to a defect in the copper transporter. This defect leads to copper deficiency, which manifests as neurological symptoms, connective tissue disorders, and the characteristic kinky hair. The consensus in medical literature is that the syndrome is specifically linked to a defect in the copper transporter, which is responsible for the impaired absorption and distribution of copper in the body. The reasoning chains consistently point to the copper transporter as the underlying issue, and the retrieved validation paths support this conclusion by associating the syndrome with copper-related symptoms and deficiencies.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
