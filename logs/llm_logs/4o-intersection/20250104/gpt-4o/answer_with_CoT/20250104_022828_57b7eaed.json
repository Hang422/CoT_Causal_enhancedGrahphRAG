Monotherapy for acute episodes\nopb. Monitoring of serum concentration is not useful for guiding dose adjustment\nopc. Can result in leucocytosis\nopd. Can result in hypehyroidism on long term use\n\n### Reasoning Chains for Validation:\n- CHAIN: \"Lithium\" -> \"used in acute manic episodes\" -> \"monotherapy possible\" -> 70%\n- CHAIN: \"Lithium\" -> \"serum concentration monitoring\" -> \"guides dose adjustment\" -> 90%\n- CHAIN: \"Lithium\" -> \"increases white blood cell count\" -> \"leucocytosis\" -> 95%\n- CHAIN: \"Lithium\" -> \"long-term use\" -> \"thyroid dysfunction\" -> \"hypothyroidism\" -> 85%\n\n### Retrieved Validation Paths:\n- (Lithium)-CAUSES->(Antiinflammatory Effect)-PROCESS_OF->(Bone Marrow)-LOCATION_OF->(White Blood Cell Count procedure)\n- (Lithium)-CAUSES->(Antiinflammatory Effect)-PROCESS_OF->(Peritoneum)-LOCATION_OF->(White Blood Cell Count procedure)\n\n            ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3.

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Lithium is a well-established treatment for bipolar disorder, particularly effective in managing manic episodes. However, it is not typically used as monotherapy for acute episodes due to the need for rapid stabilization, often requiring additional medications. Monitoring serum concentration of lithium is crucial for guiding dose adjustments to maintain therapeutic levels and avoid toxicity, making option opb incorrect. Lithium is known to cause an increase in white blood cell count, leading to leucocytosis, which supports option opc. Long-term use of lithium is more commonly associated with hypothyroidism rather than hyperthyroidism, making option opd incorrect. Therefore, the most accurate statement is that lithium can result in leucocytosis.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opc\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
