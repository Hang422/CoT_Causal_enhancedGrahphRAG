Striated\nopb. Large T tubules\nopc. Troponin system present\nopd. Caldesmon is impoant regulatory protein\n\n### Reasoning Chains for Validation:\n- CHAIN: \"Cardiac muscle\" -> \"striated appearance\" -> \"similar to skeletal muscle\" -> 90%\n- CHAIN: \"Cardiac muscle\" -> \"large T tubules\" -> \"efficient calcium handling\" -> 85%\n- CHAIN: \"Cardiac muscle\" -> \"troponin system present\" -> \"regulation of contraction\" -> 95%\n- CHAIN: \"Cardiac muscle\" -> \"caldesmon as important regulatory protein\" -> \"possible conflict with known cardiac muscle regulation\" -> 70%\n\n### Retrieved Validation Paths:\n- (Myocardium)-PART_OF->(Ovarian Follicle)-LOCATION_OF->(Regulatory Protein)\n\n            ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n                \n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n            "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Cardiac muscle is known to be striated, similar to skeletal muscle, due to the presence of sarcomeres, which supports option opa. Cardiac muscle also has large T tubules, which are important for efficient calcium handling, supporting option opb. The troponin system is present in cardiac muscle, playing a crucial role in the regulation of contraction, supporting option opc. Caldesmon, however, is not a primary regulatory protein in cardiac muscle; it is more commonly associated with smooth muscle regulation. This suggests that option opd is the exception, as it does not align with the typical features of cardiac muscle.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
