Alpha IEN\nopb. Beta IFN\nopc. Gamma IFN\nopd. Natalizumab\n\n### Reasoning Chains for Validation:\n- CHAIN: \"Beta IFN\" -> \"modulates immune response\" -> \"reduces inflammation\" -> \"decreases relapse rate\" -> 95%\n- CHAIN: \"Natalizumab\" -> \"blocks immune cell migration\" -> \"prevents CNS inflammation\" -> \"reduces relapse frequency\" -> 85%\n- CHAIN: \"Gamma IFN\" -> \"possible immune modulation\" -> \"unclear effect on MS\" -> \"potential worsening of symptoms\" -> 40%\n- CHAIN: \"Alpha IEN\" -> \"unclear mechanism in MS\" -> \"no established benefit\" -> \"not recommended for MS\" -> 30%\n\n### Retrieved Validation Paths:\n- (Recombinant Interleukin-6)-CAUSES->(Hyperesthesia)-PREDISPOSES->(Disease)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Immunity)\n- (Recombinant Interleukin-6)-TREATS->(Liver Failure)-CAUSES->(Disease)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Immunity)\n- (Recombinant Interleukin-6)-TREATS->(Baculovirus)-CAUSES->(Disease)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Immunity)\n- (natalizumab)-INTERACTS_WITH->(T-Lymphocyte)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Immune Cell)\n- (natalizumab)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cells)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Immune Cell)\n- (Obstruction)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Inflammation)\n\n            ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n                \n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n            "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) is a form of multiple sclerosis characterized by episodes of new or worsening symptoms followed by periods of remission. The primary goal of treatment is to reduce the frequency and severity of relapses and to slow disease progression. Beta interferons (Beta IFN) are among the first-line treatments for RRMS. They work by modulating the immune response, reducing inflammation, and decreasing the relapse rate. Natalizumab is another effective treatment for RRMS, particularly in patients who do not respond well to first-line therapies, but it is often considered a second-line treatment due to its risk profile, including the potential for progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). Gamma interferon is not used in MS treatment as it can worsen symptoms, and Alpha IEN does not have an established role in MS management. Based on the consensus and standard medical practice, Beta IFN is the drug of choice for relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
