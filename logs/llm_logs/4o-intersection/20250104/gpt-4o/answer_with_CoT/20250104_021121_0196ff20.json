Ototoxicity\nopb. Nephrotoxicity\nopc. Coasting effect\nopd. Pulmonary fibrosis\n\n### Reasoning Chains for Validation:\n- CHAIN: \"Cisplatin\" -> \"ototoxicity\" -> \"hearing loss\" -> 95%\n- CHAIN: \"Cisplatin\" -> \"nephrotoxicity\" -> \"kidney damage\" -> 95%\n- CHAIN: \"Cisplatin\" -> \"coasting effect\" -> \"delayed neuropathy\" -> 70%\n- CHAIN: \"Cisplatin\" -> \"pulmonary fibrosis\" -> \"unclear association\" -> 60%\n\n### Retrieved Validation Paths:\n- (Cisplatin)-CAUSES->(Ototoxicity)\n- (Cisplatin)-CAUSES->(Toxic nephropathy)\n\n            ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3.

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Cisplatin is a chemotherapy drug known for several side effects. Ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity are well-documented side effects of cisplatin, with strong evidence supporting their association. The 'coasting effect' refers to a delayed onset of peripheral neuropathy, which is also associated with cisplatin, though less commonly discussed. Pulmonary fibrosis, however, is not typically associated with cisplatin. While some chemotherapeutic agents can cause pulmonary fibrosis, cisplatin is not one of them. Therefore, the most likely correct answer, based on standard medical knowledge, is that pulmonary fibrosis is not a side effect of cisplatin.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}\n```",
