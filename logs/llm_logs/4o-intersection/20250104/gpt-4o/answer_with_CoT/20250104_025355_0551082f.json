  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The question involves identifying which enzyme deficiency does not commonly result in hyperammonemia. Hyperammonemia is a condition characterized by elevated levels of ammonia in the blood, often due to disruptions in the urea cycle. The urea cycle is responsible for converting ammonia into urea for excretion. Deficiencies in enzymes directly involved in the urea cycle, such as argininosuccinate synthetase, carbamoyl phosphate synthetase (CPS-I), and ornithine transcarbamoylase (OTC), lead to an accumulation of ammonia, resulting in hyperammonemia. Ornithine amino transferase, however, is not directly involved in the urea cycle. It is primarily involved in the metabolism of ornithine and does not lead to significant ammonia accumulation when deficient. Therefore, ornithine amino transferase deficiency is the exception and does not typically cause hyperammonemia.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
