  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Ethambutol is an antitubercular medication known to cause optic nerve toxicity, which can lead to retro bulbar neuritis. This condition is characterized by visual disturbances, such as decreased visual acuity and color vision changes, particularly affecting the optic nerve. While ethambutol can have other side effects, the most well-documented and clinically significant adverse effect is retro bulbar neuritis. The other options, such as deafness, red urine, and peripheral neuritis, are not commonly associated with ethambutol. Therefore, based on standard medical knowledge and consensus, the most likely correct answer is that ethambutol causes retro bulbar neuritis.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
