  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Vitamin B12 absorption is a well-understood physiological process. Vitamin B12 binds to intrinsic factor, a glycoprotein secreted by the parietal cells of the stomach. This complex then travels through the small intestine. The intrinsic factor-B12 complex is specifically absorbed in the ileum, which is the final part of the small intestine. This is a well-established fact in medical physiology. The other options, such as the duodenum, jejunum, and colon, are not involved in the specific absorption of the intrinsic factor-B12 complex. Therefore, the most likely correct answer, based on standard medical knowledge, is that Vitamin B12 intrinsic factor absorption occurs in the ileum.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
