  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Warfarin-induced skin necrosis is a rare but serious complication that occurs due to a paradoxical hypercoagulable state. Warfarin initially reduces the levels of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors, including Protein C, which is a natural anticoagulant. In individuals with Protein C deficiency, this reduction is more pronounced, leading to a temporary hypercoagulable state and potential skin necrosis. While Protein S is also a natural anticoagulant, the effect of warfarin on Protein C is more directly linked to this condition. Hemophilia and Antithrombin III deficiency do not have a direct connection to warfarin-induced skin necrosis. Therefore, the most likely correct option is Protein C deficiency.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}\n```",
