Outer hair cells in basal area\nopb. Inner hair cells in basal area\nopc. Outer hair cells in apical area\nopd. Inner hair cells in apical area\n\n### Reasoning Chains for Validation:\n- CHAIN: \"Aminoglycoside\" -> \"ototoxicity\" -> \"damage to cochlear hair cells\" -> \"outer hair cells\" -> \"basal area\" -> 85%\n- CHAIN: \"Aminoglycoside\" -> \"ototoxicity\" -> \"damage to cochlear hair cells\" -> \"inner hair cells\" -> \"basal area\" -> 60%\n- CHAIN: \"Aminoglycoside\" -> \"ototoxicity\" -> \"damage to cochlear hair cells\" -> \"outer hair cells\" -> \"apical area\" -> 50%\n- CHAIN: \"Aminoglycoside\" -> \"ototoxicity\" -> \"damage to cochlear hair cells\" -> \"inner hair cells\" -> \"apical area\" -> 40%\n\n### Retrieved Validation Paths:\n- (Aminoglycosides)-CAUSES->(Ototoxicity)\n- (Hair Cells, Outer)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cells)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Serous cell)-PART_OF->(Structure of mitral area)\n- (Hair Cells, Outer)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cells)-PART_OF->(Entire large artery)-PART_OF->(Structure of mitral area)\n- (Hair Cells, Inner)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cells)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Serous cell)-PART_OF->(Structure of mitral area)\n- (Hair Cells, Inner)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cells)-PART_OF->(Entire large artery)-PART_OF->(Structure of mitral area)\n\n            ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3.

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Aminoglycosides are known to cause ototoxicity, primarily affecting the cochlear hair cells. The damage is more pronounced in the outer hair cells, particularly in the basal area of the cochlea. This is because the basal area is responsible for high-frequency sound detection, and aminoglycosides tend to affect these frequencies first. The consensus in medical literature supports that the outer hair cells in the basal area are most susceptible to damage from aminoglycosides.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
