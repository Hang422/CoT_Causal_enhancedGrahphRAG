Cholestyramine\nopb. Thiazide diuretics\nopc. Quinidine\nopd. Amlodipine\n\n### Reasoning Chains for Validation:\n- CHAIN: \"Cholestyramine\" -> \"binds to digoxin in the gut\" -> \"decreased absorption of digoxin\" -> \"significant drug interaction\" -> 90%\n- CHAIN: \"Thiazide diuretics\" -> \"decreased potassium levels\" -> \"increased digoxin toxicity risk\" -> \"significant drug interaction\" -> 85%\n- CHAIN: \"Quinidine\" -> \"inhibits P-glycoprotein\" -> \"increased digoxin levels\" -> \"significant drug interaction\" -> 95%\n- CHAIN: \"Amlodipine\" -> \"calcium channel blocker\" -> \"no significant effect on digoxin levels\" -> \"no significant drug interaction\" -> 90%\n\n### Retrieved Validation Paths:\n- (Digoxin)-CAUSES->(Disease)-CAUSES->(Kidney Diseases)-CAUSES->(Adverse drug interaction)\n- (Cholestyramine)-ISA->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Digoxin)\n- (Cholestyramine)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Enzymes)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Digoxin)\n- (Quinidine)-INTERACTS_WITH/ISA->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(P-Glycoproteins)-Glycoproteins)\n- (Amlodipine)-ISA->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Calcium Channel Blockers)\n- (Gastrointestinal tract structure)-LOCATION_OF->(Placebos)-ISA->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Digoxin)\n- (Calcium Channel Blockers)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Digoxin)\n\n            ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n                \n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n            "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"To determine which drug does not have a significant interaction with digoxin, we need to evaluate each option based on known pharmacological interactions. Cholestyramine binds to digoxin in the gastrointestinal tract, reducing its absorption and thus has a significant interaction. Thiazide diuretics can lead to hypokalemia, which increases the risk of digoxin toxicity, indicating a significant interaction. Quinidine inhibits P-glycoprotein, leading to increased digoxin levels and a significant interaction. Amlodipine, a calcium channel blocker, does not significantly affect digoxin levels or its pharmacokinetics, suggesting no significant interaction. Therefore, the most likely correct answer is that amlodipine does not have a significant interaction with digoxin.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}\n```",
