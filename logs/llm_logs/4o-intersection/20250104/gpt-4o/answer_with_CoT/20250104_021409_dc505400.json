  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Imipramine is a tricyclic antidepressant known for its anticholinergic properties, which can reduce bladder contractions and thus decrease nocturnal enuresis. This mechanism makes it a suitable choice for treating bedwetting. Other options like Fluvoxamine, Phenelzine, and Bupropion do not have direct effects on the bladder that would make them effective for nocturnal enuresis. Therefore, based on standard medical knowledge and consensus, Imipramine is the most likely correct option.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
