INH\nopb. Erythromycin estolate\nopc. Pyrazinamide\nopd. Ethionamide\n\n### Reasoning Chains for Validation:\n- CHAIN: \"Erythromycin estolate\" -> \"liver enzyme inhibition\" -> \"impaired bile flow\" -> \"cholestatic jaundice\" -> 95%\n- CHAIN: \"INH\" -> \"liver enzyme alteration\" -> \"hepatitis\" -> \"possible jaundice\" -> 60%\n- CHAIN: \"Pyrazinamide\" -> \"liver toxicity\" -> \"hepatitis\" -> \"possible jaundice\" -> 55%\n- CHAIN: \"Ethionamide\" -> \"liver enzyme alteration\" -> \"hepatitis\" -> \"possible jaundice\" -> 50%\n\n### Retrieved Validation Paths:\n- (Pyrazinamide)-TREATS->(Disease)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(paracrine)-PROCESS_OF->(Liver)\n- (Pyrazinamide)-TREATS->(Obesity)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(paracrine)-PROCESS_OF->(Liver)\n- (isoniazid)-PREVENTS/TREATS->(Complication)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Liver enzyme)\n- (Ethionamide)-PREVENTS->(Complication)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Liver enzyme)\n- (Pyrazinamide)-PREVENTS->(Complication)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Biological Transport, Active)-PROCESS_OF->(Liver)\n\n            ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n                \n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n            "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Cholestatic jaundice is a condition where there is an impairment in bile flow, leading to the accumulation of bile components in the liver and bloodstream. Among the options provided, erythromycin estolate is well-documented to cause cholestatic jaundice. This is due to its ability to inhibit liver enzymes and impair bile flow, leading to the characteristic symptoms of cholestatic jaundice. INH (isoniazid), pyrazinamide, and ethionamide are more commonly associated with hepatocellular damage and hepatitis rather than cholestatic jaundice. Therefore, based on standard medical knowledge and consensus, erythromycin estolate is the most likely cause of cholestatic jaundice among the options given.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
