Salbutamol\nopb. Ketotifen\nopc. Fluticasone\nopd. Monteleukast\n\n### Reasoning Chains for Validation:\n- CHAIN: \"Salbutamol\" -> \"beta adrenergic agonist\" -> \"bronchodilation\" -> \"aerosol form available\" -> \"treatment of bronchial asthma\" -> 95%\n- CHAIN: \"Ketotifen\" -> \"antihistamine\" -> \"not a beta adrenergic agonist\" -> \"not typically used as aerosol\" -> \"less likely for bronchial asthma treatment\" -> 20%\n- CHAIN: \"Fluticasone\" -> \"corticosteroid\" -> \"anti-inflammatory\" -> \"aerosol form available\" -> \"not a beta adrenergic agonist\" -> \"used in asthma management\" -> 60%\n- CHAIN: \"Monteleukast\" -> \"leukotriene receptor antagonist\" -> \"oral administration\" -> \"not a beta adrenergic agonist\" -> \"not used as aerosol\" -> \"less likely for bronchial asthma treatment\" -> 10%\n\n### Retrieved Validation Paths:\n- (Albuterol)-INTERACTS_WITH/ISA->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Adrenergic beta-Agonists)-Agonists)\n- (fluticasone)-ISA->(Adrenal Cortex Hormones)\n- (Histamine Antagonists)-ISA->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Adrenergic beta-Agonists)\n- (Histamine Antagonists)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Stimulant)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Adrenergic beta-Agonists)\n- (Ketotifen)-ISA->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Preservative free ingredient)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Histamine Antagonists)\n- (Ketotifen)-ISA->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Sedatives)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Histamine Antagonists)\n\n            ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3.

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The question asks for a beta adrenergic agonist used as an aerosol for the treatment of bronchial asthma. Salbutamol, also known as albuterol, is a well-known beta-2 adrenergic agonist that causes bronchodilation and is commonly used in aerosol form (inhalers) for the treatment of bronchial asthma. Ketotifen is an antihistamine and not a beta adrenergic agonist, and it is not typically used in aerosol form for asthma. Fluticasone is a corticosteroid used in asthma management but is not a beta adrenergic agonist. Montelukast is a leukotriene receptor antagonist, administered orally, and not used as an aerosol. Therefore, based on standard medical knowledge, Salbutamol is the most appropriate choice.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
