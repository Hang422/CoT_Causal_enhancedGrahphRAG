  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Brinzolamide is a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor used primarily in the treatment of glaucoma. It works by inhibiting the enzyme carbonic anhydrase, which reduces the production of aqueous humor in the eye, thereby lowering intraocular pressure. The inhibition by brinzolamide is known to be reversible and competitive. This is consistent with the mechanism of action of many carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, which typically bind reversibly to the active site of the enzyme, competing with the substrate. Therefore, the most likely correct option is that brinzolamide is a highly specific reversible and competitive carbonic anhydrase inhibitor.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opc\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
