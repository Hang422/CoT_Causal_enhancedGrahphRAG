  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Schizophrenia is primarily associated with dysregulation of dopamine pathways in the brain, leading to symptoms such as hallucinations, delusions, and cognitive impairments. The mainstay of treatment for schizophrenia is antipsychotic medications, which work by blocking dopamine receptors, thereby alleviating the positive symptoms of the disorder. While antidepressants, antiepileptics, and mood stabilizers can be used adjunctively in certain cases to address specific symptoms or comorbid conditions, they are not the primary treatment for schizophrenia. Antipsychotics are the most effective and widely accepted treatment for managing the core symptoms of schizophrenia.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
