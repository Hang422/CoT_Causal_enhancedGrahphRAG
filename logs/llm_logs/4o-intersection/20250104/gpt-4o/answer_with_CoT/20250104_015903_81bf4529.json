Patient gives history of recurrent bacterial infections. Ophthalmic examination reveals white triangular plaques on conjunctiva. This patient is suffering from deficiency of:\n\n            ### Options\n            opa. Vitamin D\nopb. Vitamin B\nopc. Vitamin A\nopd. Vitamin C\n\n### Reasoning Chains for Validation:\n- CHAIN: \"Night vision problems\" -> \"Vitamin A deficiency\" -> \"Decreased rhodopsin production\" -> \"Night blindness\" -> 85%\n- CHAIN: \"Dryness of eyes\" -> \"Vitamin A deficiency\" -> \"Decreased tear production\" -> \"Dry eyes\" -> 80%\n- CHAIN: \"Recurrent bacterial infections\" -> \"Vitamin A deficiency\" -> \"Impaired immune function\" -> \"Increased infection risk\" -> 75%\n- CHAIN: \"White triangular plaques on conjunctiva\" -> \"Bitot's spots\" -> \"Vitamin A deficiency\" -> 90%\n- CHAIN: \"Vitamin A deficiency\" -> \"Epithelial cell dysfunction\" -> \"Dry eyes and Bitot's spots\" -> 85%\n\n### Retrieved Validation Paths:\n- (Eye)-LOCATION_OF->(Vitamin A Deficiency)\n- (Bacterial Infections)-CAUSES->(Disease)-CAUSES->(Vitamin A Deficiency)\n- (Bacterial Infections)-CAUSES->(Infection)-CAUSES->(Vitamin A Deficiency)\n- (Vitamin A Deficiency)-PREDISPOSES->(Pathogenesis)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Rhodopsin)\n\n            ### Task:\n                1.

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The symptoms presented by the patient align closely with Vitamin A deficiency. Night vision problems are indicative of decreased rhodopsin production, which is directly linked to Vitamin A deficiency. The dryness of eyes can be attributed to decreased tear production, another consequence of Vitamin A deficiency. Recurrent bacterial infections suggest impaired immune function, which is also associated with a lack of Vitamin A. The presence of white triangular plaques on the conjunctiva, known as Bitot's spots, is a classic sign of Vitamin A deficiency. Each symptom and sign points towards Vitamin A deficiency, making it the most likely cause of the patient's condition.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opc\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}\n```",
