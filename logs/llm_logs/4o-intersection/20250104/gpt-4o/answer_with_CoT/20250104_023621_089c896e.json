He has a history of being treated for duodenal ulcer 4 years back. Investigation reveals elevation of gastrin levels. Which of the following statement is true regarding gastrin?\n\n            ### Options\n            opa. Secreted by parietal cells of stomach\nopb. Secreted by alpha ceils of pancreas\nopc. Decreases bicarbonate content in pancreatic secretion\nopd. It gets stimulated by endoluminal peptides in stomach\n\n### Reasoning Chains for Validation:\n- CHAIN: \"Gastrin\" -> \"secreted by G cells in stomach\" -> \"stimulated by peptides in stomach\" -> 90%\n- CHAIN: \"Gastrin\" -> \"stimulated by endoluminal peptides\" -> \"increased gastric acid secretion\" -> 85%\n- CHAIN: \"Gastrin\" -> \"elevated levels\" -> \"possible Zollinger-Ellison syndrome\" -> 80%\n- CHAIN: \"Gastrin\" -> \"not secreted by parietal cells\" -> \"secreted by G cells\" -> 95%\n- CHAIN: \"Gastrin\" -> \"not secreted by alpha cells of pancreas\" -> \"secreted by G cells in stomach\" -> 95%\n- CHAIN: \"Gastrin\" -> \"does not decrease bicarbonate content\" -> \"increases gastric acid secretion\" -> 90%\n\n### Retrieved Validation Paths:\n- (Gastrins)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cells)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Parietal Cells, Gastric)\n- (Gastrins)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cells)-LOCATION_OF->(Bicarbonates)\n- (Gastrin-Secreting Cells)-PART_OF->(Stomach)\n- (Gastrins)-TREATS->(Obesity)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(paracrine)-PROCESS_OF->(Stomach)\n- (Gastrins)-TREATS->(Disease)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Respiration)-PROCESS_OF->(Stomach)\n- (Gastrins)-TREATS->(Obesity)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Respiration)-PROCESS_OF->(Stomach)\n- (Gastrins)-TREATS->(Obesity)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(paracrine)-PROCESS_OF->(Pancreas)\n- (Gastrins)-TREATS->(Disease)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(immune resistance)-PROCESS_OF->(Pancreas)\n\n            ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2.

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Gastrin is a hormone primarily secreted by G cells located in the antrum of the stomach. It plays a crucial role in stimulating gastric acid secretion. The secretion of gastrin is stimulated by the presence of peptides and amino acids in the stomach, which are endoluminal peptides. This aligns with the physiological role of gastrin in promoting digestion by increasing gastric acid production. The other options are incorrect: gastrin is not secreted by parietal cells (which secrete hydrochloric acid), nor by alpha cells of the pancreas (which secrete glucagon). Additionally, gastrin does not decrease bicarbonate content in pancreatic secretion; rather, it is involved in increasing gastric acid secretion. Therefore, the statement that gastrin gets stimulated by endoluminal peptides in the stomach is the most accurate.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
