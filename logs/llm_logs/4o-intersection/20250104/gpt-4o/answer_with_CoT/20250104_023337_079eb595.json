  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"In HIV positive patients on antiretroviral therapy, drug interactions are a critical consideration when adding anti-tubercular drugs. Rifampicin is a potent inducer of cytochrome P450 enzymes, which can significantly reduce the plasma levels of protease inhibitors like indinavir, leading to decreased efficacy of the HIV treatment regimen. This interaction is well-documented and is a primary reason to avoid rifampicin in patients on protease inhibitors. The other anti-tubercular drugs listed (pyrazinamide, isoniazid, and ethambutol) do not have significant interactions with the antiretroviral drugs zidovudine, lamivudine, and indinavir. Therefore, the most likely correct option to avoid is rifampicin.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
