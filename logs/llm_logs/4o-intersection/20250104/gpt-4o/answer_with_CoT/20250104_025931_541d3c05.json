Chloroquine\nopb. Betamethasone\nopc. Chloramphenicol\nopd. Zidovudine\n\n### Reasoning Chains for Validation:\n- CHAIN: \"Chloroquine\" -> \"antimalarial drug\" -> \"known to cause myopathy\" -> 70%\n- CHAIN: \"Betamethasone\" -> \"corticosteroid\" -> \"muscle weakness possible\" -> \"myopathy possible\" -> 60%\n- CHAIN: \"Chloramphenicol\" -> \"antibiotic\" -> \"no known association with myopathy\" -> 80%\n- CHAIN: \"Zidovudine\" -> \"antiretroviral drug\" -> \"known to cause myopathy\" -> 70%\n\n### Retrieved Validation Paths:\n- (Betamethasone)-INTERACTS_WITH/ISA->(Adrenal Cortex Hormones)\n- (Antimalarials)-CAUSES->(Myopathy)\n- (Chloroquine)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Antimalarials)\n\n            ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3.

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"To determine which drug does not cause myopathy, we need to evaluate each option based on their known side effects. Chloroquine is an antimalarial drug that is known to cause myopathy as a side effect. Betamethasone is a corticosteroid, and while it can cause muscle weakness, it is not primarily associated with myopathy, though it can contribute to it indirectly. Chloramphenicol is an antibiotic with no known association with myopathy, making it the least likely to cause this condition. Zidovudine, an antiretroviral drug, is known to cause myopathy. Based on this analysis, Chloramphenicol is the drug that does not cause myopathy. Therefore, the most likely correct answer is 'opc. Chloramphenicol'.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opc\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}\n```",
