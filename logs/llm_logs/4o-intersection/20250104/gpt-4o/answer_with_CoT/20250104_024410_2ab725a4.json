  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"In the context of chemotherapy-induced vomiting, multiple drugs are used to manage symptoms due to their different mechanisms of action. Aprepitant is an NK1 receptor antagonist that blocks substance P, which is involved in the vomiting reflex. Dexamethasone is a corticosteroid that can reduce inflammation and has antiemetic properties, often used in combination with other antiemetics. Ondansetron is a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist that blocks serotonin, a key neurotransmitter involved in nausea and vomiting. Each of these drugs targets different pathways involved in chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, and they are often used together to provide a more comprehensive antiemetic effect. Therefore, the most likely correct answer is 'All of the above' as they are all used in this context.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
