Thiamine\nopb. Pyridoxine\nopc. Niacin\nopd. Riboflavin\n\n### Reasoning Chains for Validation:\n- CHAIN: \"INH\" -> \"interferes with pyridoxine metabolism\" -> \"pyridoxine deficiency\" -> \"neuropathy\" -> \"pyridoxine supplementation\" -> 95%\n- CHAIN: \"INH\" -> \"pyridoxine deficiency\" -> \"peripheral neuropathy\" -> \"pyridoxine corrects deficiency\" -> \"symptom improvement\" -> 90%\n- CHAIN: \"INH\" -> \"decreased pyridoxine levels\" -> \"nerve damage\" -> \"pyridoxine administration\" -> \"nerve function restoration\" -> 92%\n- CHAIN: \"INH\" -> \"pyridoxine depletion\" -> \"neuropathy symptoms\" -> \"pyridoxine replenishment\" -> \"symptom resolution\" -> 93%\n\n### Retrieved Validation Paths:\n- (pyridoxine)-TREATS->(Neuropathy)\n- (isoniazid)-TREATS->(Disease)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(uptake)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(pyridoxine)\n- (isoniazid)-TREATS->(Symptoms)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(uptake)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(pyridoxine)\n- (Neuropathy)-ISA/MANIFESTATION_OF->(Disease)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Saccharomyces cerevisiae)-LOCATION_OF->(pyridoxine)\n- (Peripheral Neuropathy)-ISA/MANIFESTATION_OF->(Disease)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Saccharomyces cerevisiae)-LOCATION_OF->(pyridoxine)\n- (isoniazid)-TREATS->(Vitamin B 6 Deficiency)\n\n            ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3.

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Isoniazid (INH) is known to interfere with the metabolism of pyridoxine (vitamin B6), leading to a deficiency. This deficiency can result in peripheral neuropathy, a common side effect of INH therapy. The standard treatment for INH-induced neuropathy is supplementation with pyridoxine, which helps to replenish the depleted vitamin B6 levels and alleviate the symptoms of neuropathy. The reasoning chains consistently point to pyridoxine as the treatment for INH-induced neuropathy, and this is supported by standard medical practice.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
