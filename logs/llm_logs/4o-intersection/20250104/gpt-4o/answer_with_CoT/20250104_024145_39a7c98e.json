Pylori treatment:\n\n            ### Options\n            opa. Amoxicillin\nopb. Vancomycin\nopc. Metronidazole\nopd. Clotrimazole\n\n### Reasoning Chains for Validation:\n- CHAIN: \"Amoxicillin\" -> \"broad-spectrum antibiotic\" -> \"part of anti H. Pylori treatment\" -> 70%\n- CHAIN: \"Vancomycin\" -> \"treatment for antibiotic-associated pseudomembranous enterocolitis\" -> \"not typically part of anti H. Pylori treatment\" -> 60%\n- CHAIN: \"Metronidazole\" -> \"effective against anaerobic bacteria\" -> \"part of anti H. Pylori treatment\" -> 80%\n- CHAIN: \"Clotrimazole\" -> \"antifungal medication\" -> \"not used for bacterial infections\" -> 10%\n\n### Retrieved Validation Paths:\n- (Metronidazole)-TREATS->(Infection)-PROCESS_OF->(Bacteria, Anaerobic)\n- (Metronidazole)-TREATS->(Lung Abscess)-PROCESS_OF->(Bacteria, Anaerobic)\n- (Metronidazole)-TREATS->(Gangrenous pneumonia)-PROCESS_OF->(Bacteria, Anaerobic)\n\n            ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n                \n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n            "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Pseudomembranous enterocolitis, often caused by Clostridioides difficile, is commonly treated with metronidazole or vancomycin. Metronidazole is effective against anaerobic bacteria, which includes C. difficile. Additionally, metronidazole is a well-known component of the treatment regimen for Helicobacter pylori infections, often used in combination with other antibiotics and a proton pump inhibitor. While vancomycin is also used for pseudomembranous enterocolitis, it is not typically part of the H. pylori treatment regimen. Amoxicillin is part of the H. pylori treatment but not used for pseudomembranous enterocolitis. Clotrimazole is an antifungal and not relevant to bacterial infections. Therefore, metronidazole is the drug that fits both criteria: treating pseudomembranous enterocolitis and being part of the H. pylori treatment regimen.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opc\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
