Vasopressin\nopb. Terlipressin\nopc. Desmopressin\nopd. Pralipressin\n\n### Reasoning Chains for Validation:\n- CHAIN: \"Neurogenic diabetes insipidus\" -> \"deficiency of vasopressin\" -> \"need for vasopressin replacement\" -> \"Desmopressin\" -> 95%\n- CHAIN: \"Neurogenic diabetes insipidus\" -> \"central cause\" -> \"synthetic vasopressin analog needed\" -> \"Desmopressin\" -> 90%\n- CHAIN: \"Neurogenic diabetes insipidus\" -> \"polyuria and polydipsia\" -> \"vasopressin analog to reduce symptoms\" -> \"Desmopressin\" -> 92%\n- CHAIN: \"Neurogenic diabetes insipidus\" -> \"lack of antidiuretic hormone\" -> \"Desmopressin as synthetic replacement\" -> 93%\n- CHAIN: \"Neurogenic diabetes insipidus\" -> \"treatment with vasopressin analog\" -> \"Desmopressin preferred\" -> 90%\n\n### Retrieved Validation Paths:\n- (Vasopressin Analog)-TREATS->(Hepatorenal Syndrome)-CAUSES->(Complication)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Deamino Arginine Vasopressin)\n- (Vasopressin Analog)-TREATS->(Central Diabetes Insipidus)-PREDISPOSES->(Complication)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Deamino Arginine Vasopressin)\n- (Central Diabetes Insipidus)-CAUSES/COMPLICATES->(Disease)-COMPLICATES->(Inflammatory Response)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(human AVP protein)\n\n            ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n                \n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n            "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Neurogenic diabetes insipidus, also known as central diabetes insipidus, is characterized by a deficiency of vasopressin (antidiuretic hormone) due to a problem in the hypothalamus or pituitary gland. The treatment involves replacing the deficient hormone. Desmopressin is a synthetic analog of vasopressin that is specifically designed to treat this condition. It is preferred due to its longer duration of action and fewer side effects compared to vasopressin itself. Other options like terlipressin and pralipressin are not typically used for this condition. Therefore, based on standard medical knowledge and consensus, Desmopressin is the drug of choice for neurogenic diabetes insipidus.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opc\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
