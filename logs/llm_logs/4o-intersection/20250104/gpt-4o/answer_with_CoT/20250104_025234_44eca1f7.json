  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH) is a condition characterized by an enlarged prostate, which can lead to urinary symptoms. Alpha-1 adrenergic blockers are commonly used to provide symptomatic relief in BPH by relaxing the smooth muscle in the prostate and bladder neck, thereby improving urine flow. Tamsulosin is a well-known alpha-1 adrenergic blocker specifically used for BPH due to its selectivity for alpha-1A receptors in the prostate, leading to effective symptom relief. Prazosin is also an alpha-1 blocker but is less commonly used for BPH compared to Tamsulosin. Oxazocin is not a recognized medication for BPH, and Dolazoline does not have a clear role in treating BPH. Based on the consensus and the specific targeting of Tamsulosin for BPH, it is the most likely correct option.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
