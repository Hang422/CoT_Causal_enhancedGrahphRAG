Vitamin A\nopb. Vitamin K\nopc. Vitamin E\nopd. Vitamin D\n\n### Reasoning Chains for Validation:\n- CHAIN: \"Vitamin A\" -> \"retinoids\" -> \"vision and skin health\" -> \"not a coenzyme\" -> 20%\n- CHAIN: \"Vitamin K\" -> \"coagulation factors\" -> \"gamma-carboxylation\" -> \"functions as a coenzyme\" -> 95%\n- CHAIN: \"Vitamin E\" -> \"antioxidant\" -> \"protects cell membranes\" -> \"not a coenzyme\" -> 20%\n- CHAIN: \"Vitamin D\" -> \"calcium homeostasis\" -> \"bone health\" -> \"not a coenzyme\" -> 20%\n\n### Retrieved Validation Paths:\n- (Vitamin K)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Pathogenesis)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Blood Coagulation Factor)\n- (Vitamin K)-CAUSES->(Complication)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Blood Coagulation Factor)\n- (Vitamin E)-INTERACTS_WITH/ISA->(Antioxidants)\n- (Vitamin A)-PART_OF->(Cells)-LOCATION_OF->(Retinoids)\n- (Vitamin A)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cultured Cells)-LOCATION_OF->(Retinoids)\n\n            ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n                \n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n            "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Vitamin K is well-known for its role in the post-translational modification of certain proteins required for blood coagulation. It functions as a coenzyme for the enzyme gamma-glutamyl carboxylase, which is responsible for the carboxylation of glutamic acid residues on these proteins. This carboxylation is essential for the biological activity of the coagulation factors. The other vitamins listed do not function as coenzymes: Vitamin A is involved in vision and skin health, Vitamin E acts as an antioxidant, and Vitamin D is crucial for calcium homeostasis and bone health. Therefore, based on standard medical knowledge, Vitamin K is the only fat-soluble vitamin among the options that functions as a coenzyme.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
