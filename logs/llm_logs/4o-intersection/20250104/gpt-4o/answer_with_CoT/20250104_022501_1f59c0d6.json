  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The patient presents with palmar xanthomas, elevated IDL and chylomicrons, and an increased risk of atherosclerosis and coronary artery disease (CAD). These symptoms are characteristic of Type III Hyperlipoproteinemia, also known as Familial Dysbetalipoproteinemia. This condition is primarily caused by a deficiency in Apo E, which is crucial for the clearance of chylomicron remnants and IDL from the bloodstream. The impaired clearance leads to the accumulation of these lipoproteins, resulting in elevated cholesterol and triglyceride levels, and the formation of xanthomas. The presence of palmar xanthomas is particularly indicative of this condition. Therefore, the most likely pathophysiology is Apo E deficiency.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
