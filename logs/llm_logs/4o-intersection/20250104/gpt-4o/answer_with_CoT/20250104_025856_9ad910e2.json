Directly simulated by fall in PaO2\nopb. Connected with cardiac center\nopc. Inhibited during swallowing\nopd. Situated in midbrain\n\n### Reasoning Chains for Validation:\n- CHAIN: \"Respiratory centre\" -> \"located in brainstem\" -> \"connected with cardiac center\" -> 85%\n- CHAIN: \"Respiratory centre\" -> \"located in brainstem\" -> \"inhibited during swallowing\" -> 80%\n- CHAIN: \"Respiratory centre\" -> \"located in brainstem\" -> \"not directly stimulated by fall in PaO2\" -> 70%\n- CHAIN: \"Respiratory centre\" -> \"located in brainstem\" -> \"not situated in midbrain\" -> 90%\n\n### Retrieved Validation Paths:\n- (Brain Stem)-LOCATION_OF->(Lipopolysaccharides)-PART_OF->(Blood arterial)-LOCATION_OF->(PO2 measurement)\n\n            ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3.

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The respiratory center is primarily located in the brainstem, specifically in the medulla oblongata and pons, not the midbrain. It is not directly stimulated by a fall in PaO2; rather, it is more sensitive to changes in PaCO2 and pH levels. The respiratory center is connected with the cardiac center as both are part of the autonomic nervous system and are located in the brainstem, which coordinates respiratory and cardiovascular functions. During swallowing, the respiratory center is temporarily inhibited to prevent aspiration, which is a protective reflex. Therefore, the most accurate statement is that the respiratory center is inhibited during swallowing.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opc\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}",
