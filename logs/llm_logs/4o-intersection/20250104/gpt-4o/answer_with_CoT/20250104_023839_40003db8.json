If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3.

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"In patients undergoing cancer surgery, there is an increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) due to both the malignancy and the surgical procedure. Prophylaxis is essential to prevent VTE in these patients. Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) is the anticoagulant of choice for this purpose. It is preferred over unfractionated heparin (heparin sulfate) because it has a more predictable pharmacokinetic profile, does not require routine monitoring, and has a lower risk of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. Warfarin is not ideal for immediate prophylaxis due to its delayed onset of action and need for monitoring. Protamine sulfate is not an anticoagulant; it is used to reverse the effects of heparin. Therefore, the most appropriate choice for VTE prophylaxis in cancer surgery patients is low molecular weight heparin.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opc\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
