  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"In the case of a needle stick injury involving a patient with a very high viral load and low CD4 count, the risk of HIV transmission is significant. The standard medical practice for post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) in such high-risk situations is to initiate treatment as soon as possible. The recommended regimen typically includes a combination of antiretroviral drugs to maximize efficacy. Zidovudine (AZT) and lamivudine (3TC) are commonly used together as part of a PEP regimen. The duration of PEP is generally 4 weeks to ensure adequate exposure to the antiretrovirals to prevent seroconversion. Monitoring alone is not sufficient as it does not prevent transmission, and a 2-week course of zidovudine alone may be inadequate. Acyclovir is not indicated as it is used for herpes viruses, not HIV. Therefore, the most appropriate action is to administer zidovudine with lamivudine for 4 weeks.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
