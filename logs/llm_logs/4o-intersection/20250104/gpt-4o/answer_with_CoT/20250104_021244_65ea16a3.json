Vitamin A\nopb. Vitamin B\nopc. Vitamin C\nopd. Vitamin E\n\n### Reasoning Chains for Validation:\n- CHAIN: \"Nyctalopia\" -> \"impaired night vision\" -> \"retinal function affected\" -> \"Vitamin A deficiency\" -> 95%\n- CHAIN: \"Nyctalopia\" -> \"rod cell dysfunction\" -> \"retinal health compromised\" -> \"Vitamin A deficiency\" -> 90%\n- CHAIN: \"Nyctalopia\" -> \"visual pigment rhodopsin affected\" -> \"Vitamin A deficiency\" -> 85%\n- CHAIN: \"Nyctalopia\" -> \"possible nutritional deficiency\" -> \"Vitamin A deficiency\" -> 80%\n- CHAIN: \"Nyctalopia\" -> \"Vitamin A deficiency\" -> \"impaired night vision\" -> 90%\n\n### Retrieved Validation Paths:\n- (Malnutrition)-CAUSES->(Vitamin A Deficiency)\n- (Night Blindness)-CAUSES->(Blind Vision)-CAUSES->(Vitamin A Deficiency)\n- (Night Blindness)-PREDISPOSES->(Deficiency, Vitamin)-CAUSES->(Vitamin A Deficiency)\n- (Night Blindness)-CAUSES->(Anemia)-PREDISPOSES->(Vitamin A Deficiency)\n\n            ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2.

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Nyctalopia, commonly known as night blindness, is primarily associated with impaired night vision due to the dysfunction of rod cells in the retina. Rod cells are responsible for vision in low-light conditions and rely on the visual pigment rhodopsin, which requires Vitamin A for its synthesis. A deficiency in Vitamin A leads to a decrease in rhodopsin production, resulting in night blindness. This is a well-established medical fact, supported by multiple reasoning chains and validation paths. Other vitamins listed do not have a direct link to night blindness. Therefore, the most likely correct option is Vitamin A deficiency.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
