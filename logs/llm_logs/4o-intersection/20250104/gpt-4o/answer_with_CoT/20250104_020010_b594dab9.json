  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Bleeding oesophageal varices are a serious complication of portal hypertension, often seen in patients with liver cirrhosis. The primary goal in managing acute variceal bleeding is to reduce portal pressure and control the bleeding. Octreotide, a somatostatin analogue, is commonly used as it causes vasoconstriction of the splanchnic circulation, leading to reduced portal pressure and effective control of bleeding. Propranolol is used for the prevention of variceal bleeding by reducing portal hypertension but is not the drug of choice for acute bleeding. Ethanolamine oleate is used in sclerotherapy to obliterate varices but is not the first-line pharmacological treatment. Phytonadione (vitamin K) is used to improve coagulation but does not directly address the cause of variceal bleeding. Therefore, based on standard medical practice and consensus, Octreotide is the drug of choice for acute bleeding oesophageal varices.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
