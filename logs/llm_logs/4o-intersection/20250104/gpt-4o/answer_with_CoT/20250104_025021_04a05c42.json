Penicillin G\nopb. Tetracycline\nopc. Azithromycin\nopd. Doxycycline\n\n### Reasoning Chains for Validation:\n- CHAIN: \"Treponema Pallidum\" -> \"causes syphilis\" -> \"Penicillin G effective against syphilis\" -> \"Penicillin G is drug of choice\" -> 95%\n- CHAIN: \"Treponema Pallidum\" -> \"causes syphilis\" -> \"Tetracycline alternative treatment\" -> \"less effective than Penicillin G\" -> 70%\n- CHAIN: \"Treponema Pallidum\" -> \"causes syphilis\" -> \"Azithromycin sometimes used\" -> \"resistance concerns\" -> \"not first-line treatment\" -> 60%\n- CHAIN: \"Treponema Pallidum\" -> \"causes syphilis\" -> \"Doxycycline alternative treatment\" -> \"used in penicillin allergy\" -> \"less effective than Penicillin G\" -> 75%\n\n### Retrieved Validation Paths:\n- (Syphilis)-ASSOCIATED_WITH/PROCESS_OF->(Bacteria)-LOCATION_OF->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)\n\n            ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3.

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Treponema pallidum is the bacterium responsible for syphilis. The standard and most effective treatment for syphilis, particularly in its early stages, is Penicillin G. This is supported by decades of clinical practice and guidelines from major health organizations, which consistently recommend Penicillin G as the first-line treatment for syphilis. While alternatives like tetracycline and doxycycline can be used in cases of penicillin allergy, they are not considered as effective as Penicillin G. Azithromycin is sometimes used, but concerns about resistance make it less favorable. Therefore, based on medical consensus, Penicillin G is the drug of choice for Treponema pallidum infections.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
