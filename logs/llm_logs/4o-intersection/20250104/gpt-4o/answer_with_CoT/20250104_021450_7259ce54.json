It has good blood-brain barrier penetrability\nopb. It causes pronounced tachycardia\nopc. It does not activate adrenergic b receptors\nopd. It does not activate peripheral dopaminergic receptors\n\n### Reasoning Chains for Validation:\n- CHAIN: \"Dobutamine\" -> \"selective beta-1 adrenergic agonist\" -> \"increased heart contractility\" -> \"minimal peripheral dopaminergic receptor activation\" -> 85%\n- CHAIN: \"Dopamine\" -> \"beta-1 adrenergic agonist\" -> \"peripheral dopaminergic receptor activation\" -> \"increased renal blood flow\" -> 80%\n- CHAIN: \"Dobutamine\" -> \"beta-1 adrenergic receptor activation\" -> \"increased heart rate\" -> \"pronounced tachycardia\" -> 75%\n- CHAIN: \"Dobutamine\" -> \"poor blood-brain barrier penetrability\" -> \"limited central nervous system effects\" -> 70%\n- CHAIN: \"Dopamine\" -> \"beta-1 and dopaminergic receptor activation\" -> \"increased heart rate and renal perfusion\" -> \"different receptor profile from dobutamine\" -> 80%\n\n### Retrieved Validation Paths:\n- (Dobutamine)-CAUSES->(Blood Circulation)-PROCESS_OF->(Blood - brain barrier anatomy)\n\n            ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n                \n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n            "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Dobutamine is primarily a selective beta-1 adrenergic agonist, which means it primarily increases heart contractility and has minimal effects on peripheral dopaminergic receptors. In contrast, dopamine acts on both beta-1 adrenergic receptors and peripheral dopaminergic receptors, which can increase renal blood flow. Dobutamine does not activate peripheral dopaminergic receptors, which is a key difference from dopamine. Therefore, the most likely correct option is that dobutamine does not activate peripheral dopaminergic receptors, distinguishing it from dopamine.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}\n```",
