  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Adrenal insufficiency, such as in Addison's disease, is characterized by decreased production of aldosterone and cortisol. This leads to decreased sodium reabsorption and decreased potassium excretion, resulting in hyponatremia and hyperkalemia, respectively. Additionally, decreased cortisol levels lead to reduced gluconeogenesis, causing hypoglycemia. Metabolic acidosis is more likely due to decreased hydrogen ion excretion, not metabolic alkalosis. Therefore, metabolic alkalosis is not associated with adrenal insufficiency.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
