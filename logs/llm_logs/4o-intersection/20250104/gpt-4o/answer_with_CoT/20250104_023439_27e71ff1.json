  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"In patients with coronary artery disease and elevated LDL cholesterol levels, the primary goal is to reduce LDL cholesterol to lower the risk of atherosclerosis and subsequent cardiovascular events. Statins are the first-line therapy for lowering LDL cholesterol due to their proven efficacy in reducing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Other options like gemfibrozil, nicotinic acid, and bile acid binding resins are not as effective as statins in reducing LDL cholesterol and are typically used in specific situations or as adjuncts to statin therapy. Given the patient's LDL level of 150-165 mg/dL and the presence of coronary artery disease, statins are the most appropriate initial therapy. This aligns with standard medical guidelines and consensus.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
