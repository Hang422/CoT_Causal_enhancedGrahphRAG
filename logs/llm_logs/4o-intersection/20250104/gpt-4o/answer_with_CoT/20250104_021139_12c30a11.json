Krabbe's disease\nopb. Fabry's disease\nopc. Fragile syndrome\nopd.

If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3.

Krabbe's disease is a lysosomal storage disorder affecting the nervous system, Fabry's disease is a lysosomal storage disorder affecting the skin, kidneys, heart, and nervous system, and Fragile X syndrome is a genetic condition causing intellectual disability. None of these conditions are related to glycogen metabolism. Therefore, all the options listed are not glycogen storage diseases.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
