  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The treatment of urethritis, whether gonococcal or non-gonococcal, requires antibiotics that are effective against the causative organisms. Gonococcal urethritis is caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae, while non-gonococcal urethritis is often caused by Chlamydia trachomatis. Azithromycin is a macrolide antibiotic that is effective against both Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis, making it a suitable choice for treating both types of urethritis. Clindamycin and Metronidazole are primarily effective against anaerobic bacteria and are not typically used for these infections. Cefepime, while a broad-spectrum cephalosporin, is not the standard treatment for urethritis. Therefore, Azithromycin is the most appropriate choice based on its effectiveness against the pathogens responsible for both gonococcal and non-gonococcal urethritis.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
