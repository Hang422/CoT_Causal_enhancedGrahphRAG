  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The stomach is known to secrete several substances that aid in digestion. Pepsinogens are secreted by the stomach and are converted into pepsin in the acidic environment created by hydrochloric acid (HCl), which is also secreted by the stomach. Gastric lipase is another enzyme secreted by the stomach, although it plays a minor role compared to pancreatic lipase in lipid digestion. While lipase is primarily associated with the pancreas, gastric lipase is indeed secreted by the stomach. Therefore, all the options listed are secreted by the stomach, making 'None' the incorrect choice. However, considering the context of the question, the focus is on identifying which is not primarily secreted by the stomach, and lipase is more prominently secreted by the pancreas. Thus, the best-supported option is that lipase is not primarily secreted by the stomach.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
