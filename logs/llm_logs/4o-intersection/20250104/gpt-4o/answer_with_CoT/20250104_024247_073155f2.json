  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Aspirin is known to inhibit platelet aggregation by irreversibly inhibiting the cyclooxygenase enzyme, which leads to reduced production of thromboxane A2, a promoter of platelet aggregation. This results in platelet dysfunction, which can increase the risk of bleeding. Heparin is an anticoagulant that also increases bleeding risk by inhibiting clot formation. When both aspirin and heparin are used together, the risk of bleeding is significantly increased due to the combined effects on platelet function and coagulation pathways. Therefore, the primary reason aspirin is not given to a patient on heparin is due to the risk of platelet dysfunction leading to increased bleeding. There is no evidence that aspirin inhibits the action of heparin, enhances hypersensitivity to heparin, or affects the monitoring of heparin therapy. Thus, the most likely correct option is that aspirin causes platelet dysfunction.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
