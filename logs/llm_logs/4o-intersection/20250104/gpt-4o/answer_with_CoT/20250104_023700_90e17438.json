  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Aspirin is known to inhibit prostaglandins, which play a role in protecting the gastric mucosa. This inhibition can lead to an increased risk of gastric bleeding and exacerbate conditions like peptic ulcers. The antiplatelet effect of aspirin further increases the risk of bleeding, making it contraindicated in patients with peptic ulcers. While aspirin is used to manage fever, myalgia, and unstable angina due to its antipyretic, anti-inflammatory, and antiplatelet effects respectively, the risk of exacerbating a peptic ulcer is a well-established contraindication. Therefore, the most likely correct option is that aspirin is contraindicated in peptic ulcer.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
