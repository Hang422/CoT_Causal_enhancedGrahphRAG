It is more common with huminsulin\nopb. It may occur in the presence of infections\nopc. It may be due to antibodies to insulin\nopd. Use of glucocorticoids may be useful in severe cases\n\n### Reasoning Chains for Validation:\n- CHAIN: \"Huminsulin\" -> \"common insulin type\" -> \"no increased resistance\" -> 85%\n- CHAIN: \"Infection\" -> \"inflammatory response\" -> \"increased insulin resistance\" -> 95%\n- CHAIN: \"Antibodies to insulin\" -> \"bind to insulin\" -> \"reduced insulin effectiveness\" -> \"increased insulin resistance\" -> 90%\n- CHAIN: \"Glucocorticoids\" -> \"increased blood glucose\" -> \"worsened insulin resistance\" -> 95%\n\n### Retrieved Validation Paths:\n- (Inflammatory Response)-CAUSES->(Insulin Resistance)\n\n            ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n                \n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n            "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"To determine the incorrect statement regarding insulin resistance in diabetic patients, we evaluate each option based on standard medical knowledge. Insulin resistance is not specifically more common with 'huminsulin' (a type of human insulin), as insulin resistance is generally related to the body's response to insulin rather than the type of insulin used. Infections can lead to an inflammatory response, which is known to increase insulin resistance. Antibodies to insulin can bind to insulin, reducing its effectiveness and leading to increased insulin resistance. Glucocorticoids are known to increase blood glucose levels and can worsen insulin resistance, making their use counterproductive in managing insulin resistance. Therefore, the statement that glucocorticoids may be useful in severe cases of insulin resistance is incorrect. Based on this analysis, the most likely incorrect statement is that glucocorticoids may be useful in severe cases of insulin resistance.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
