Hypoglycemia\nopb. Cinchonism\nopc. Arrhythmias\nopd. Sweating\n\n### Reasoning Chains for Validation:\n- CHAIN: \"i.v. quinine\" -> \"increased insulin secretion\" -> \"decreased blood glucose\" -> \"hypoglycemia\" -> \"restlessness and sweating\" -> 85%\n- CHAIN: \"i.v. quinine\" -> \"cinchonism\" -> \"tinnitus, headache, dizziness\" -> \"restlessness\" -> 60%\n- CHAIN: \"i.v. quinine\" -> \"cardiac effects\" -> \"arrhythmias\" -> \"restlessness and sweating\" -> 50%\n- CHAIN: \"i.v. quinine\" -> \"direct stimulation of sweat glands\" -> \"sweating\" -> \"restlessness\" -> 40%\n\n### Retrieved Validation Paths:\n- (cardiac arrhythmia)-CAUSES->(Symptoms)-CAUSES->(Agitation)\n- (hypoglycemia)-CAUSES->(Agitation)\n- (Tinnitus)-CAUSES->(Symptoms)-CAUSES->(Agitation)\n- (cardiac arrhythmia)-CAUSES->(Disease)-CAUSES->(Agitation)\n- (cardiac arrhythmia)-CAUSES->(Hypertensive disease)-CAUSES->(Agitation)\n- (Headache)-CAUSES->(Disease)-CAUSES->(Agitation)\n- (Headache)-CAUSES->(End stage renal failure)-CAUSES->(Agitation)\n- (Headache)-CAUSES->(Hypertensive disease)-CAUSES->(Agitation)\n- (Dizziness)-CAUSES->(Disease)-CAUSES->(Agitation)\n\n            ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3.

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Quinine is known to cause hypoglycemia due to its ability to stimulate insulin secretion, which can lead to decreased blood glucose levels. The symptoms of hypoglycemia include restlessness and sweating, which align with the patient's presentation. While cinchonism, arrhythmias, and direct stimulation of sweat glands are potential side effects of quinine, the combination of restlessness and sweating is most directly explained by hypoglycemia. Therefore, the most likely cause of the patient's symptoms is hypoglycemia.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
