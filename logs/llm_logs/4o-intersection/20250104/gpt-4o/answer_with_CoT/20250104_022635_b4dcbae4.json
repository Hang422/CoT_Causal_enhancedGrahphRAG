Xylose\nopb. Mannose\nopc. Glucose\nopd. Ribose\n\n### Reasoning Chains for Validation:\n- CHAIN: \"Glucose\" -> \"active transport\" -> \"against concentration gradient\" -> \"SGLT1 transporter\" -> 95%\n- CHAIN: \"Xylose\" -> \"passive diffusion\" -> \"along concentration gradient\" -> \"no active transport\" -> 60%\n- CHAIN: \"Mannose\" -> \"passive diffusion\" -> \"along concentration gradient\" -> \"no active transport\" -> 60%\n- CHAIN: \"Ribose\" -> \"passive diffusion\" -> \"along concentration gradient\" -> \"no active transport\" -> 60%\n\n### Retrieved Validation Paths:\n- (Glucose)-CAUSES->(Biological Transport, Active)\n\n            ### Task:\n                1.

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The absorption of sugars in the intestine can occur via passive diffusion or active transport. Glucose is unique among the sugars listed because it is absorbed against its concentration gradient through active transport. This process is mediated by the sodium-glucose linked transporter 1 (SGLT1), which uses the energy from the sodium gradient to transport glucose into the intestinal cells. This mechanism allows glucose to be absorbed even when its concentration in the intestinal lumen is lower than in the cells. In contrast, xylose, mannose, and ribose are absorbed primarily through passive diffusion, which occurs along their concentration gradients and does not involve active transport. Therefore, based on standard physiological knowledge, glucose is the only sugar among the options that is absorbed against a concentration gradient.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opc\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
