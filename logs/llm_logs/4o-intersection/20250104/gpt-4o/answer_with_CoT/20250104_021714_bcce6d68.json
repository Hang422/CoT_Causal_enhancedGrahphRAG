  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"In the context of subarachnoid hemorrhage, the primary concern is the prevention of cerebral vasospasm, which can lead to delayed cerebral ischemia and worsen patient outcomes. Nimodipine is a calcium channel blocker that is specifically indicated for this purpose due to its ability to preferentially dilate cerebral blood vessels, thereby reducing the risk of vasospasm. While other calcium channel blockers like amlodipine, diltiazem, and verapamil also cause vasodilation, they are more systemic in their effects and are not specifically indicated for subarachnoid hemorrhage. The consensus in medical practice is that nimodipine is the drug of choice for this condition, as it has been shown to improve neurological outcomes in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage. Therefore, based on the available evidence and standard medical guidelines, nimodipine is the most appropriate choice.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
