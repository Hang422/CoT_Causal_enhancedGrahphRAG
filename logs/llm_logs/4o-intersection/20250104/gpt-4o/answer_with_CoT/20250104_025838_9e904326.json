Dexamethasone\nopb. Betamethasone\nopc. Hydrocoisone\nopd. Prednisolone\n\n### Reasoning Chains for Validation:\n- CHAIN: \"Congenital adrenal hyperplasia\" -> \"risk of virilization in female fetus\" -> \"need to suppress fetal adrenal androgen production\" -> \"Dexamethasone crosses placenta\" -> \"suppresses fetal adrenal gland\" -> 85%\n- CHAIN: \"Congenital adrenal hyperplasia\" -> \"21-hydroxylase deficiency\" -> \"excess androgen production\" -> \"Dexamethasone reduces androgen production\" -> \"prevents virilization\" -> 80%\n- CHAIN: \"Pregnant female\" -> \"fetal treatment needed\" -> \"Dexamethasone crosses placenta effectively\" -> \"direct fetal effect\" -> \"reduces androgen production\" -> 75%\n- CHAIN: \"Congenital adrenal hyperplasia\" -> \"fetal adrenal suppression required\" -> \"Dexamethasone used for fetal treatment\" -> \"effective in reducing virilization risk\" -> 70%\n\n### Retrieved Validation Paths:\n- (Dexamethasone)-TREATS->(Virilism)\n- (Visual Suppression)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(CACNA1A)-PART_OF->(Cells)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Dexamethasone)\n- (Visual Suppression)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(CACNA1A)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Genes)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Dexamethasone)\n\n            ### Task:\n                1.

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) is often due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency, leading to excess androgen production, which can cause virilization in a female fetus. The goal in treating a pregnant woman suspected of carrying a fetus with CAH is to suppress fetal adrenal androgen production. Dexamethasone is the drug of choice because it effectively crosses the placenta and suppresses the fetal adrenal gland, thereby reducing androgen production and preventing virilization. Other corticosteroids like betamethasone, hydrocortisone, and prednisolone are not as effective in crossing the placenta or in directly affecting the fetus in this context. Therefore, based on standard medical knowledge and consensus, dexamethasone is the most appropriate choice.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
