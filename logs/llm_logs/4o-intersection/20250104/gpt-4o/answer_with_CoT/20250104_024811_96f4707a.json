  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Tamoxifen is a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) used in the treatment of estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer. It is known to have several adverse effects. Thromboembolism is a well-documented risk associated with tamoxifen use due to its estrogenic effects on the coagulation system. Similarly, tamoxifen increases the risk of endometrial carcinoma because of its partial agonist effect on the endometrium. Cataracts are also a recognized adverse effect of tamoxifen, likely due to its impact on lens proteins. However, tamoxifen is generally considered to have a protective effect against the development of new breast cancer in the contralateral breast, rather than causing it. Therefore, the adverse effect that tamoxifen does not cause is carcinoma in the contralateral breast.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opc\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}\n```",
