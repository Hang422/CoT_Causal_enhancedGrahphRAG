  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Progesterone is a hormone primarily produced in the ovary after ovulation. The process begins with the transformation of a mature follicle into the corpus luteum following ovulation. The corpus luteum, which is formed from the remnants of the ovulated follicle, is the primary structure responsible for the production of progesterone. Luteal cells within the corpus luteum synthesize and secrete progesterone, which is crucial for maintaining the uterine lining and supporting early pregnancy. The stroma of the ovary serves as supportive tissue and is not a primary source of hormone production. The corpora albicans is the degenerated form of the corpus luteum and does not produce significant amounts of hormones. Therefore, the most likely correct answer, based on standard medical knowledge, is that progesterone production in the ovary is primarily by the corpora lutea.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opc\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
