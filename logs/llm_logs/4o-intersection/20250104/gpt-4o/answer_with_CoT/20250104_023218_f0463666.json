Increase in glucagon/insulin ratio, increased CAMP and increased blood glucose\nopb. Decreased insulin, increased free fatty acid which is equivalent to blood glucose\nopc. Decreased insulin, increased free fatty acid which is not equivalent to blood glucose\nopd. Elevated insulin and free fatty acid, equivalent to blood glucose\n\n### Reasoning Chains for Validation:\n- CHAIN: \"Decreased insulin\" -> \"Increased glucagon/insulin ratio\" -> \"Increased cAMP\" -> \"Increased blood glucose\" -> 90%\n- CHAIN: \"Decreased insulin\" -> \"Increased free fatty acid\" -> \"Not equivalent to blood glucose\" -> 80%\n- CHAIN: \"Decreased insulin\" -> \"Increased free fatty acid\" -> \"Equivalent to blood glucose\" -> 60%\n- CHAIN: \"Elevated insulin\" -> \"Increased free fatty acid\" -> \"Equivalent to blood glucose\" -> 50%\n\n### Retrieved Validation Paths:\n- (Fatty Acids, Nonesterified)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Blood Glucose)\n\n            ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n                \n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n            "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"In diabetic ketoacidosis, the primary issue is a lack of insulin, which leads to an increased glucagon/insulin ratio. This imbalance results in increased cAMP levels, promoting gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis, thereby increasing blood glucose levels. Additionally, the lack of insulin allows for increased lipolysis, leading to elevated free fatty acids, which are converted to ketone bodies, causing ketoacidosis. The key feature distinguishing diabetic ketoacidosis from starvation-induced ketoacidosis is the significantly elevated blood glucose levels due to the lack of insulin. Therefore, the option that best describes diabetic ketoacidosis is the one that includes an increased glucagon/insulin ratio, increased cAMP, and increased blood glucose.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}\n```",
