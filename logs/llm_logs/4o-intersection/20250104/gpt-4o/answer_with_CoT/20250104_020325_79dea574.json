Which of the following enzymes is defective?\n\n            ### Options\n            opa. Fructokinase\nopb. Aldolase A\nopc. Aldolase B\nopd. Sucrase\n\n### Reasoning Chains for Validation:\n- CHAIN: \"Weaning with fruit juice\" -> \"Fructose intake\" -> \"Fructose metabolism required\" -> \"Aldolase B needed\" -> \"Aldolase B deficiency\" -> \"Accumulation of toxic metabolites\" -> \"Vomiting, lethargy, severe jaundice\" -> 95%\n- CHAIN: \"Weaning with fruit juice\" -> \"Fructose intake\" -> \"Fructose metabolism required\" -> \"Fructokinase needed\" -> \"Fructokinase deficiency\" -> \"Possible mild symptoms\" -> \"Unlikely severe jaundice\" -> 40%\n- CHAIN: \"Weaning with fruit juice\" -> \"Fructose intake\" -> \"Fructose metabolism required\" -> \"Aldolase A needed\" -> \"Aldolase A deficiency\" -> \"Unlikely related to fructose metabolism\" -> \"Unlikely severe jaundice\" -> 30%\n- CHAIN: \"Weaning with fruit juice\" -> \"Fructose intake\" -> \"Fructose metabolism required\" -> \"Sucrase not involved\" -> \"Unrelated to symptoms\" -> 20%\n\n### Retrieved Validation Paths:\n- (FRUCTOKINASE)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cells)-LOCATION_OF->(Fructose)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Deficiency of fructokinase)\n- (FRUCTOKINASE)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cells)-INTERACTS_WITH->(mutant gene)-CAUSES->(Deficiency of fructokinase)\n\n            ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3.

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The symptoms presented by the 6-month-old baby, including vomiting, lethargy, and severe jaundice upon weaning with fruit juice, suggest a problem with fructose metabolism. Fruit juice contains fructose, and the metabolism of fructose involves several enzymes. The key enzymes in fructose metabolism are fructokinase, aldolase B, and others. Fructokinase deficiency leads to essential fructosuria, which is generally benign and does not cause severe symptoms like jaundice. Aldolase A is primarily involved in glycolysis and is not directly related to fructose metabolism. Sucrase is involved in the digestion of sucrose, not fructose. Aldolase B is crucial for the breakdown of fructose-1-phosphate in the liver. A deficiency in aldolase B leads to hereditary fructose intolerance, which can cause severe symptoms such as vomiting, lethargy, and jaundice due to the accumulation of toxic metabolites. Therefore, the most likely enzyme deficiency in this scenario is aldolase B.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opc\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
