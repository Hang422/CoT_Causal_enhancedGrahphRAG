Vitamin A\nopb. Vitamin C\nopc. Vitamin D\nopd. Vitamin B12\n\n### Reasoning Chains for Validation:\n- CHAIN: \"Vitamin D\" -> \"improved insulin sensitivity\" -> \"reduced insulin resistance\" -> \"decreased risk of obesity\" -> \"lowered risk of metabolic syndrome\" -> 85%\n- CHAIN: \"Vitamin A\" -> \"antioxidant properties\" -> \"possible reduction in oxidative stress\" -> \"unclear impact on insulin resistance\" -> 50%\n- CHAIN: \"Vitamin C\" -> \"antioxidant properties\" -> \"possible reduction in inflammation\" -> \"unclear impact on insulin resistance\" -> 50%\n- CHAIN: \"Vitamin B12\" -> \"role in energy metabolism\" -> \"possible impact on weight management\" -> \"unclear impact on insulin resistance\" -> 50%\n\n### Retrieved Validation Paths:\n- (Vitamin D2)-TREATS->(Obesity)-CAUSES->(insulin sensitivity)\n- (Vitamin D2)-PREDISPOSES->(Disease)-CAUSES->(insulin sensitivity)\n- (Vitamin D2)-CAUSES->(Hypertensive disease)-PREDISPOSES->(insulin sensitivity)\n- (Vitamin B 12)-TREATS->(Obesity)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Energy Metabolism)\n- (Vitamin B 12)-TREATS->(Autoimmune Diseases)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Energy Metabolism)\n- (Vitamin B 12)-TREATS->(Heart failure)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Energy Metabolism)\n- (Insulin Resistance)-CAUSES->(Obesity)\n\n            ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n                \n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n            "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Vitamin D is known to play a significant role in improving insulin sensitivity and reducing insulin resistance. This is supported by various studies that suggest a link between adequate levels of Vitamin D and a decreased risk of developing obesity and metabolic syndrome. Vitamin D's role in calcium homeostasis and its potential anti-inflammatory effects may contribute to these benefits. In contrast, while Vitamins A, C, and B12 have important roles in the body, their direct impact on insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome is less clear and not as well-supported by current evidence. Therefore, based on the available data and medical consensus, Vitamin D is the most likely candidate to reduce the risk of insulin resistance, obesity, and metabolic syndrome.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opc\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
