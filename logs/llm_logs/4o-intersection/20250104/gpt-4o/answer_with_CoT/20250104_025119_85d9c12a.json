Increases liver glycogenolysis\nopb. Causes broachiolar constriction\nopc. Evokes extrasystoles in the heart\nopd. Produces restlessness and anxiety\n\n### Reasoning Chains for Validation:\n- CHAIN: \"Epinephrine\" -> \"increased liver glycogenolysis\" -> \"increased blood glucose\" -> 95%\n- CHAIN: \"Epinephrine\" -> \"bronchiolar constriction\" -> \"possible conflict with bronchodilation\" -> 60%\n- CHAIN: \"Epinephrine\" -> \"evokes extrasystoles in the heart\" -> \"increased heart rate\" -> 90%\n- CHAIN: \"Epinephrine\" -> \"produces restlessness and anxiety\" -> \"increased sympathetic activity\" -> 85%\n\n### Retrieved Validation Paths:\n- (Epinephrine)-CAUSES->(Disease)-PREDISPOSES->(Anxiety)\n- (Epinephrine)-CAUSES->(Hypertensive disease)-PREDISPOSES->(Anxiety)\n\n            ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3.

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Epinephrine, also known as adrenaline, is a hormone and medication that is part of the body's fight-or-flight response. It is known to increase liver glycogenolysis, leading to increased blood glucose levels, which aligns with option opa. Epinephrine is also known to cause cardiac effects such as extrasystoles due to its action on beta-1 adrenergic receptors, supporting option opc. It can produce restlessness and anxiety due to increased sympathetic nervous system activity, supporting option opd. However, epinephrine typically causes bronchodilation rather than bronchiolar constriction due to its action on beta-2 adrenergic receptors in the lungs. Therefore, option opb, which states that epinephrine causes bronchiolar constriction, is not consistent with the known pharmacological actions of epinephrine.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
