  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Pimozide is an antipsychotic medication primarily used for the treatment of Tourette's syndrome. It is structurally related to the diphenyl butyl piperidine class of antipsychotics. While it shares some pharmacological properties with other antipsychotic classes, such as butyrophenones, its chemical structure and classification align with diphenyl butyl piperidines. The reasoning chains and validation paths support this classification, and there is a consensus in pharmacological literature that pimozide belongs to the diphenyl butyl piperidine class.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
