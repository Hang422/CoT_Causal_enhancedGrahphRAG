This hormone is produced in which one of the following anatomical locations?\n\n            ### Options\n            opa. Hypothalamus\nopb. Anterior pituitary\nopc. Posterior pituitary\nopd. Adrenal cortex\n\n### Reasoning Chains for Validation:\n- CHAIN: \"Oxytocin\" -> \"produced in hypothalamus\" -> \"transported to posterior pituitary\" -> \"released into bloodstream\" -> \"causes uterine contractions\" -> 95%\n- CHAIN: \"Oxytocin\" -> \"produced in hypothalamus\" -> \"stored in posterior pituitary\" -> \"released during labor\" -> \"induces uterine contractions\" -> 90%\n- CHAIN: \"Oxytocin\" -> \"synthesized in hypothalamus\" -> \"moved to posterior pituitary\" -> \"released into circulation\" -> \"stimulates uterine contractions\" -> 92%\n- CHAIN: \"Oxytocin\" -> \"originates in hypothalamus\" -> \"stored and released by posterior pituitary\" -> \"triggers uterine contractions\" -> 93%\n\n### Retrieved Validation Paths:\n- (Oxytocin)-CAUSES->(Energy Metabolism)-PROCESS_OF->(Hypothalamic structure)\n- (Oxytocin)-CAUSES->(Excretory function)-PROCESS_OF->(Hypothalamic structure)\n- (Oxytocin)-CAUSES->(Prostaglandin Production)-PROCESS_OF->(Hypothalamic structure)\n- (Hypothalamic structure)-PART_OF->(Pituitary Gland, Posterior)\n\n            ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n                \n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n            "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The hormone responsible for causing uterine contractions during labor is oxytocin. Oxytocin is synthesized in the hypothalamus and then transported to the posterior pituitary gland, where it is stored and later released into the bloodstream. This release triggers uterine contractions. The anatomical location where oxytocin is produced is the hypothalamus, although it is stored and released by the posterior pituitary. The consensus in medical literature supports that the production site is the hypothalamus.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
