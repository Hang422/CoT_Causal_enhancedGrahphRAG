  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Cholecystokinin (CCK) is a hormone that plays a significant role in digestion. It is well-established that CCK stimulates the contraction of the gallbladder, which releases bile into the small intestine, aiding in the digestion of fats. This action is widely recognized and supported by medical literature. Additionally, CCK stimulates the pancreas to secrete pancreatic juice that is rich in digestive enzymes, which further supports the digestion of nutrients. These two actions are the primary and well-documented effects of CCK. The effect of CCK on enterokinase secretion is not well-documented or widely recognized in standard medical texts, making it less likely to be a primary action of CCK. Therefore, the most likely correct answer, based on consensus and standard medical knowledge, is that CCK is responsible for both the contraction of the gallbladder and the secretion of enzyme-rich pancreatic juice. Thus, the best-supported option is 'All', as it encompasses the two well-established actions of CCK.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
