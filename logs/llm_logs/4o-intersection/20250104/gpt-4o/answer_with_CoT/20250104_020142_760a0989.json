Aldosterone\nopb. DOCA\nopc. Fludrocoeisone\nopd. Triamcinolone\n\n### Reasoning Chains for Validation:\n- CHAIN: \"Aldosterone\" -> \"strong sodium retention\" -> \"increased blood volume\" -> \"potent mineralocorticoid effect\" -> 95%\n- CHAIN: \"DOCA\" -> \"moderate sodium retention\" -> \"increased blood volume\" -> \"less potent than aldosterone\" -> 70%\n- CHAIN: \"Fludrocortisone\" -> \"strong sodium retention\" -> \"increased blood volume\" -> \"potent mineralocorticoid effect\" -> 85%\n- CHAIN: \"Triamcinolone\" -> \"minimal mineralocorticoid activity\" -> \"weak sodium retention\" -> \"not potent mineralocorticoid\" -> 60%\n\n### Retrieved Validation Paths:\n- (Aldosterone)-CAUSES->(Hypernatremia)\n- (Desoxycorticosterone acetate)-CAUSES->(Hypernatremia)\n\n            ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n                \n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n            "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Mineralocorticoids are hormones that regulate sodium and water balance in the body. Aldosterone is the primary endogenous mineralocorticoid produced by the adrenal cortex and is known for its potent effects on sodium retention and potassium excretion, leading to increased blood volume and blood pressure. Fludrocortisone is a synthetic corticosteroid with strong mineralocorticoid activity, often used in clinical settings to mimic aldosterone's effects. While both aldosterone and fludrocortisone have strong mineralocorticoid effects, fludrocortisone is often considered more potent in terms of its mineralocorticoid activity when used therapeutically. DOCA (Desoxycorticosterone acetate) has mineralocorticoid activity but is generally less potent than aldosterone. Triamcinolone is primarily a glucocorticoid with minimal mineralocorticoid activity. Based on the consensus in pharmacology, fludrocortisone is often considered the most potent mineralocorticoid when comparing its effects in therapeutic contexts.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opc\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}\n```",
