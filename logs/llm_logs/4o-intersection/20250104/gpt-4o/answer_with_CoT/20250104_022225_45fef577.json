  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"To determine which drug is not used for anxiety, we evaluate each option based on their primary pharmacological use. Propranolol is a beta-blocker often used off-label for anxiety, particularly for performance anxiety, due to its ability to mitigate physical symptoms like tachycardia. Alprazolam is a benzodiazepine, a class of drugs commonly prescribed for anxiety disorders due to their anxiolytic effects. Buspirone is an anxiolytic specifically indicated for the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder. Haloperidol, on the other hand, is a typical antipsychotic primarily used for the treatment of schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders. It is not typically used for anxiety, as its primary mechanism and indications do not align with anxiety treatment. Therefore, based on standard medical knowledge, haloperidol is the drug not used for anxiety.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}\n```",
