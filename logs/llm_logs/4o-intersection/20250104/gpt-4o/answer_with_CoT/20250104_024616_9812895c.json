Amyloidosis associated with multiple myeloma has the poorest prognosis\nopb. Fine - needle biopsy of subcutaneous abdominal fat is a simple & reliable method for diagnosing secondary systemic amyloidosis\nopc. Hepatic amyloid disease produces hepatomegaly but rarely jaundice\nopd. Amyloidosis of the spleen is associated with severe anemia\n\n### Reasoning Chains for Validation:\n- CHAIN: \"Multiple myeloma\" -> \"associated with AL amyloidosis\" -> \"poor prognosis\" -> 80%\n- CHAIN: \"Subcutaneous abdominal fat biopsy\" -> \"simple method\" -> \"reliable for diagnosing secondary systemic amyloidosis\" -> 85%\n- CHAIN: \"Hepatic amyloid disease\" -> \"hepatomegaly\" -> \"rarely jaundice\" -> 90%\n- CHAIN: \"Amyloidosis of the spleen\" -> \"splenic involvement\" -> \"possible anemia\" -> \"severe anemia unclear\" -> 60%\n\n### Retrieved Validation Paths:\n- (Spleen)-LOCATION_OF->(Anemia)\n- (Amyloidosis)-CAUSES->(Disease)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Respiration)-PROCESS_OF->(Spleen)\n\n            ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n                \n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n            "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Amyloidosis associated with multiple myeloma is known as AL amyloidosis, which indeed has a poor prognosis due to the underlying plasma cell dyscrasia, supporting option opa as true. Fine-needle biopsy of subcutaneous abdominal fat is a well-established, simple, and reliable method for diagnosing systemic amyloidosis, including secondary types, making option opb true. Hepatic amyloid disease typically causes hepatomegaly, and jaundice is rare, confirming option opc as true. Amyloidosis of the spleen can lead to splenic enlargement and potentially anemia due to hypersplenism, but severe anemia is not a typical or direct association, making option opd the least supported by standard medical knowledge. Therefore, the statement that amyloidosis of the spleen is associated with severe anemia is the most likely incorrect statement.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
