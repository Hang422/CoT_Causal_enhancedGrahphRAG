Selenium\nopb. Phosphorus\nopc. Boron\nopd. Zinc\n\n### Retrieved Similar Medical Knowledge:\n- Glucocorticoids TREATS Myocardial Ischemia\n- Hyperparathyroidism CAUSES Cardiomyopathies\n- Calcinosis CAUSES Cardiac Arrhythmia\n- CD4/CD8 ratio procedure DIAGNOSES Granuloma\n- Serum selenium DIAGNOSES Nonobstructive cardiomyopathy\n- Epidural Anesthesia TREATS Lumbosacral nerve root pain\n- SERPINB1 ASSOCIATED_WITH Alzheimer's Disease\n- Serum Phosphorus Level PREDISPOSES Left ventricular diastolic dysfunction\n- Becker Muscular Dystrophy CAUSES Cardiomyopathy, Dilated\n- Trace element deficiency CAUSES Cardiomyopathies\n- Suction drain PREVENTS Hematoma\n\n    ### Instructions:\n            - Use standard medical knowledge as the primary guide.\n            - Consider enhanced information only if it aligns with consensus.\n            - If conflicting or unclear, present the most likely correct answer based on known facts.\n            - It's acceptable to show moderate confidence if the question is complex, but still choose one best answer.\n    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3.

  "response": "```json\n{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Cardiomyopathy can be caused by deficiencies in certain trace elements. Among the options provided, selenium deficiency is known to be associated with cardiomyopathy, specifically a condition known as Keshan disease, which is a type of cardiomyopathy linked to low selenium levels. The retrieved knowledge mentions that serum selenium is used to diagnose nonobstructive cardiomyopathy, supporting the link between selenium deficiency and cardiomyopathy. Other options like phosphorus, boron, and zinc are not commonly associated with cardiomyopathy due to deficiency.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opa\",\n    \"confidence\": 90\n}\n```",
