  "response": "```json\n{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Menke's Kinky hair syndrome, also known as Menkes disease, is a genetic disorder that affects copper levels in the body. It is caused by a defect in the ATP7A gene, which is responsible for the transport of copper. This defect leads to poor distribution of copper in the body, affecting the development of hair, brain, and other tissues. Therefore, the defect is in the copper (Cu) transporter.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opb\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
