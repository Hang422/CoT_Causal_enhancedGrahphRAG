  "response": "```json\n{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Sertoli cells, located in the seminiferous tubules of the testes, are known to secrete androgen-binding protein (ABP). This protein binds to testosterone, concentrating it in the seminiferous tubules and facilitating spermatogenesis. The other options, testosterone, LH, and FSH, are not secreted by Sertoli cells. Testosterone is produced by Leydig cells, while LH and FSH are hormones secreted by the anterior pituitary gland. Therefore, the most likely correct answer is that Sertoli cells secrete androgen-binding protein.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opa\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
