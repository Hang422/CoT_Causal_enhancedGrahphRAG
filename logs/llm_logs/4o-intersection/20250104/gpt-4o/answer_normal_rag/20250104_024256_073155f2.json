  "response": "```json\n{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Aspirin is known to cause platelet dysfunction by irreversibly inhibiting the enzyme cyclooxygenase, which leads to decreased production of thromboxane A2, a promoter of platelet aggregation. This effect can increase the risk of bleeding, especially in patients who are also on anticoagulant therapy such as heparin. Therefore, the primary concern with using aspirin in a patient already on heparin is the increased risk of bleeding due to platelet dysfunction. The other options do not accurately describe the interaction between aspirin and heparin.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opa\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
