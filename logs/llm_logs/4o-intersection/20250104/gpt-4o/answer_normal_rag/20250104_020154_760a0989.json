  "response": "```json\n{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Aldosterone is the most potent naturally occurring mineralocorticoid in the human body. It plays a crucial role in regulating sodium and potassium balance and blood pressure. While Fludrocortisone is a synthetic mineralocorticoid with potent activity, Aldosterone is considered the most potent endogenous mineralocorticoid. DOCA (Deoxycorticosterone acetate) and Triamcinolone are less potent in terms of mineralocorticoid activity, with Triamcinolone primarily being a glucocorticoid. Therefore, based on standard medical knowledge, Aldosterone is the most potent mineralocorticoid.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opa\",\n    \"confidence\": 90\n}\n```",
