  "response": "```json\n{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Pethidine (also known as meperidine) is contraindicated in renal failure due to the accumulation of its metabolite, normeperidine, which can cause central nervous system toxicity, including seizures. Morphine and its metabolites can also accumulate in renal failure, but it is not as strongly contraindicated as pethidine. Fentanyl is generally considered safer in renal impairment because it has no active metabolites. Atracurium is a neuromuscular blocker that is metabolized by Hofmann elimination and ester hydrolysis, processes that are independent of renal function, making it safe in renal failure.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opa\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
