  "response": "```json\n{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"The renal system is responsible for producing several important peptides and hormones. Renin is an enzyme produced by the kidneys that plays a crucial role in the renin-angiotensin system, which regulates blood pressure. Angiotensin I is a peptide that is formed from angiotensinogen by the action of renin, but it is not directly produced by the kidneys; it is converted to angiotensin I in the bloodstream. Erythropoietin is a hormone produced by the kidneys that stimulates red blood cell production. 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol (1,25DHCC), also known as calcitriol, is the active form of vitamin D, which is produced in the kidneys. Therefore, the peptide not directly produced by the renal system is Angiotensin I, as it is formed in the bloodstream from angiotensinogen, which is produced by the liver.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opb\",\n    \"confidence\": 90\n}\n```",
