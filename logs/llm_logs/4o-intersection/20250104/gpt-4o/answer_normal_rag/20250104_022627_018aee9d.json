  "response": "```json\n{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Plasmin is primarily known for its role in fibrinolysis, where it breaks down fibrin clots. It also has a role in activating collagenase, which is involved in the breakdown of collagen. However, plasmin does not stabilize fibrin; rather, it degrades it. The destruction of von Willebrand factor (VWF) is not a recognized function of plasmin. Therefore, the option that does not align with the known functions of plasmin is 'Stabilization of fibrin'.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opd\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
