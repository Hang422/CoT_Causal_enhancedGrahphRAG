  "response": "```json\n{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"The symptoms described in the question, such as diminished night vision, dryness of eyes, and the presence of white triangular plaques on the conjunctiva (known as Bitot's spots), are classic signs of Vitamin A deficiency. Vitamin A is crucial for maintaining healthy vision, particularly in low-light conditions, and for maintaining the integrity of epithelial tissues, including those in the eyes. The history of recurrent bacterial infections can also be linked to Vitamin A deficiency, as it plays a role in immune function. The retrieved medical knowledge supports that Vitamin A deficiency causes eye diseases, which aligns with the symptoms presented in the question.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opc\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
