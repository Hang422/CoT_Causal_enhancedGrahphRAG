  "response": "```json\n{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"CAMP, or cyclic adenosine monophosphate, is a well-known secondary messenger in cellular signaling pathways. It primarily acts by activating protein kinase A (PKA), which then phosphorylates various target proteins to elicit cellular responses. This mechanism is a fundamental aspect of CAMP's role in signal transduction. While adenylate cyclase is involved in the production of CAMP, it is not the direct action of CAMP itself. Ca2+ release is typically associated with other signaling pathways, such as those involving inositol phosphates. Therefore, the most direct action of CAMP is through the activation of protein kinase.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opa\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
