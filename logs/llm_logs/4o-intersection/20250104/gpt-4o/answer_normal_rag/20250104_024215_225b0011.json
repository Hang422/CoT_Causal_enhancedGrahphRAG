  "response": "```json\n{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Triamterene is a potassium-sparing diuretic, which means it helps the body retain potassium while promoting the excretion of sodium and water. This mechanism of action makes it unlikely to cause hypokalemia (low potassium levels), which is a common side effect of other types of diuretics. Instead, triamterene can lead to hyperkalemia (high potassium levels). Muscle cramps can be associated with electrolyte imbalances, including those involving potassium. Therefore, among the given options, muscle cramps are a plausible side effect of triamterene due to potential electrolyte disturbances.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opb\",\n    \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
