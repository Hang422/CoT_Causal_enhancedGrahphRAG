Which of the following enzymes is defective?\n\n    Options:\n    opa. Fructokinase\nopb. Aldolase A\nopc. Aldolase B\nopd. Sucrase\n\n### Retrieved Similar Medical Knowledge:\n- Enzymes ASSOCIATED_WITH Neonatal Jaundice\n- Enzymes CAUSES Malnutrition\n- Enterocytes INTERACTS_WITH Antibodies\n- Serine TREATS Micrococcus luteus\n- Enzymopathy PREDISPOSES Neonatal Jaundice\n- Enzymes CAUSES Neonatal hypoglycemia\n- Cell Line LOCATION_OF Epipodophyllotoxin\n\n    ### Instructions:\n            - Use standard medical knowledge as the primary guide.\n            - Consider enhanced information only if it aligns with consensus.\n            - If conflicting or unclear, present the most likely correct answer based on known facts.\n            - It's acceptable to show moderate confidence if the question is complex, but still choose one best answer.\n    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3.

  "response": "```json\n{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"The symptoms presented by the 6-month-old baby, including vomiting, lethargy, and severe jaundice upon introduction of fruit juice, are indicative of hereditary fructose intolerance (HFI). This condition is caused by a deficiency in the enzyme Aldolase B. When fructose is ingested, it cannot be properly metabolized, leading to the accumulation of toxic metabolites that cause the symptoms observed. Aldolase B is responsible for the breakdown of fructose-1-phosphate in the liver, and its deficiency leads to the clinical presentation described.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opc\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
