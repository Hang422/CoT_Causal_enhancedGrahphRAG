  "response": "```json\n{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Herpes simplex encephalitis is typically treated with antiviral agents. Acyclovir is the first-line treatment for herpes simplex encephalitis. Vidarabine is an older antiviral that was used before acyclovir became the standard. Ganciclovir is another antiviral that is used for cytomegalovirus infections but can also be used in some cases of herpes infections. Amantadine, however, is an antiviral used primarily for influenza A and has no role in the treatment of herpes simplex encephalitis. Therefore, the drug that is not used for herpes simplex encephalitis is Amantadine.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opd\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
