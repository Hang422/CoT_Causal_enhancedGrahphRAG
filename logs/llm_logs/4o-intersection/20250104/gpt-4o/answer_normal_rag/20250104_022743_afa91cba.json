  "response": "```json\n{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Aldosterone primarily acts on the distal parts of the nephron, specifically the collecting duct and the distal convoluted tubule, to promote sodium reabsorption and potassium excretion. This action is crucial for regulating blood pressure and electrolyte balance. The retrieved knowledge mentions aldosterone's association with renal tubular disorders, which aligns with its action in the collecting duct. The other options, such as the glomerulus, proximal convoluted tubule, and loop of Henle, are not the primary sites of aldosterone action.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opa\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
