  "response": "```json\n{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Cisplatin is well-known to cause ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity as common side effects. The 'coasting effect' is a term often used to describe the delayed onset of peripheral neuropathy associated with cisplatin. Pulmonary fibrosis, however, is not typically associated with cisplatin but rather with other cytotoxic agents like bleomycin. Therefore, the side effect not produced by cisplatin is pulmonary fibrosis.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opd\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
