  "response": "```json\n{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Propranolol is a non-selective beta-blocker that is commonly used to treat conditions such as thyrotoxicosis, essential tremor, and hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM). It is also used in the management of atrial flutter, although not as a first-line treatment. However, propranolol is not typically used for Parkinsonian tremor, as this type of tremor is more effectively managed with medications like levodopa or anticholinergics. The retrieved knowledge supports the use of propranolol in thyrotoxicosis and tremor, but not specifically in Parkinsonian tremor.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opb\",\n    \"confidence\": 90\n}\n```",
