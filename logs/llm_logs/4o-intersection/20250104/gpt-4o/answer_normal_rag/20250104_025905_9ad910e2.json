  "response": "```json\n{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"The respiratory center is primarily located in the brainstem, specifically in the medulla oblongata and pons, not the midbrain. It is not directly stimulated by a fall in PaO2; rather, it is more sensitive to changes in PaCO2 and pH levels. The respiratory center is connected with the cardiac center as both are part of the autonomic nervous system and are located in the brainstem, allowing for coordination between respiratory and cardiovascular functions. Additionally, the respiratory center is inhibited during swallowing to prevent aspiration, which is a protective reflex. Therefore, the most accurate statement is that the respiratory center is inhibited during swallowing.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opc\",\n    \"confidence\": 90\n}\n```",
