Leucine\nopb. Lysine\nopc. Methionine\nopd. Proline\n\n### Retrieved Similar Medical Knowledge:\n- Digests ASSOCIATED_WITH Lysine\n- Adenovirus Infections CAUSES Liver damage\n- Muscle LOCATION_OF Adeno-associated virus 3\n- Penicillin prophylaxis TREATS Polyarteritis Nodosa\n- Negative Regulation of Coagulation ASSOCIATED_WITH Amino Acids\n- Choroid LOCATION_OF Laser-Doppler Flowmetry\n- Cranial and facial bones LOCATION_OF Screw\n- Endothelial Cells LOCATION_OF Virulent strain\n\n    ### Instructions:\n            - Use standard medical knowledge as the primary guide.\n            - Consider enhanced information only if it aligns with consensus.\n            - If conflicting or unclear, present the most likely correct answer based on known facts.\n            - It's acceptable to show moderate confidence if the question is complex, but still choose one best answer.\n    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3.

Leucine, lysine, and methionine are all essential amino acids. Proline, however, is a non-essential amino acid because the body can synthesize it. Therefore, the correct answer is that proline is not an essential amino acid.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opd\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
