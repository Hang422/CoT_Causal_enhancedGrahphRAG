  "response": "```json\n{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Dobutamine is a synthetic catecholamine that primarily acts as a beta-1 adrenergic agonist, which makes it an effective inotropic agent for increasing cardiac output. Unlike dopamine, dobutamine does not activate peripheral dopaminergic receptors, which are responsible for renal and mesenteric vasodilation. Dopamine, on the other hand, can activate these dopaminergic receptors at lower doses. Therefore, the key difference between dobutamine and dopamine is that dobutamine does not activate peripheral dopaminergic receptors.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opd\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
