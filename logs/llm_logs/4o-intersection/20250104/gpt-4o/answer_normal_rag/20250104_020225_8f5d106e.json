  "response": "```json\n{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Folic acid metabolism can be inhibited by several agents. Methotrexate is a well-known inhibitor of dihydrofolate reductase, an enzyme critical in folic acid metabolism. Trimethoprim also inhibits dihydrofolate reductase, albeit less potently than methotrexate. Sulfonamides inhibit the synthesis of folic acid in bacteria by competing with para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA), but they do not directly inhibit folic acid metabolism in humans. Nitrous oxide can inactivate vitamin B12, which indirectly affects folate metabolism. 5-Flucytosine does not have a direct role in inhibiting folic acid metabolism. Therefore, the most likely correct options are b) Methotrexate and d) Trimethoprim, making option 'opb. abd' the best choice.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opb\",\n    \"confidence\": 90\n}\n```",
