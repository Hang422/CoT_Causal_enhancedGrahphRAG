This condition is characterized by the accumulation of remnants of chylomicrons and VLDL due to defective clearance. The pathophysiology is primarily due to Apo E deficiency, which is crucial for the normal catabolism of triglyceride-rich lipoprotein constituents. Apo E is necessary for the binding of these remnants to hepatic receptors, and its deficiency leads to their accumulation, causing the symptoms described.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opd\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
