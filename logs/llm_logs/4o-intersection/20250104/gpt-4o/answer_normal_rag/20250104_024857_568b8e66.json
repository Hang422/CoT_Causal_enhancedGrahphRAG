While ibuprofen is noted to prevent gastric irritation in some contexts, acetaminophen is generally considered to have the least gastric irritation among the options provided, as it primarily acts as an analgesic and antipyretic without significant anti-inflammatory effects that contribute to gastric irritation.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opb\",\n    \"confidence\": 90\n}\n```",
