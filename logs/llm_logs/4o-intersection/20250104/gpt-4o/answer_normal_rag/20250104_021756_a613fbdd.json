  "response": "```json\n{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Enzymatic markers of the plasma membrane are typically enzymes that are integral to or associated with the plasma membrane. 5'-nucleotidase, adenylyl cyclase, and Na+-K+-ATPase are well-known enzymes associated with the plasma membrane. Galactosyl transferase, however, is primarily associated with the Golgi apparatus, where it plays a role in glycosylation processes. Therefore, it is not considered a marker of the plasma membrane.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opd\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
