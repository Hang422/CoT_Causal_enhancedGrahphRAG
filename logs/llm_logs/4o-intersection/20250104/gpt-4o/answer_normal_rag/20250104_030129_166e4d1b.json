It is not typically used for rheumatoid arthritis or infectious mononucleosis. The retrieved knowledge does not directly support chloroquine's use in infectious mononucleosis, and while it mentions chloroquine treating virus diseases, this is not specific to infectious mononucleosis. Therefore, the most supported use of chloroquine among the options provided is for discoid lupus erythematosus.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opa\",\n    \"confidence\": 90\n}\n```",
