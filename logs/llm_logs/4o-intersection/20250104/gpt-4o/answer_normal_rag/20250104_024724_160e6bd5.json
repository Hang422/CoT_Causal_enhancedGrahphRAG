  "response": "```json\n{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Antidiuretic hormone (ADH), also known as vasopressin, is primarily secreted in response to increased plasma osmolarity and decreased blood volume (hypovolemia). Hypovolemia triggers the release of ADH to promote water reabsorption in the kidneys, thereby increasing blood volume and pressure. Hypervolemia and decreased osmolarity would typically suppress ADH secretion. Therefore, hypovolemia is the condition that results in an increase in ADH secretion.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opc\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
