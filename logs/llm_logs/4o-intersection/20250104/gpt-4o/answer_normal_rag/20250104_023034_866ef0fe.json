It is more common with huminsulin\nopb. It may occur in the presence of infections\nopc. It may be due to antibodies to insulin\nopd. Use of glucocorticoids may be useful in severe cases\n\n### Retrieved Similar Medical Knowledge:\n- Candida lipolytica LOCATION_OF Enzymes\n- Insulin Resistance ASSOCIATED_WITH Insulin\n- Leptin|LEP ASSOCIATED_WITH Infection\n- lactic acid bacteria LOCATION_OF Lipids\n- NEDD8 INTERACTS_WITH Cells\n- Degenerative abnormality CAUSES Myopathy\n- Glucocorticoids TREATS Insulin Resistance\n\n    ### Instructions:\n            - Use standard medical knowledge as the primary guide.\n            - Consider enhanced information only if it aligns with consensus.\n            - If conflicting or unclear, present the most likely correct answer based on known facts.\n            - It's acceptable to show moderate confidence if the question is complex, but still choose one best answer.\n    ### Task:\n                1.

  "response": "```json\n{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Insulin resistance is a condition where the body's cells become less responsive to insulin, leading to higher blood sugar levels. It is not specifically associated with any particular type of insulin, such as huminsulin, but rather with the body's response to insulin in general. Infections can exacerbate insulin resistance due to stress and inflammation. Antibodies to insulin can also cause resistance by neutralizing the insulin's effects. Glucocorticoids, however, are known to increase insulin resistance rather than treat it, as they can raise blood sugar levels and worsen diabetes control. Therefore, the statement that glucocorticoids may be useful in severe cases of insulin resistance is incorrect.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opd\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
