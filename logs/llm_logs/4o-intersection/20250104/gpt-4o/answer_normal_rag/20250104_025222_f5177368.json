These compounds are involved in various biological functions such as vision (retinal), cellular growth and differentiation (retinoic acids), and immune function (retinol). The retrieved knowledge indicates associations of vitamin A with retinal diseases and night blindness, which are directly related to retinal. Therefore, all these forms of vitamin A are related to its function.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opd\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
