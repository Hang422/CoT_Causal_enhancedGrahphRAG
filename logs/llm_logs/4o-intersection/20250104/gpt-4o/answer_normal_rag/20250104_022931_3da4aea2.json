  "response": "```json\n{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Ethambutol is known to cause retrobulbar neuritis, which is an inflammation of the optic nerve behind the eye, leading to visual disturbances. This is a well-documented side effect of ethambutol, particularly affecting color vision and visual acuity. The other options, such as deafness, red urine, and peripheral neuritis, are not commonly associated with ethambutol. Therefore, the most likely correct answer is that ethambutol causes retrobulbar neuritis.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opa\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
