It follows zero order kinetics\nopb. Not an hepatic enzyme inducer\nopc. It is excreted unchanged in urine\nopd. It is not teratogenic\n\n### Retrieved Similar Medical Knowledge:\n- Valproate CAUSES Seizures\n- Phenytoin TREATS Embryopathies\n- CYP4V2 ASSOCIATED_WITH Depressive Symptoms\n- Banding procedure PREDISPOSES Gastrointestinal perforation\n- Heart tissue LOCATION_OF Image analysis\n- Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy TREATS Thyrotoxicosis\n- Phenytoin TREATS Liver Failure, Acute\n- Epidural Abscess, Spinal PROCESS_OF Campylobacter jejuni\n- Breast LOCATION_OF MDC1\n- treatment method TREATS Sleep disturbances\n- Phenytoin TREATS Seizures\n\n    ### Instructions:\n            - Use standard medical knowledge as the primary guide.\n            - Consider enhanced information only if it aligns with consensus.\n            - If conflicting or unclear, present the most likely correct answer based on known facts.\n            - It's acceptable to show moderate confidence if the question is complex, but still choose one best answer.\n    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3.

  "response": "```json\n{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Phenytoin is known to follow zero-order kinetics at therapeutic and higher concentrations, meaning that its rate of metabolism is constant regardless of its concentration. This is a well-established pharmacokinetic property of phenytoin. The other options are incorrect: phenytoin is a hepatic enzyme inducer, it is not excreted unchanged in urine (it is metabolized in the liver), and it is known to be teratogenic, particularly associated with fetal hydantoin syndrome.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opa\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
