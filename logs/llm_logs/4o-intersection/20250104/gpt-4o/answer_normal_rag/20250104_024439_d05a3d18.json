  "response": "```json\n{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Testosterone is primarily produced by the Leydig cells, which are located in the testes. These cells are responsible for the synthesis and secretion of testosterone, a key male sex hormone. The other options, such as Sertoli cells (likely a typo as 'Seolie cells'), seminiferous tubules, and the epididymis, do not primarily produce testosterone. Sertoli cells support spermatogenesis, seminiferous tubules are the site of sperm production, and the epididymis is involved in sperm maturation and storage. Therefore, the most accurate answer is that Leydig cells are the main contributors to testosterone production.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opa\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
