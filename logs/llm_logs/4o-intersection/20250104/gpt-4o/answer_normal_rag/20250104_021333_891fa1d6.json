  "response": "```json\n{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Dextromethorphan is known to cause hallucinations, especially at high doses. It acts on the central nervous system and can lead to dissociative effects similar to those of certain hallucinogens. This is a well-documented side effect and aligns with the known pharmacological properties of dextromethorphan. The other options, such as morphine, diphenhydramine, and aprepitant, are not typically associated with hallucinations in the context of their use as antitussives.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opb\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
