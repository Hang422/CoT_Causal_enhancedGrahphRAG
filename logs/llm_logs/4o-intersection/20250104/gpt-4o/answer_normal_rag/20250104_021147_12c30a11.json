Krabbe's disease and Fabry's disease are lysosomal storage disorders, not glycogen storage diseases. Fragile X syndrome is a genetic disorder related to the X chromosome and is not associated with glycogen storage. Therefore, all the options listed are not glycogen storage diseases, making 'All' the correct choice.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opd\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
