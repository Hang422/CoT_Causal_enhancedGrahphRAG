  "response": "```json\n{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Progesterone is primarily produced by the corpora lutea in the ovary. After ovulation, the remaining follicle transforms into the corpus luteum, which is responsible for the production of progesterone. This hormone is crucial for maintaining the uterine lining and supporting early pregnancy. The other options, such as stroma, corpora albicans, and mature follicles, do not primarily produce progesterone. The corpora albicans is the degenerated form of the corpus luteum and does not produce hormones.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opc\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
