  "response": "```json\n{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Brinzolamide is a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor used primarily in the treatment of glaucoma. It works by inhibiting the enzyme carbonic anhydrase, which reduces the production of aqueous humor in the eye, thereby lowering intraocular pressure. The mechanism of action of brinzolamide is known to be reversible and competitive, as it competes with the substrate for binding to the active site of the enzyme. This aligns with the characteristics of a reversible and competitive inhibitor.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opc\",\n    \"confidence\": 90\n}\n```",
