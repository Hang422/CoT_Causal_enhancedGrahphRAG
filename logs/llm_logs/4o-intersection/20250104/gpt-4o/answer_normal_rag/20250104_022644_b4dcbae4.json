Xylose\nopb. Mannose\nopc. Glucose\nopd. Ribose\n\n### Retrieved Similar Medical Knowledge:\n- Intestines LOCATION_OF Sugars\n- ileum LOCATION_OF Sugars\n- Occipital lobe LOCATION_OF Cerebral Aneurysm\n- Nerve Endings PART_OF Nerve\n- Endothelial Cells INTERACTS_WITH Aspartic Endopeptidases\n- Foreskin of penis LOCATION_OF Ulcer\n- Hydrocortisone PREDISPOSES Alzheimer's Disease\n\n    ### Instructions:\n            - Use standard medical knowledge as the primary guide.\n            - Consider enhanced information only if it aligns with consensus.\n            - If conflicting or unclear, present the most likely correct answer based on known facts.\n            - It's acceptable to show moderate confidence if the question is complex, but still choose one best answer.\n    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3.

  "response": "```json\n{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Glucose is the only sugar that is normally absorbed in the intestine against a concentration gradient. This process occurs through active transport mechanisms involving sodium-glucose transport proteins (SGLT1) in the intestinal epithelial cells. The other sugars listed, such as xylose, mannose, and ribose, are absorbed by passive diffusion or facilitated diffusion, which do not occur against a concentration gradient.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opc\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
