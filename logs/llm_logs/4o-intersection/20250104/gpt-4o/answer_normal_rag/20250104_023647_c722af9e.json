  "response": "```json\n{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Heparin is a well-known anticoagulant that works primarily by activating antithrombin, which in turn inhibits thrombin and factor Xa, thus preventing clot formation. It is commonly derived from pig intestinal mucosa, which aligns with option opb. Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is a recognized adverse effect, supporting option opd. However, the statement in option opa, 'Weakest acid found in living things,' does not accurately describe heparin. Heparin is a highly sulfated glycosaminoglycan and is not characterized as the weakest acid in living organisms. Therefore, option opa is the exception.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opa\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
