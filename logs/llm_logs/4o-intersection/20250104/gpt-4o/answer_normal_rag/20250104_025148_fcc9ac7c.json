Fatty acids\nopb. Ketone bodies\nopc. Glucose\nopd. Any of the above\n\n### Retrieved Similar Medical Knowledge:\n- Fixation of fracture using plate TREATS Respiratory Tract Infections\n- Muscle PART_OF Heart\n- ZMPSTE24 INTERACTS_WITH Cells\n- Pharmaceutical Preparations CAUSES Dermatitis, Phototoxic\n- Experimental drug TREATS Psychotic Disorders\n- Glucose ASSOCIATED_WITH Myocardial Ischemia\n- Colon LOCATION_OF Positron-Emission Tomography\n- Energy Metabolism PROCESS_OF Rat Heart\n\n    ### Instructions:\n            - Use standard medical knowledge as the primary guide.\n            - Consider enhanced information only if it aligns with consensus.\n            - If conflicting or unclear, present the most likely correct answer based on known facts.\n            - It's acceptable to show moderate confidence if the question is complex, but still choose one best answer.\n    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n                \n    ### Output Format\n    Provide your response in valid JSON format:\n    {   \n        \"final_analysis\": \"Your analysis of how the retrieved relationships support the answer\",\n        \"answer\": \"Option key from the available options (only key, like opa)\",\n        \"confidence\": Score between 0-100 based on evidence strength and relevance\n    }\n    "

  "response": "```json\n{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Under normal conditions, cardiac muscle primarily uses fatty acids as its main source of energy. This is because fatty acids provide a high yield of ATP, which is essential for the continuous and high-energy demands of the heart. While glucose and ketone bodies can also be used, fatty acids are the predominant energy source in a well-oxygenated state. The retrieved knowledge does not directly address this, but standard medical understanding supports fatty acids as the primary energy source for cardiac muscle under normal conditions.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opa\",\n    \"confidence\": 90\n}\n```",
