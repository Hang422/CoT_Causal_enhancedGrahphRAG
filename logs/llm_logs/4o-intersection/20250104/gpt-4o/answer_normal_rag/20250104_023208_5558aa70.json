  "response": "```json\n{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Propranolol, oral contraceptives, and reserpine are known to have depression as a potential side effect. Propranolol, a beta-blocker, can cause depression in some patients. Oral contraceptives have been associated with mood changes, including depression, in some women. Reserpine, an antihypertensive and antipsychotic, is well-documented to cause depression as a side effect. Flupenthixol, an antipsychotic, is less commonly associated with depression as a side effect and is sometimes used to treat depression in low doses. Therefore, it is the most likely option that does not have depression as a side effect.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opd\",\n    \"confidence\": 90\n}\n```",
