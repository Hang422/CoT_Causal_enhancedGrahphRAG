  "response": "```json\n{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Peptic ulcer disease caused by chronic use of NSAIDs is often due to the inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis, which protects the gastric mucosa. Misoprostol is a prostaglandin analog that can help prevent NSAID-induced gastric ulcers by replacing the protective prostaglandins. Esomeprazole, a proton pump inhibitor, is also used to treat peptic ulcers by reducing gastric acid secretion, but misoprostol is specifically indicated for NSAID-induced ulcers. Therefore, misoprostol is the drug of choice for this condition.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opc\",\n    \"confidence\": 90\n}\n```",
