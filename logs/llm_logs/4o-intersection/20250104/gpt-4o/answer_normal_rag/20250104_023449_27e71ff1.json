There was no added risk factors except for a LDL value of 150-165mgs/dl. The single drug most appropriate for initial therapy is\n\n    Options:\n    opa. Gemfibrozil\nopb. Nicotinic acid\nopc. Bile acid binding resins\nopd. Statins (Any)\n\n### Retrieved Similar Medical Knowledge:\n- Septicemia CAUSES Hyperglycemia\n- Electrocardiogram DIAGNOSES Fabry Disease\n- Placebos TREATS Myocardial Infarction\n- Antilipemic Agents TREATS Disease\n- Cardiac drug TREATS Disease\n- TIMM17A PART_OF Saccharomyces cerevisiae\n\n    ### Instructions:\n            - Use standard medical knowledge as the primary guide.\n            - Consider enhanced information only if it aligns with consensus.\n            - If conflicting or unclear, present the most likely correct answer based on known facts.\n            - It's acceptable to show moderate confidence if the question is complex, but still choose one best answer.\n    ### Task:\n                1.
