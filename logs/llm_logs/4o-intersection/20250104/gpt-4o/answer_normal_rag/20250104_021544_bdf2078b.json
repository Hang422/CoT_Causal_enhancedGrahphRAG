  "response": "```json\n{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Warfarin-induced skin necrosis is a rare complication that is most commonly associated with Protein C deficiency. Protein C is a natural anticoagulant, and its deficiency can lead to a hypercoagulable state, especially when warfarin is initiated. Warfarin initially reduces the levels of Protein C faster than other clotting factors, leading to a transient hypercoagulable state and potential skin necrosis. This is a well-documented phenomenon in medical literature.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opa\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
