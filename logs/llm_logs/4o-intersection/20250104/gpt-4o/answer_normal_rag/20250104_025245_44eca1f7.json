  "response": "```json\n{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Alpha-1 adrenergic blockers are commonly used to provide symptomatic relief in Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH) by relaxing the smooth muscles in the prostate and bladder neck, improving urine flow. Tamsulosin is a well-known selective alpha-1 adrenergic blocker specifically used for this purpose. Prazosin is also an alpha-1 blocker but is less commonly used for BPH compared to Tamsulosin. Oxazocin and Dolazoline are not recognized as standard treatments for BPH. Therefore, Tamsulosin is the most likely correct answer.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opa\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
