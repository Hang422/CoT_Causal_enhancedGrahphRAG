  "response": "```json\n{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"For prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism in patients undergoing cancer surgery, low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) is the preferred anticoagulant. This is based on its efficacy, safety profile, and ease of use compared to other anticoagulants. LMWH is commonly used in clinical practice for this purpose due to its predictable pharmacokinetics and lower risk of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia compared to unfractionated heparin. Protamine sulfate is not an anticoagulant; it is used to reverse the effects of heparin. Warfarin is not typically used for immediate prophylaxis in surgical settings due to its delayed onset of action and need for monitoring. Therefore, the most likely correct answer is low molecular weight heparin.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opc\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
