  "response": "```json\n{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"In the context of cancer chemotherapy-induced vomiting, several classes of antiemetic drugs are used. Aprepitant is a neurokinin-1 (NK1) receptor antagonist, dexamethasone is a corticosteroid, and ondansetron is a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist. All three are commonly used in combination to prevent chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV). Therefore, the most comprehensive answer is 'All of the above', as each drug plays a role in managing CINV.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opd\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
