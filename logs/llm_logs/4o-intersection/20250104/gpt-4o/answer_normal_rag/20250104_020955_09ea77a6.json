  "response": "```json\n{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Protease activated receptors (PARs) are a family of G-protein-coupled receptors that are indeed activated by proteases like thrombin. They are known to play roles in various physiological processes, including protecting epithelial cells. However, the release of PGE2 (prostaglandin E2) is not a direct function typically associated with PARs. PGE2 is more commonly linked to cyclooxygenase pathways and inflammation processes. Therefore, the statement that PARs release PGE2 is likely incorrect.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opc\",\n    \"confidence\": 90\n}\n```",
