  "response": "```json\n{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Metoclopramide is known to cause hyperprolactinemia as a side effect. It is a dopamine antagonist, and dopamine normally inhibits prolactin secretion. Therefore, blocking dopamine receptors with metoclopramide can lead to increased levels of prolactin. The other options, such as bromocriptine, are actually used to treat hyperprolactinemia, and levodopa and amantadine do not typically cause this condition.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opd\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
