While Metronidazole is mentioned as treating nonspecific urethritis, it is not the first-line treatment for gonococcal infections. Azithromycin, on the other hand, is often used in combination with other antibiotics like ceftriaxone to treat gonococcal infections and is also effective against non-gonococcal urethritis, such as those caused by Chlamydia trachomatis. Therefore, Azithromycin is the most appropriate choice for treating both conditions.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opd\",\n    \"confidence\": 90\n}\n```",
