Streptomycin\nopb. Ethambutol\nopc. Capreomycin\nopd. Rifampicin\n\n### Retrieved Similar Medical Knowledge:\n- Antitubercular Agents TREATS Kidney Failure, Acute\n- Antitubercular Agents TREATS Kidney Failure\n- Migraine Variant ISA Headache\n- Clipping TREATS Vasospasm\n- Antitubercular Agents TREATS Renal Insufficiency\n\n    ### Instructions:\n            - Use standard medical knowledge as the primary guide.\n            - Consider enhanced information only if it aligns with consensus.\n            - If conflicting or unclear, present the most likely correct answer based on known facts.\n            - It's acceptable to show moderate confidence if the question is complex, but still choose one best answer.\n    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3.

  "response": "```json\n{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"In the context of severe renal failure, the use of antitubercular drugs must be carefully considered due to the potential for drug accumulation and toxicity. Streptomycin and capreomycin are aminoglycosides, which are known to be nephrotoxic and require dose adjustments or avoidance in renal impairment. Ethambutol is also excreted by the kidneys and typically requires dose adjustment in renal failure. Rifampicin, however, is primarily metabolized by the liver and does not require dose adjustment in renal failure, making it the safest option among the listed drugs for use in severe renal failure.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opd\",\n    \"confidence\": 90\n}\n```",
