  "response": "```json\n{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Cholesterol is transported from the liver to peripheral tissues primarily by low-density lipoproteins (LDL). LDL is known for carrying cholesterol to cells throughout the body, which is why it is often referred to as 'bad cholesterol' due to its association with plaque buildup in arteries. High-density lipoproteins (HDL) are involved in reverse cholesterol transport, carrying cholesterol away from tissues back to the liver. Very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL) primarily transport triglycerides, and chylomicrons are responsible for transporting dietary lipids from the intestines. Therefore, the most likely correct answer is LDL.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opb\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
