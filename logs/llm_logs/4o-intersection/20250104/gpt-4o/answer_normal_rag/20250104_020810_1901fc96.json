  "response": "```json\n{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Atropine is a muscarinic receptor blocker, which means it specifically blocks the effects of acetylcholine on muscarinic receptors. Bradycardia caused by the infusion of acetylcholine is mediated through muscarinic receptors, and atropine can effectively block this effect. The increased blood pressure caused by nicotine and increased skeletal muscle strength caused by neostigmine are mediated through nicotinic receptors, which are not affected by atropine. Therefore, atropine would not block these effects. Thus, the correct answer is that atropine can block bradycardia caused by the infusion of acetylcholine.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opc\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
