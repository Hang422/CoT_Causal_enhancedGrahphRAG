  "response": "```json\n{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Rifampicin is known to interact with protease inhibitors like indinavir by inducing cytochrome P450 enzymes, which can lead to reduced plasma levels of indinavir and potentially compromise HIV treatment efficacy. Therefore, in a patient on zidovudine, lamivudine, and indinavir, rifampicin should be avoided to prevent this drug interaction. The other anti-tubercular drugs listed (pyrazinamide, isoniazid, and ethambutol) do not have the same level of interaction with indinavir.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opd\",\n    \"confidence\": 90\n}\n```",
