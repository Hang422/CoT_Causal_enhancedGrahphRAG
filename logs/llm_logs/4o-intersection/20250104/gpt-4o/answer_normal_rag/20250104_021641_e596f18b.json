  "response": "```json\n{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Secretin is a hormone primarily involved in the regulation of the pH of the duodenum by stimulating the pancreas to secrete bicarbonate-rich fluid. This action helps neutralize the acidic chyme that enters the small intestine from the stomach. While secretin also has other effects, such as inhibiting gastric acid secretion and affecting the pyloric sphincter, its most significant and primary role is to increase the secretion of bicarbonates by the pancreas. This aligns with the physiological role of secretin in maintaining the optimal pH for enzymatic activity in the small intestine.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opb\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
