It is indicated for the treatment of Ascaris (a type of intestinal parasitic infection), Filariasis (a group of diseases caused by filarial worms), and Onchocerciasis (also known as river blindness). However, it is not indicated for the treatment of Malaria, which is caused by Plasmodium parasites and typically treated with antimalarial drugs such as chloroquine, artemisinin-based combination therapies, or others. Therefore, the option that does not align with the known indications of Ivermectin is Malaria.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opc\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
