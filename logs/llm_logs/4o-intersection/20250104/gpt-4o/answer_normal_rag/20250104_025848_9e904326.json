  "response": "```json\n{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"In cases of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) suspected in a fetus, dexamethasone is often used to prevent virilization in female fetuses. Dexamethasone is a potent glucocorticoid that can cross the placenta and suppress the fetal adrenal gland's overproduction of androgens. This is a well-established treatment approach in prenatal management of CAH. The retrieved information does not directly mention dexamethasone in this context, but standard medical practice supports its use for this purpose.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opa\",\n    \"confidence\": 90\n}\n```",
