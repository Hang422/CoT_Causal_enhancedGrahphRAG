  "response": "```json\n{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"INH (Isoniazid) induced neuropathy is commonly treated with pyridoxine (vitamin B6) because INH can cause a deficiency in this vitamin, leading to peripheral neuropathy. Pyridoxine supplementation helps prevent and treat this condition. While thiamine is also mentioned as a treatment for neuropathy, it is not specifically used for INH-induced neuropathy. Therefore, based on standard medical knowledge, pyridoxine is the most appropriate treatment for INH-induced neuropathy.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opb\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
