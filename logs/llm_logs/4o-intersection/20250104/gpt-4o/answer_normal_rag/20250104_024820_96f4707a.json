  "response": "```json\n{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Tamoxifen is a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) used in the treatment of breast cancer. It is known to have several adverse effects. Thromboembolism is a well-documented risk associated with tamoxifen due to its estrogenic effects on the coagulation system. Endometrial carcinoma is another known risk because tamoxifen acts as an estrogen agonist in the uterus, potentially leading to hyperplasia and cancer. Cataracts have also been reported as a side effect of tamoxifen. However, tamoxifen is not associated with an increased risk of carcinoma in the contralateral breast; in fact, it is used to reduce the risk of breast cancer in the opposite breast. Therefore, the correct answer is that tamoxifen does not cause carcinoma in the contralateral breast.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opc\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
