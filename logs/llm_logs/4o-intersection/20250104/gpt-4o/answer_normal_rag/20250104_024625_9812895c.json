  "response": "```json\n{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Amyloidosis associated with multiple myeloma is known to have a poor prognosis, but it is not necessarily the poorest among all types of amyloidosis. Fine-needle biopsy of subcutaneous abdominal fat is indeed a reliable method for diagnosing secondary systemic amyloidosis. Hepatic amyloid disease typically causes hepatomegaly and rarely jaundice, which is consistent with known medical knowledge. Amyloidosis of the spleen is not typically associated with severe anemia; rather, it is more commonly associated with splenomegaly and potential hypersplenism, which can lead to anemia, but this is not a direct association. Therefore, the statement about amyloidosis of the spleen causing severe anemia is the least accurate.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opd\",\n    \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
