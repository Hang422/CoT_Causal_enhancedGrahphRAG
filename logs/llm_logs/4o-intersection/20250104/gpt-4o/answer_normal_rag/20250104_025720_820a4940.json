  "response": "```json\n{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Loop diuretics are known as 'high ceiling' diuretics because they have a potent diuretic effect (option opa is true). They act on the Na+-K+-2Cl- symporter in the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle (option opb is true). They can cause hyperuricemia due to increased reabsorption of uric acid (option opc is true). However, loop diuretics typically cause hypocalcemia, not hypercalcemia, and hypomagnesemia due to increased excretion of calcium and magnesium. Therefore, option opd is incorrect as it states that loop diuretics lead to hypercalcemia.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opd\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
