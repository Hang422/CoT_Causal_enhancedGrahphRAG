  "response": "```json\n{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Rosiglitazone is a thiazolidinedione, which primarily works by increasing insulin sensitivity in peripheral tissues rather than directly stimulating insulin release from the pancreas. In contrast, Nateglinide, Glimipiride, and Tolbutamide are known to stimulate insulin release from pancreatic beta cells. Therefore, Rosiglitazone does not cause insulin release directly.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opa\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
