  "response": "```json\n{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Glycoproteins are proteins that have carbohydrate groups attached to the polypeptide chain. The attachment of the carbohydrate moiety to the protein is typically through a glycosidic bond, which is a covalent bond formed between a carbohydrate and another molecule. This aligns with option 'opa', which states that glycoproteins are proteins linked with a glycosidic bond. The other options do not accurately describe the characteristics of glycoproteins: 'Core protein' is a vague term and not specific to glycoproteins, and 'Sugar residues are long in carbohydrate portion of glycoprotein' is not a defining characteristic as glycoproteins can have varying lengths of carbohydrate chains.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opa\",\n    \"confidence\": 90\n}\n```",
