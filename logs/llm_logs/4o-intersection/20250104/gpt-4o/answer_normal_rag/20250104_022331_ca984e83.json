It is also used as an immunostimulant, particularly in certain cancer therapies. However, there is no standard medical knowledge supporting its use as an immunodepressant in high doses. Therefore, the option that does not align with the known uses of Levamisole is its use as an immunodepressant.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opd\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
