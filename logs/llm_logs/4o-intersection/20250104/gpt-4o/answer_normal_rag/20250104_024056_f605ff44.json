  "response": "```json\n{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Enalapril is an ACE inhibitor commonly used to treat hypertension, especially in patients with diabetes due to its renal protective effects. It is contraindicated in patients with renal artery stenosis, pregnancy, and hyperkalemia due to the risk of worsening renal function, teratogenic effects, and further increasing potassium levels, respectively. Therefore, the best candidate for enalapril as a first-line agent is the 56-year-old diabetic woman, as ACE inhibitors are beneficial in managing hypertension in diabetic patients by providing renal protection.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opd\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
