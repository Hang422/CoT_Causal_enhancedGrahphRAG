  "response": "```json\n{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Insulin is a hormone produced by the beta cells of the pancreas, not the alpha cells, which produce glucagon. Insulin consists of two polypeptide chains, A and B, which are connected by disulfide bonds. Insulin facilitates the uptake of glucose and potassium into cells, not the shift of potassium outside the cell. The half-life of subcutaneously administered insulin is typically shorter than 60 minutes, often around 4-6 minutes for endogenous insulin, but longer for some exogenous forms. Therefore, the statement that insulin consists of two polypeptide chains bound by disulfide linkages is correct.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opb\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
