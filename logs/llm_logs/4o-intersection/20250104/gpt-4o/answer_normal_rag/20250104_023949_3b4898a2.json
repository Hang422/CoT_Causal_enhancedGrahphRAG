  "response": "```json\n{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Steroids are commonly used as adjunctive therapy in tuberculosis to reduce inflammation and prevent complications in certain forms. They are indicated in tuberculous meningitis and pericarditis to reduce inflammation and prevent complications like constrictive pericarditis. In ileo-caecal tuberculosis, steroids are not typically indicated as the primary treatment is anti-tubercular therapy. In cases of adrenal involvement, steroids are not indicated because the adrenal glands are already producing insufficient steroids due to the disease, and the treatment involves replacement therapy rather than additional steroid use. Therefore, the exception where steroids are not indicated is adrenal involvement.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opd\",\n    \"confidence\": 90\n}\n```",
