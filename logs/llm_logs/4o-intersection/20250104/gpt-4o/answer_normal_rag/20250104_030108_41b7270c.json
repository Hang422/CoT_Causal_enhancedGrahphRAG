  "response": "```json\n{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Gp2b3A inhibitors, also known as glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors, are a class of antiplatelet agents that include drugs like Abciximab, Eptifibatide, and Tirofiban. These drugs work by inhibiting the glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor on platelets, preventing platelet aggregation. Prasugrel, on the other hand, is a thienopyridine class antiplatelet agent that works by inhibiting the P2Y12 ADP receptor on platelets, not the glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor. Therefore, Prasugrel is not a Gp2b3A inhibitor.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opd\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
