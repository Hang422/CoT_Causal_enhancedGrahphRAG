  "response": "```json\n{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Tamoxifen is a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) that is known to cause endometrial hyperplasia as a side effect. This is supported by the retrieved medical knowledge indicating that Tamoxifen causes endometrial hyperplasia. The other options, such as osteoporosis, ovarian cancer, and decreased triglyceride levels, are not commonly associated with Tamoxifen. In fact, Tamoxifen is known to treat hyperlipidemia, which aligns with the decrease in triglyceride levels, but this is not a direct cause. Therefore, the most likely correct answer is that Tamoxifen causes endometrial hyperplasia.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opb\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
