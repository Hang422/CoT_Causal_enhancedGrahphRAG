  "response": "```json\n{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Mannitol is an osmotic diuretic that is generally contraindicated in patients with cardiac failure because it can increase the intravascular volume and exacerbate heart failure symptoms. The other diuretics listed, such as spironolactone, furosemide, and hydrochlorothiazide, are commonly used in the management of heart failure. Therefore, based on standard medical knowledge, mannitol is the diuretic that is contraindicated in the presence of cardiac failure.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opa\",\n    \"confidence\": 90\n}\n```",
