  "response": "```json\n{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Hypermagnesemia is typically associated with conditions that lead to decreased renal excretion of magnesium. Hyperparathyroidism can lead to increased renal reabsorption of magnesium, potentially causing hypermagnesemia. Diabetes mellitus, kwashiorkor, and primary aldosteronism are not commonly associated with hypermagnesemia. In diabetes mellitus, there is often an association with hypomagnesemia due to increased renal losses. Kwashiorkor, a form of malnutrition, does not typically cause hypermagnesemia. Primary aldosteronism is associated with hypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis, not hypermagnesemia. Therefore, the most likely condition associated with hypermagnesemia is hyperparathyroidism.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opa\",\n    \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
