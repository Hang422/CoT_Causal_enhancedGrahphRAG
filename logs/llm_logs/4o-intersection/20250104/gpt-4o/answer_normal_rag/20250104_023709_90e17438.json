  "response": "```json\n{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Aspirin is known to predispose individuals to ulcers, particularly peptic ulcers, due to its mechanism of inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis, which can compromise the gastric mucosal barrier. This makes peptic ulcer a contraindication for aspirin use. The retrieved knowledge supports this as it mentions that aspirin predisposes to ulcers. Therefore, the most likely correct answer is that aspirin is contraindicated in peptic ulcer.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opb\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
