  "response": "```json\n{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Cholestatic jaundice is a condition where there is an obstruction in the bile flow, leading to jaundice. Among the listed options, erythromycin estolate is well-documented in medical literature as a cause of cholestatic jaundice. This is due to its potential to cause liver injury, specifically cholestatic hepatitis, which can lead to jaundice. The other options, such as INH (isoniazid), pyrazinamide, and ethionamide, are more commonly associated with hepatocellular injury rather than cholestatic jaundice.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opb\",\n    \"confidence\": 90\n}\n```",
