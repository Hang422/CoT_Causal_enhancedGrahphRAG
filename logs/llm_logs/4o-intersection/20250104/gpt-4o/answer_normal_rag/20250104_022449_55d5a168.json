  "response": "```json\n{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"The plasma membrane is connected to the cytoskeleton through various proteins. Spectrin and ankyrin are key components of the cytoskeletal network that link the plasma membrane to the cytoskeleton. Spectrin forms a meshwork that supports the plasma membrane, while ankyrin anchors spectrin to the membrane. Tubulin is a component of microtubules, which are part of the cytoskeleton but not directly involved in linking the plasma membrane to the cytoskeleton. Laminin is an extracellular matrix protein and does not directly bind the plasma membrane to the cytoskeleton. Therefore, the most likely correct answer is ankyrin, as it directly binds the plasma membrane to the cytoskeleton.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opb\",\n    \"confidence\": 90\n}\n```",
