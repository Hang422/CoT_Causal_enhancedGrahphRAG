  "response": "```json\n{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Myopathy is a known side effect of several drugs, particularly those that affect muscle metabolism or mitochondrial function. Chloroquine is known to cause myopathy as it can lead to muscle weakness and damage. Zidovudine, an antiretroviral drug, is also associated with myopathy due to its mitochondrial toxicity. Chloramphenicol, an antibiotic, is not commonly associated with myopathy. Betamethasone, a corticosteroid, is not typically linked to myopathy; in fact, corticosteroids are sometimes used to treat inflammatory myopathies. Therefore, the drug that does not cause myopathy among the options is most likely Betamethasone.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opb\",\n    \"confidence\": 90\n}\n```",
