  "response": "```json\n{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"The stomach secretes several substances that aid in digestion. Pepsinogens are secreted by the chief cells in the stomach and are precursors to pepsin, an enzyme that digests proteins. Hydrochloric acid (HCl) is secreted by the parietal cells and helps create an acidic environment for pepsin to function. Lipase is also secreted by the stomach, although in smaller amounts compared to the pancreas, and aids in the digestion of lipids. Therefore, all the options listed (Lipase, Pepsinogens, HCl) are secreted by the stomach. The option 'None' implies that all listed substances are indeed secreted by the stomach, which is correct.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opd\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
