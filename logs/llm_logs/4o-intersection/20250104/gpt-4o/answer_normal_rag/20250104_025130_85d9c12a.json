  "response": "```json\n{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Epinephrine, when administered intravenously in high doses, is known to increase liver glycogenolysis, evoke extrasystoles in the heart, and produce restlessness and anxiety. These effects are consistent with its action as a sympathomimetic agent. However, epinephrine typically causes bronchodilation rather than bronchoconstriction due to its action on beta-2 adrenergic receptors in the lungs. Therefore, causing bronchiolar constriction is not an expected action of epinephrine.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opb\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
