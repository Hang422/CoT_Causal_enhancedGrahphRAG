  "response": "```json\n{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Spironolactone is a potassium-sparing diuretic that can increase serum potassium levels. ACE inhibitors, like spironolactone, also have the potential to increase potassium levels. The concurrent use of spironolactone and ACE inhibitors can lead to hyperkalemia, which is a potentially dangerous condition. Therefore, ACE inhibitors are contraindicated with spironolactone due to the risk of hyperkalemia.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opc\",\n    \"confidence\": 90\n}\n```",
