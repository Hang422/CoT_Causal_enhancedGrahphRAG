  "response": "```json\n{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Fluconazole is an antifungal medication that works by inhibiting the enzyme lanosterol 14-alpha-demethylase, which is crucial in the synthesis of ergosterol, an essential component of fungal cell membranes. This mechanism aligns with option opd, which states that fluconazole inhibits demethylation of lanosterol. The other options are incorrect: fluconazole is not highly effective against aspergillosis (opa), it does penetrate the blood-brain barrier (opb), and it has better oral bioavailability than ketoconazole (opc).\",\n    \"answer\": \"opd\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
