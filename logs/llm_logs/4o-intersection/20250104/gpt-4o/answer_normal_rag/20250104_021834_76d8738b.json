  "response": "```json\n{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"In the process of fatty acid oxidation within the mitochondria, free fatty acids are transported in the bloodstream bound to albumin. Albumin is a protein that helps in the transport of free fatty acids from the adipose tissue to various tissues, including the liver and muscle, where they undergo oxidation in the mitochondria. The other options, such as globulins and chylomicrons, are not primarily involved in the transport of free fatty acids to the mitochondria for oxidation. Chylomicrons are involved in the transport of dietary lipids from the intestines to other locations in the body, but not specifically in the transport of free fatty acids to mitochondria.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opb\",\n    \"confidence\": 90\n}\n```",
