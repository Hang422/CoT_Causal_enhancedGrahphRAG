  "response": "```json\n{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Aminoglycosides are known to cause ototoxicity, which primarily affects the cochlea in the inner ear. The damage is most commonly associated with the outer hair cells, particularly in the basal turn of the cochlea. This area is responsible for high-frequency sound detection, and damage here leads to sensorineural hearing loss. The retrieved knowledge supports that aminoglycosides cause cochlear lesions and sensorineural hearing loss, which aligns with the understanding that outer hair cells in the basal area are affected.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opa\",\n    \"confidence\": 90\n}\n```",
