  "response": "```json\n{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Hyperammonemia is a common feature in urea cycle disorders, which include deficiencies in enzymes such as argininosuccinate synthetase, carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I, and ornithine transcarbamoylase. These enzymes are directly involved in the urea cycle, and their deficiencies lead to an accumulation of ammonia. However, ornithine aminotransferase is not part of the urea cycle; it is involved in the metabolism of ornithine and does not typically cause hyperammonemia when deficient. Therefore, the exception to hyperammonemia among the given options is ornithine aminotransferase deficiency.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opd\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
