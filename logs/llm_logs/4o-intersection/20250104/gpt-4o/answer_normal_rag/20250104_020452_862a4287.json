While the retrieved knowledge mentions various drug classes, antipsychotics are the mainstay treatment for managing the symptoms of schizophrenia. Antidepressants and mood stabilizers may be used adjunctively in some cases, and antiepileptics are not typically first-line treatments for schizophrenia. Therefore, the most appropriate and consensus-supported option is antipsychotics.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opb\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
