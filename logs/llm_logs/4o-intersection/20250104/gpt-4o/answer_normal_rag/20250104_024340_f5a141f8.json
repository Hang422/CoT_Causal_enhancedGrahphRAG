  "response": "```json\n{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Adrenal insufficiency, also known as Addison's disease, is characterized by a deficiency in the production of adrenal hormones, particularly cortisol and aldosterone. This condition is commonly associated with hyponatremia due to the lack of aldosterone, which leads to sodium loss. Hyperkalemia is also a common feature because aldosterone normally promotes potassium excretion. Hypoglycemia can occur due to cortisol deficiency, which affects glucose metabolism. However, metabolic alkalosis is not typically associated with adrenal insufficiency. In fact, the condition is more likely to cause metabolic acidosis due to the accumulation of hydrogen ions and decreased bicarbonate reabsorption. Therefore, metabolic alkalosis is the least likely to be associated with adrenal insufficiency.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opd\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
