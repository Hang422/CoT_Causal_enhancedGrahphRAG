  "response": "```json\n{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Neurogenic diabetes insipidus, also known as central diabetes insipidus, is typically treated with desmopressin. Desmopressin is a synthetic analog of vasopressin and is specifically used to manage central diabetes insipidus by replacing the deficient antidiuretic hormone. The retrieved medical knowledge supports this, as it mentions desmopressin acetate as a treatment for central diabetes insipidus. Other options like vasopressin are also used, but desmopressin is preferred due to its longer duration of action and fewer side effects.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opc\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
