  "response": "```json\n{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Uricosuric drugs are agents that increase the excretion of uric acid in the urine, thus lowering the concentration of uric acid in the blood. Probenecid is a well-known uricosuric agent used in the treatment of gout by promoting the excretion of uric acid. Allopurinol, on the other hand, is a xanthine oxidase inhibitor that reduces the production of uric acid. Indomethacin is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) used to reduce inflammation and pain, and aspirin, at low doses, can actually reduce uric acid excretion. Therefore, based on standard pharmacological knowledge, Probenecid is the correct answer.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opb\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
