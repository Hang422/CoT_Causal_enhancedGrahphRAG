  "response": "```json\n{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"The hormone responsible for uterine contractions during labor and delivery is oxytocin. Oxytocin is produced in the hypothalamus and then stored and released by the posterior pituitary gland. However, the production site is the hypothalamus, which aligns with option 'opa'. The posterior pituitary is involved in the storage and release, not production, which is a common point of confusion.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opa\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
