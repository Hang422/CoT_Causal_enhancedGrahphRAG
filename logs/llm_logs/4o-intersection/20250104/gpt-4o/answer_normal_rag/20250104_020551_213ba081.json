  "response": "```json\n{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Iron is primarily absorbed in the duodenum, which is the first part of the small intestine immediately following the stomach. This is a well-established fact in physiology, as the duodenum is the main site for the absorption of iron in its ferrous form. The retrieved information does not directly address iron absorption, but standard medical knowledge supports the duodenum as the primary site for iron absorption.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opb\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
