This condition is caused by a deficiency of the enzyme hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT), which is not listed among the options. However, the closest option that aligns with the symptoms and the condition is 'HGPase', which could be a typographical error or misrepresentation of HPRT. The other enzymes listed do not match the symptomatology or the known biochemical basis of Lesch-Nyhan syndrome.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opa\",\n    \"confidence\": 90\n}\n```",
