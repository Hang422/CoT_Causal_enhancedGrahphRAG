  "response": "```json\n{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Pulmonary fibrosis is a known complication of several drugs, particularly those used in chemotherapy. Among the options provided, Busulfan is well-documented to cause pulmonary fibrosis as a side effect. Methotrexate can also cause pulmonary fibrosis, but it is less common compared to Busulfan. Doxorubicin and Cisplatin are not typically associated with pulmonary fibrosis. Therefore, based on standard medical knowledge, Busulfan is the most likely drug to cause pulmonary fibrosis.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opd\",\n    \"confidence\": 90\n}\n```",
