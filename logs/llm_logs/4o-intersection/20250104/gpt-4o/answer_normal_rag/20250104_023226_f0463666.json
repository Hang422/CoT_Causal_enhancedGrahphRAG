  "response": "```json\n{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"In diabetic ketoacidosis, there is a decrease in insulin levels, which leads to an increase in free fatty acids due to enhanced lipolysis. These free fatty acids are converted into ketone bodies, causing ketoacidosis. The increase in blood glucose is due to decreased insulin and increased glucagon, which promotes gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis. Therefore, the feature of ketoacidosis due to diabetes mellitus is characterized by a decreased insulin level and increased free fatty acids, which are not equivalent to blood glucose levels. This aligns with option opc.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opc\",\n    \"confidence\": 90\n}\n```",
