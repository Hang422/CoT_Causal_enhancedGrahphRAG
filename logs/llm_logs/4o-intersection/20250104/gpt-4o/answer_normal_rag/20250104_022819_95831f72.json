  "response": "```json\n{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord is a well-known consequence of vitamin B12 deficiency. This condition is characterized by the degeneration of the dorsal columns and lateral columns of the spinal cord, leading to neurological symptoms. The retrieved medical knowledge supports this association, as it explicitly states that vitamin B12 deficiency causes subacute combined degeneration. Although there is a mention of folic acid (vitamin B9) deficiency causing subacute combined degeneration, this is less commonly recognized and typically occurs in conjunction with vitamin B12 deficiency. Therefore, the most likely correct answer is vitamin B12 deficiency.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opd\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
