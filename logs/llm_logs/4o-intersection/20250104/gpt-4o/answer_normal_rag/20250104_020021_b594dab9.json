  "response": "```json\n{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Octreotide is a somatostatin analogue that is commonly used to treat bleeding esophageal varices. It works by reducing portal blood flow and variceal pressure, which helps control bleeding. The retrieved medical knowledge explicitly states that Octreotide treats esophageal varices, supporting its use as the drug of choice in this scenario. Other options, such as Ethanolamine oleate, are used for sclerotherapy, and Propranolol is used for prophylaxis, not acute treatment. Phytonadione (vitamin K) is not relevant for acute variceal bleeding.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opb\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
