  "response": "```json\n{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"The fluidity of the plasma membrane is influenced by the types of fatty acids present in the phospholipids. Unsaturated fatty acids, such as arachidonic acid, increase membrane fluidity due to the presence of double bonds that introduce kinks, preventing tight packing of the lipid molecules. In contrast, saturated fatty acids like palmitic acid and stearic acid tend to decrease fluidity as they allow for tighter packing. Cholesterol can have a dual role, but generally, it tends to stabilize the membrane and decrease fluidity at higher concentrations. Therefore, arachidonic acid, being an unsaturated fatty acid, is most likely to increase membrane fluidity.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opa\",\n    \"confidence\": 90\n}\n```",
