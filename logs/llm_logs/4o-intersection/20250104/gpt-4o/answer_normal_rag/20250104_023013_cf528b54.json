Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n                \n    ### Output Format\n    Provide your response in valid JSON format:\n    {   \n        \"final_analysis\": \"Your analysis of how the retrieved relationships support the answer\",\n        \"answer\": \"Option key from the available options (only key, like opa)\",\n        \"confidence\": Score between 0-100 based on evidence strength and relevance\n    }\n    "

  "response": "```json\n{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Diabetes insipidus is characterized by the inability of the kidneys to concentrate urine due to a deficiency of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) or a lack of response to it. This results in the production of large volumes of dilute urine. Typically, urine osmolality in diabetes insipidus is low, often less than 300 mmol/L, as the kidneys are unable to concentrate the urine effectively.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opb\",\n    \"confidence\": 90\n}\n```",
