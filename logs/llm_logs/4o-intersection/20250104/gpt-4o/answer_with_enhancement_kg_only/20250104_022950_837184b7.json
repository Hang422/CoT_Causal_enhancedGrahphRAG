ENL\nopb. HIV neuropathy\nopc. HIV associated ulcer\nopd. Behcet's syndrome\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nThalidomide is well-established for use in ENL (erythema nodosum leprosum) due to its anti-inflammatory effects, and it is also used in Behcet's syndrome for its immunomodulatory properties. However, thalidomide is not typically used for HIV neuropathy, as there is a lack of evidence supporting its efficacy in this condition. While there is some consideration of thalidomide for HIV-associated ulcers, its efficacy remains unclear and not well-supported by evidence. Therefore, the consensus indicates that thalidomide is used in all listed conditions except HIV neuropathy.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Thalidomide is a medication with known uses in certain inflammatory and immunological conditions. It is well-documented for its effectiveness in treating erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) and Behcet's syndrome due to its anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties. While there is some exploration of its use in HIV-associated ulcers, the evidence is not robust, and it is not a standard treatment. Importantly, thalidomide is not used for HIV neuropathy, as there is no substantial evidence supporting its efficacy in this condition. Therefore, based on standard medical knowledge and consensus, thalidomide is used in all listed conditions except HIV neuropathy.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
