Diclofenac\nopb. Acetaminophen\nopc. Ibuprofen\nopd. Naproxen\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nAcetaminophen is known to cause minimal gastric irritation because it primarily acts centrally and has negligible COX inhibition in the stomach, aligning with the consensus that it is the least likely to cause gastric irritation among the options. Diclofenac, ibuprofen, and naproxen are traditional NSAIDs that inhibit COX enzymes, leading to reduced prostaglandin synthesis and increased gastric irritation. Diclofenac and ibuprofen have moderate COX inhibition, while naproxen has strong COX inhibition, making it more likely to cause gastric irritation. The evidence paths confirm that acetaminophen interacts with stomach-related enzymes but do not directly inhibit COX in the stomach, supporting its minimal gastric irritation profile. Therefore, acetaminophen is the best choice for least gastric irritation.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The core medical principle here is the degree of gastric irritation caused by different analgesics. Acetaminophen (paracetamol) is not a traditional NSAID and primarily acts centrally, with minimal peripheral COX inhibition, which is why it is associated with the least gastric irritation. In contrast, diclofenac, ibuprofen, and naproxen are traditional NSAIDs that inhibit COX enzymes, leading to reduced prostaglandin synthesis and increased gastric irritation. Among these, naproxen is known for stronger COX inhibition and is more likely to cause gastric irritation. Therefore, based on standard medical knowledge and consensus, acetaminophen is the least likely to cause gastric irritation among the options provided.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
