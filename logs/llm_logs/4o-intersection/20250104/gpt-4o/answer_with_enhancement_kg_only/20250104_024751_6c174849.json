Protein linked with glycosidic bond\nopb. Core protein\nopc. Sugar residues are long in carbohydrate poion of glycoprotein\nopd. None\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nGlycoproteins are proteins that have carbohydrate groups attached to the polypeptide chain. The attachment is typically through glycosidic bonds, which aligns with option 'opa'. The term 'core protein' in option 'opb' is not a defining characteristic of glycoproteins, as it is more relevant to proteoglycans. Option 'opc' is misleading because glycoproteins generally have shorter carbohydrate chains compared to proteoglycans. The evidence path indicating glycoproteins are part of cellular structures supports their role in cellular functions but does not directly address the specific characteristics in the options. Therefore, the most accurate characteristic of glycoproteins is that they are proteins linked with glycosidic bonds, supporting option 'opa'.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

This attachment occurs through glycosidic bonds, which is a defining feature of glycoproteins. The term 'core protein' is more applicable to proteoglycans, which have a different structure and function compared to glycoproteins. Additionally, glycoproteins typically have shorter carbohydrate chains, distinguishing them from proteoglycans that have longer chains. Therefore, the most accurate characteristic of glycoproteins from the given options is that they are proteins linked with glycosidic bonds, aligning with option 'opa'.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
