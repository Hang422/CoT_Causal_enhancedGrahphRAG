Alpha IEN\nopb. Beta IFN\nopc. Gamma IFN\nopd. Natalizumab\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nFor relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS), the drug of choice is typically Beta Interferon (Beta IFN). Beta IFN modulates the immune response, reduces inflammation, and decreases the relapse rate, which aligns with standard medical consensus. Natalizumab is another effective treatment option; it works by blocking immune cell migration, thereby preventing CNS inflammation and reducing relapse frequency. However, it is generally considered when patients do not respond to first-line treatments like Beta IFN. Gamma Interferon is not recommended for MS as it may worsen symptoms. Alpha IEN lacks an established benefit for MS and is not recommended. The evidence paths confirm the role of natalizumab in interacting with immune cells, supporting its mechanism of action in preventing CNS inflammation. Overall, Beta IFN remains the first-line treatment for RRMS.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) is commonly treated with disease-modifying therapies that aim to reduce the frequency and severity of relapses. Beta Interferon (Beta IFN) is widely recognized as a first-line treatment for RRMS due to its ability to modulate the immune system and decrease relapse rates. Natalizumab is another effective treatment but is typically reserved for patients who do not respond adequately to first-line therapies like Beta IFN due to its risk profile, including the potential for progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). Gamma Interferon is contraindicated in MS as it can exacerbate the disease, and Alpha IEN is not recognized as a treatment for MS. Therefore, based on standard medical consensus and the enhanced information provided, Beta IFN is the most likely correct answer as the drug of choice for RRMS.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
