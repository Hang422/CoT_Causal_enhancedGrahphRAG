Imipramine\nopb. Fluvoxamine\nopc. Phenelzine\nopd. Bupropion\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nImipramine is a tricyclic antidepressant known for its anticholinergic effects, which can reduce bladder contractions and thereby decrease nocturnal enuresis. This aligns with the consensus that tricyclic antidepressants can be used to treat bedwetting due to their impact on bladder function. The retrieved evidence supports this by linking Imipramine to tricyclic antidepressants, which are known to treat conditions like bedwetting. In contrast, Fluvoxamine, Phenelzine, and Bupropion do not have direct effects on bladder function and are unlikely to be effective for nocturnal enuresis. Fluvoxamine is an SSRI, Phenelzine is an MAOI, and Bupropion is an NDRI, none of which are typically used for this condition. Therefore, Imipramine is the most appropriate choice for treating nocturnal enuresis among the options provided.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The question asks for an antidepressant that can be used in the treatment of nocturnal enuresis. Among the options provided, Imipramine is a tricyclic antidepressant known for its anticholinergic properties, which can help reduce bladder contractions and thus decrease episodes of bedwetting. This aligns with the standard medical practice of using tricyclic antidepressants for nocturnal enuresis. The other options, Fluvoxamine (an SSRI), Phenelzine (an MAOI), and Bupropion (an NDRI), do not have the same effect on bladder function and are not typically used for this condition. Therefore, based on the pharmacological properties and clinical use, Imipramine is the most appropriate choice for treating nocturnal enuresis.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
