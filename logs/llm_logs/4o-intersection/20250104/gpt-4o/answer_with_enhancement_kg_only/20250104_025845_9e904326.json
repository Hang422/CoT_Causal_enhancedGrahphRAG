Dexamethasone\nopb. Betamethasone\nopc. Hydrocoisone\nopd. Prednisolone\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nThe drug of choice for a pregnant female suspected of having a baby with congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) is Dexamethasone. This is based on the need to suppress fetal adrenal androgen production to prevent virilization in a female fetus, which is a risk in CAH, particularly due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency. Dexamethasone is effective because it crosses the placenta and directly suppresses fetal adrenal gland activity, thereby reducing excess androgen production. The retrieved evidence supports Dexamethasone's role in preventing virilism, aligning with the consensus that it is used for fetal treatment in CAH to reduce the risk of virilization. Other options like Betamethasone, Hydrocortisone, and Prednisolone are not typically used for this specific purpose in fetal treatment of CAH.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) is a group of genetic conditions limiting hormone production in the adrenal glands. The most common form is due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency, which can lead to excess androgen production and virilization in a female fetus. The goal of prenatal treatment is to suppress fetal adrenal androgen production to prevent this virilization. Dexamethasone is the drug of choice because it can cross the placenta and effectively suppress fetal adrenal activity, reducing androgen production. This aligns with the consensus in medical literature that Dexamethasone is used for this specific purpose. Other corticosteroids like Betamethasone, Hydrocortisone, and Prednisolone do not have the same efficacy in crossing the placenta or suppressing fetal adrenal function for this indication.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
