Amyloidosis associated with multiple myeloma has the poorest prognosis\nopb. Fine - needle biopsy of subcutaneous abdominal fat is a simple & reliable method for diagnosing secondary systemic amyloidosis\nopc. Hepatic amyloid disease produces hepatomegaly but rarely jaundice\nopd. Amyloidosis of the spleen is associated with severe anemia\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nOption opa: Amyloidosis associated with multiple myeloma is typically linked to AL amyloidosis, which indeed has a poor prognosis, aligning with consensus. Option opb: Fine-needle biopsy of subcutaneous abdominal fat is a well-established, simple, and reliable method for diagnosing systemic amyloidosis, including secondary forms, which is consistent with medical consensus. Option opc: Hepatic amyloid disease often results in hepatomegaly and rarely causes jaundice, which is a widely accepted fact. Option opd: While amyloidosis of the spleen can lead to anemia due to splenic involvement, the association with severe anemia is not strongly supported by consensus. The retrieved evidence path (Spleen)-LOCATION_OF->(Anemia) supports the potential for anemia but does not confirm severity, making option opd the least supported by consensus and likely the incorrect statement.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"In evaluating the statements regarding amyloidosis, we must consider the established medical knowledge and consensus. Option opa is consistent with the understanding that AL amyloidosis, often associated with multiple myeloma, has a poor prognosis. Option opb is supported by the fact that fine-needle biopsy of subcutaneous abdominal fat is a reliable diagnostic method for systemic amyloidosis, including secondary forms. Option opc aligns with the consensus that hepatic amyloid disease typically causes hepatomegaly but rarely jaundice. Option opd, however, lacks strong consensus support; while amyloidosis of the spleen can cause anemia, the specific claim of 'severe anemia' is not well-supported in the literature. Therefore, option opd is the most likely incorrect statement concerning amyloidosis.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}\n```",
