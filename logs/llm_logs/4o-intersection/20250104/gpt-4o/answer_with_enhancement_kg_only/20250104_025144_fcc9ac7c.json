Fatty acids\nopb. Ketone bodies\nopc. Glucose\nopd. Any of the above\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nIn normal conditions, the primary source of energy for cardiac muscle is fatty acids. Fatty acids undergo beta-oxidation, leading to ATP production, which is the main energy source for the heart, accounting for approximately 60-70% of its energy needs. Ketone bodies can also be oxidized to produce ATP, serving as a secondary energy source, especially during fasting or low-carbohydrate intake. Glucose is utilized through glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation, providing a lesser but significant portion of energy, particularly under conditions of increased workload or hypoxia. The option 'Any of the above' is technically correct as the heart can metabolize all these substrates for energy, but under normal conditions, fatty acids are predominant. The retrieved evidence path broadly supports the role of oxidation in ATP production, which is relevant to all these substrates but does not specify the primary source under normal conditions.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

This is because the heart is highly oxidative and relies on the efficient ATP production from fatty acid beta-oxidation, which accounts for approximately 60-70% of its energy needs. While ketone bodies and glucose can also be used as energy sources, they are secondary under normal conditions. Ketone bodies become more significant during fasting or low-carbohydrate intake, and glucose is more utilized during increased workload or hypoxic conditions.
