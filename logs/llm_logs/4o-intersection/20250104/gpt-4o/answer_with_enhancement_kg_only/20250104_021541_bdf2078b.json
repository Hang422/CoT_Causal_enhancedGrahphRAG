Protein C deficiency\nopb. Protein S deficiency\nopc. Hemophillia\nopd. Antithrombin III deficiency\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nWarfarin-induced skin necrosis is most commonly associated with Protein C deficiency. Warfarin administration leads to a rapid reduction in Protein C activity, which is a natural anticoagulant, resulting in a temporary hypercoagulable state. This can cause skin necrosis, particularly in individuals with an underlying Protein C deficiency. The reasoning chain for Protein C deficiency aligns with standard medical consensus and is supported by the evidence path indicating that Protein C deficiency can manifest as thrombophilia, which can lead to skin necrosis. While Protein S deficiency could theoretically contribute to a hypercoagulable state, it is less commonly associated with warfarin-induced skin necrosis. Hemophilia and Antithrombin III deficiency do not typically lead to skin necrosis in the context of warfarin administration, as warfarin does not significantly affect these conditions in a way that would cause such a complication.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Warfarin-induced skin necrosis is a rare but serious complication that occurs due to a paradoxical hypercoagulable state when warfarin is initiated. This is primarily because warfarin reduces the levels of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors, including Protein C, which is a natural anticoagulant. In individuals with Protein C deficiency, this reduction is more pronounced, leading to a temporary hypercoagulable state and subsequent skin necrosis. While Protein S deficiency could theoretically contribute to a similar state, it is less commonly associated with this specific complication. Hemophilia and Antithrombin III deficiency do not typically lead to skin necrosis in the context of warfarin use, as they do not involve the same mechanism of action. Therefore, the most likely correct answer, based on standard medical knowledge and consensus, is Protein C deficiency.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
