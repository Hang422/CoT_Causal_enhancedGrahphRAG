Increases liver glycogenolysis\nopb. Causes broachiolar constriction\nopc. Evokes extrasystoles in the heart\nopd. Produces restlessness and anxiety\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nEpinephrine, when administered intravenously in high doses, is known to increase liver glycogenolysis, leading to elevated blood glucose levels, which aligns with standard pharmacological consensus. It also evokes extrasystoles in the heart due to increased heart rate and produces restlessness and anxiety as a result of heightened sympathetic activity, both of which are well-documented effects. However, epinephrine typically causes bronchodilation rather than bronchiolar constriction, as it acts on beta-2 adrenergic receptors in the lungs to relax bronchial muscles. Therefore, the option stating that epinephrine causes bronchiolar constriction contradicts the consensus and is the correct answer to the question of which action is not associated with high-dose intravenous epinephrine.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Epinephrine, a catecholamine, primarily acts on alpha and beta adrenergic receptors. When administered in high doses intravenously, it is known to increase liver glycogenolysis (option opa) due to its action on beta-2 adrenergic receptors, leading to increased blood glucose levels. It can also evoke extrasystoles in the heart (option opc) by increasing heart rate and myocardial contractility through beta-1 adrenergic receptor stimulation. Additionally, epinephrine can produce restlessness and anxiety (option opd) as a result of heightened sympathetic nervous system activity. However, epinephrine typically causes bronchodilation, not bronchiolar constriction, as it acts on beta-2 adrenergic receptors in the lungs to relax bronchial muscles. Therefore, the statement that epinephrine causes bronchiolar constriction (option opb) is incorrect and does not align with the pharmacological consensus. This makes option opb the correct answer to the question of which action is not associated with high-dose intravenous epinephrine.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
