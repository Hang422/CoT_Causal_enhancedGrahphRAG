Ototoxicity\nopb. Nephrotoxicity\nopc. Coasting effect\nopd. Pulmonary fibrosis\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nCisplatin is well-documented to cause ototoxicity, leading to hearing loss, and nephrotoxicity, resulting in kidney damage, both of which are supported by standard medical consensus and the retrieved evidence paths. The 'coasting effect' refers to a delayed neuropathy that can occur with some chemotherapeutic agents, including cisplatin, but it is less commonly discussed and not as strongly associated as the other side effects. Pulmonary fibrosis is not a recognized side effect of cisplatin, and there is no strong evidence or consensus linking cisplatin to this condition. Therefore, the side effect not produced by cisplatin is pulmonary fibrosis.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "
