Proprioception\nopb. Vibratory sense\nopc. Heat sensation\nopd. Touch\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nThe dorsal column of the spinal cord is responsible for carrying proprioception, vibratory sense, and fine touch. These modalities are transmitted via the dorsal column-medial lemniscal pathway. Heat sensation, however, is not carried by the dorsal column; it is transmitted through the spinothalamic tract, which is responsible for carrying pain and temperature sensations. Therefore, the correct answer is that 'heat sensation' is not carried in the dorsal column of the spinal cord. The retrieved evidence path, while broad, does not directly address the specific sensory modalities carried by the dorsal column and is not necessary for this conclusion.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

These are carried via the dorsal column-medial lemniscal pathway. In contrast, heat sensation is transmitted through the spinothalamic tract, which is responsible for carrying pain and temperature sensations. Therefore, based on standard medical knowledge, heat sensation is not carried in the dorsal column of the spinal cord.
