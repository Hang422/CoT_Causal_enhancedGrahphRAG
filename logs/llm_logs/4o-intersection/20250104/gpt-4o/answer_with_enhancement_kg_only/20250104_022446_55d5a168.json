Spectrin\nopb. Ankyrin\nopc. Tubulin\nopd. Laminin\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nThe plasma membrane of a cell is connected to the cytoskeleton primarily through the interaction of spectrin and ankyrin. Spectrin is a cytoskeletal protein that binds to the plasma membrane, helping to stabilize cell shape. Ankyrin acts as an anchor, connecting spectrin to membrane proteins, thereby linking the cytoskeleton to the plasma membrane. This is supported by evidence showing spectrin's interaction with both cytoskeletal and membrane proteins. Tubulin, while a component of microtubules, does not directly bind to the plasma membrane, and its role is more structural within the cytoskeleton itself. Laminin is an extracellular matrix protein and does not directly participate in binding the cytoskeleton to the plasma membrane. Therefore, the most accurate connections are through spectrin and ankyrin, with ankyrin playing a crucial anchoring role.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The plasma membrane is connected to the cytoskeleton through a network of proteins that include spectrin and ankyrin. Spectrin is a cytoskeletal protein that forms a meshwork beneath the plasma membrane, providing structural support and maintaining cell shape. Ankyrin serves as an anchoring protein that links spectrin to integral membrane proteins, thereby facilitating the connection between the cytoskeleton and the plasma membrane. Tubulin is involved in forming microtubules, which are part of the cytoskeleton but do not directly bind to the plasma membrane. Laminin is an extracellular matrix protein and does not play a role in binding the cytoskeleton to the plasma membrane. Given this information, ankyrin is the key protein that directly anchors the cytoskeleton to the plasma membrane.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}",
