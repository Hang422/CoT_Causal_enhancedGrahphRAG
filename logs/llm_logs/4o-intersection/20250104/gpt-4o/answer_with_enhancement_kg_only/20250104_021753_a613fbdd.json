Adenylyl cyclase\nopc. Na+-K+-ATPase\nopd. Galactosyl transferase\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nIn evaluating enzymatic markers of the plasma membrane, standard consensus indicates: 5'-nucleotidase, adenylyl cyclase, and Na+-K+-ATPase are all associated with the plasma membrane and serve as markers for it. Galactosyl transferase, however, is primarily localized to the Golgi apparatus and is not considered a marker for the plasma membrane. The retrieved evidence path indicating the Golgi apparatus as part of the cell membrane is too broad and does not alter the consensus that galactosyl transferase is not a plasma membrane marker. Therefore, the correct answer is that galactosyl transferase is not an enzymatic marker of the plasma membrane.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"In determining enzymatic markers of the plasma membrane, it is essential to consider the localization and function of each enzyme. 5'-nucleotidase, adenylyl cyclase, and Na+-K+-ATPase are well-established markers of the plasma membrane due to their roles in nucleotide metabolism, signal transduction, and ion transport, respectively. Galactosyl transferase, on the other hand, is primarily associated with the Golgi apparatus, where it plays a role in glycosylation processes. This localization makes it unlikely to be a marker for the plasma membrane. Therefore, based on standard medical knowledge and consensus, galactosyl transferase is not considered an enzymatic marker of the plasma membrane.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
