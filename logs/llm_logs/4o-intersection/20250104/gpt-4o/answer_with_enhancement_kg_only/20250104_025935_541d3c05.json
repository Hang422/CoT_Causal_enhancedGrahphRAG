Chloroquine\nopb. Betamethasone\nopc. Chloramphenicol\nopd. Zidovudine\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nChloroquine is an antimalarial drug known to cause myopathy, supported by evidence linking antimalarials to myopathy. Betamethasone, a corticosteroid, can cause muscle weakness and potentially myopathy, but this is less common. Chloramphenicol, an antibiotic, has no known association with myopathy, making it the least likely to cause this condition. Zidovudine, an antiretroviral drug, is known to cause myopathy. Therefore, based on consensus and evidence, Chloramphenicol is the drug that does not cause myopathy.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "
