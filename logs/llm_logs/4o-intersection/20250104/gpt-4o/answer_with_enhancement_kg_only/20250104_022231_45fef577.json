Propanolol\nopb. Aiprazolam\nopc. Buspirone\nopd. Haloperidol\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nPropranolol is a beta-blocker that can be used off-label for anxiety, particularly for physical symptoms like tachycardia, but it is not primarily an anxiolytic. Alprazolam is a benzodiazepine, widely recognized and used for treating anxiety disorders. Buspirone is an anxiolytic specifically used for managing anxiety. Haloperidol is an antipsychotic and is not typically used for treating anxiety, aligning with the consensus that it is not an anxiolytic. The evidence paths confirm that benzodiazepines and anti-anxiety agents are used for anxiety, supporting the use of alprazolam and buspirone. The path for antipsychotic agents treating anxiety is too broad and not directly applicable to haloperidol's typical use, confirming it is not used for anxiety. Therefore, haloperidol is the drug not used for anxiety.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

Propranolol is used off-label to manage physical symptoms of anxiety, such as tachycardia. Alprazolam is a benzodiazepine, commonly prescribed for anxiety disorders. Buspirone is an anxiolytic specifically indicated for anxiety. Haloperidol, on the other hand, is an antipsychotic primarily used for treating schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders, and it is not typically used for anxiety.
