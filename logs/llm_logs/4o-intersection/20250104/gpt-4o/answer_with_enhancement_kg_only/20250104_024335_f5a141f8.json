Hyponatremia\nopb. Hyperkalemia\nopc. Hypoglycemia\nopd. Metabolic alkalosis\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nAdrenal insufficiency is characterized by decreased production of aldosterone and cortisol. This leads to hyponatremia due to decreased sodium reabsorption and hyperkalemia due to decreased potassium excretion, both of which are consistent with standard medical consensus. Additionally, decreased cortisol results in reduced gluconeogenesis, causing hypoglycemia. Metabolic acidosis, not alkalosis, is associated with adrenal insufficiency due to decreased hydrogen ion excretion. Therefore, metabolic alkalosis is not associated with adrenal insufficiency, aligning with the consensus that adrenal insufficiency typically leads to metabolic acidosis.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "
