It is a H2 blocker used in peptic ulcer disease\nopb. It has 100% Bioavailability\nopc. It also enhances gastric emptying\nopd. It can also lead to tachycardia\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nNizatidine is a histamine H2 receptor antagonist (H2 blocker) commonly used in the treatment of peptic ulcer disease, which aligns with standard medical consensus (Option A is true). It does not have 100% bioavailability; its bioavailability is typically around 70%, which contradicts Option B. There is no strong evidence or consensus to support that Nizatidine enhances gastric emptying, making Option C unlikely. While tachycardia is not a common side effect of Nizatidine, it can occur, but this is not a definitive characteristic of the drug, making Option D less likely. The retrieved evidence path confirms Nizatidine's classification as an H2 blocker but does not provide specific insights into its bioavailability, effects on gastric emptying, or side effects like tachycardia. Therefore, the statement that is not true about Nizatidine is that it has 100% bioavailability (Option B).\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "
