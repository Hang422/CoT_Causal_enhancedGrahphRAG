Vitamin B9\nopb. Vitamin B12\nopc. Vitamin B6\nopd. Vitamin B3\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nIsoniazid is known to interfere with pyridoxine (Vitamin B6) metabolism, leading to a deficiency in Vitamin B6. This is due to isoniazid's role as a pyridoxine antagonist, which can increase the excretion of pyridoxine and interfere with its absorption. The retrieved evidence paths support this by indicating that pyridoxine is associated with the treatment of Vitamin B6 deficiency and that isoniazid can lead to symptoms like peripheral neuropathy, which are manifestations of Vitamin B6 deficiency. Therefore, the most likely vitamin deficiency seen in patients on isoniazid is Vitamin B6 deficiency.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Isoniazid is an antibiotic commonly used in the treatment of tuberculosis. It is well-documented in medical literature that isoniazid can lead to a deficiency in Vitamin B6 (pyridoxine). This occurs because isoniazid acts as a pyridoxine antagonist, which can increase the excretion of pyridoxine and interfere with its absorption. The deficiency of Vitamin B6 can lead to symptoms such as peripheral neuropathy, which is why patients on isoniazid are often supplemented with Vitamin B6 to prevent these adverse effects. The enhanced information aligns with the standard medical consensus that Vitamin B6 deficiency is the most likely to occur in patients taking isoniazid.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opc\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
