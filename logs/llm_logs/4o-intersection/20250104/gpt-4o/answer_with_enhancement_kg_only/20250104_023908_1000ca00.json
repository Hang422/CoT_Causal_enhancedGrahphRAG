Stagnant hypoxia\nopb. Anemic hypoxia\nopc. Hypoxic hypoxia\nopd. Histotoxic hypoxia\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nShock primarily leads to stagnant hypoxia due to decreased blood flow and reduced oxygen delivery to tissues, which aligns with the consensus that shock results in impaired circulation. This is supported by the evidence path indicating that shock complicates blood circulation, leading to hypoxia. Anemic hypoxia can occur in shock due to blood loss and reduced hemoglobin levels, but it is less directly associated with shock compared to stagnant hypoxia. Hypoxic hypoxia, characterized by impaired oxygen delivery, is a broader category that can include stagnant hypoxia but is not specific to shock. Histotoxic hypoxia, where cells cannot utilize oxygen despite normal delivery, is not typically caused by shock, as shock primarily affects circulation rather than cellular oxygen utilization. Therefore, stagnant hypoxia is the most directly related to shock.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Shock is a condition characterized by inadequate blood flow to tissues, leading to insufficient oxygen delivery. This is primarily due to impaired circulation, which aligns with the concept of stagnant hypoxia. Stagnant hypoxia occurs when there is a reduction in blood flow, causing a decrease in oxygen delivery to tissues despite normal oxygen levels in the blood. Anemic hypoxia, while possible in cases of shock involving significant blood loss, is not the primary type of hypoxia associated with shock. Hypoxic hypoxia is a broader term that includes various causes of reduced oxygen delivery, but stagnant hypoxia is more specific to the circulatory issues seen in shock. Histotoxic hypoxia involves the inability of cells to utilize oxygen, which is not typically a direct result of shock. Therefore, based on standard medical knowledge and the enhanced information provided, stagnant hypoxia is the most directly related to shock.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}\n```",
