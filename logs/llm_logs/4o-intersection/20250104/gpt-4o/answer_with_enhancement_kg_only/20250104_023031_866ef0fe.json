It is more common with huminsulin\nopb. It may occur in the presence of infections\nopc. It may be due to antibodies to insulin\nopd. Use of glucocorticoids may be useful in severe cases\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nIn evaluating insulin resistance in diabetic patients, the following insights are aligned with medical consensus: (opa) Insulin resistance is not more common with 'huminsulin' as it is a standard insulin type without increased resistance risk. (opb) Infections can lead to an inflammatory response, which is known to increase insulin resistance, supported by evidence linking inflammation to insulin resistance. (opc) The presence of antibodies to insulin can bind to insulin, reducing its effectiveness and thereby increasing insulin resistance. (opd) The use of glucocorticoids is not advisable in managing insulin resistance as they typically increase blood glucose levels and worsen insulin resistance. Therefore, the statement that glucocorticoids may be useful in severe cases is incorrect.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"In evaluating the statements regarding insulin resistance in diabetic patients, we consider the following: (opa) 'Huminsulin' is a type of human insulin and does not inherently lead to increased insulin resistance compared to other insulin types. (opb) Infections can indeed exacerbate insulin resistance due to the inflammatory response they trigger. (opc) Antibodies to insulin can interfere with insulin action, leading to increased resistance. (opd) Glucocorticoids are known to increase blood glucose levels and can worsen insulin resistance, making their use counterproductive in managing insulin resistance. Therefore, the statement that glucocorticoids may be useful in severe cases is incorrect. Based on this analysis, the most likely correct answer is that glucocorticoids are not useful in managing insulin resistance, making option 'opd' the exception.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
