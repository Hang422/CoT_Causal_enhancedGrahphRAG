Penicillin G\nopb. Tetracycline\nopc. Azithromycin\nopd. Doxycycline\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nTreponema pallidum is the bacterium that causes syphilis. The standard medical consensus is that Penicillin G is the drug of choice for treating syphilis due to its high efficacy and established use. Tetracycline and Doxycycline are considered alternative treatments, primarily used when a patient has a penicillin allergy, but they are less effective than Penicillin G. Azithromycin has been used in some cases, but concerns about resistance make it not a first-line treatment. The retrieved evidence path broadly associates syphilis with bacterial infections and pharmaceutical preparations, which supports the context of using antibiotics like Penicillin G for treatment. Therefore, Penicillin G remains the preferred treatment option for syphilis.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "
