Pyrazinamide\nopb. Isoniazid\nopc. Ethambutol\nopd. Rifampicin\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nIn a HIV positive patient on zidovudine, lamivudine, and indinavir therapy who develops TB, Rifampicin should be avoided. Rifampicin is a potent inducer of cytochrome P450 enzymes, which can significantly decrease the plasma levels of protease inhibitors like indinavir, leading to reduced efficacy of HIV therapy. This interaction is well-documented and aligns with standard medical consensus. The other anti-tubercular drugs, Pyrazinamide, Isoniazid, and Ethambutol, do not have significant interactions with the mentioned HIV medications and are generally considered safe to use in this context. The retrieved evidence paths, while broad, support the understanding that cytochrome P450 interactions are critical in this scenario, confirming the need to avoid Rifampicin to maintain effective HIV treatment.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"In patients with HIV who are on antiretroviral therapy, drug interactions are a critical consideration. Rifampicin is known to be a potent inducer of cytochrome P450 enzymes, which can lead to decreased plasma levels of protease inhibitors such as indinavir. This interaction can significantly reduce the efficacy of the HIV treatment regimen. Therefore, in a patient on zidovudine, lamivudine, and indinavir, Rifampicin should be avoided to prevent compromising the effectiveness of the HIV therapy. The other anti-tubercular drugs listed (Pyrazinamide, Isoniazid, and Ethambutol) do not have significant interactions with the mentioned HIV medications and are generally considered safe to use. This aligns with standard medical consensus and supports the decision to avoid Rifampicin in this scenario.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
