Atrial flutter\nopb. Parkinsonian tremor\nopc. Thyrotoxicosis\nopd. HOCM\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nPropranolol, a non-selective beta-blocker, is effective in managing atrial flutter by decreasing heart rate and controlling arrhythmias, aligning with standard medical consensus. It is also beneficial in thyrotoxicosis by reducing sympathetic overactivity, which helps control symptoms. However, propranolol is not typically used for Parkinsonian tremor, as it is more effective for essential tremor, and its role in Parkinson's disease is limited and not well-supported by evidence. In hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM), propranolol can potentially worsen outflow obstruction due to its negative inotropic effects, making it less suitable for this condition. Therefore, propranolol is useful in all except Parkinsonian tremor, where its efficacy is not established.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

It is commonly used in atrial flutter to control heart rate and arrhythmias, and in thyrotoxicosis to manage symptoms by reducing sympathetic overactivity. In hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM), propranolol can be used to manage symptoms by reducing heart rate and contractility, although care must be taken due to its potential to worsen outflow obstruction. However, propranolol is not typically used for Parkinsonian tremor. While it is effective for essential tremor, its role in Parkinson's disease is limited and not well-supported by evidence. Therefore, the most likely correct answer is that propranolol is not useful for Parkinsonian tremor.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}",
