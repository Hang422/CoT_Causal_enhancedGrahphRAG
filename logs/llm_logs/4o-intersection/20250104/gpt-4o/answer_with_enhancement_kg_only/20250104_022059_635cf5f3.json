Drug implicated is?\n\n                    ### Options\n                    opa. Streptomycin\nopb. Isoniazid\nopc. Ethambutol\nopd. Rifampicin\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nStreptomycin is the most likely anti-tubercular drug implicated in causing deafness and tinnitus. This is supported by the consensus that streptomycin is known to cause ototoxicity, which can lead to symptoms such as deafness and tinnitus. The evidence paths confirm this association, showing that streptomycin is linked to ototoxicity, a known cause of these auditory symptoms. In contrast, isoniazid is primarily associated with peripheral neuropathy, ethambutol with optic neuritis, and rifampicin with hepatotoxicity, none of which directly cause deafness or tinnitus. Therefore, based on the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence, streptomycin is the drug most likely responsible for the patient's symptoms.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The core medical principle here involves understanding the side effects associated with anti-tubercular drugs. Streptomycin is an aminoglycoside antibiotic used in the treatment of tuberculosis and is well-documented to cause ototoxicity, which can manifest as deafness and tinnitus. This is due to its effect on the auditory nerve and inner ear structures. In contrast, isoniazid is more commonly associated with peripheral neuropathy, ethambutol with optic neuritis, and rifampicin with hepatotoxicity. Given the symptoms of deafness and tinnitus, streptomycin is the most likely drug implicated. This aligns with the enhanced information provided, which supports the consensus that streptomycin is linked to these auditory symptoms.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
