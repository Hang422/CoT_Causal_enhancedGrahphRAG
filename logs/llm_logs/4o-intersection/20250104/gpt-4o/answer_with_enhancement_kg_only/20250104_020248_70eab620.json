Acute renal failure\nopb. Development of antiplatelet antibodies\nopc. Encephalitis secondary to liver dysfunction\nopd. Hemorrhagic stroke\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nFibrinolytic drugs, used in the treatment of acute myocardial infarction, work by dissolving blood clots through the activation of plasminogen to form plasmin, which degrades fibrin. This systemic fibrinolysis increases the risk of bleeding complications, with hemorrhagic stroke being a significant adverse effect. The retrieved evidence supports this by linking fibrinolytic agents to hemorrhage and hemorrhagic stroke, confirming the consensus that the most likely adverse effect of fibrinolytic therapy is hemorrhagic stroke due to increased bleeding risk. Other options, such as acute renal failure, development of antiplatelet antibodies, and encephalitis secondary to liver dysfunction, are not commonly associated with fibrinolytic therapy.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Fibrinolytic drugs, such as tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), are used to dissolve clots in the treatment of acute myocardial infarction. The primary mechanism involves converting plasminogen to plasmin, which breaks down fibrin clots. This systemic action increases the risk of bleeding, with hemorrhagic stroke being a well-documented and significant adverse effect. The other options, such as acute renal failure, development of antiplatelet antibodies, and encephalitis secondary to liver dysfunction, are not typically associated with the use of fibrinolytic drugs. Therefore, based on standard medical knowledge and consensus, the most likely adverse effect of fibrinolytic therapy is hemorrhagic stroke.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
