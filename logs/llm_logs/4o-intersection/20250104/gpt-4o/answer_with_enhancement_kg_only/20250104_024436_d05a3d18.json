Leydig cells\nopb. Seolie cells\nopc. Seminiferous tubules\nopd. Epididymis\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nTestosterone production is primarily attributed to Leydig cells, which are located in the interstitial tissue of the testes. This aligns with the consensus that Leydig cells are the main source of testosterone production. The evidence path indicating the 'Structure of interstitial cell of Leydig' being the 'LOCATION_OF' testosterone supports this consensus. The other options, such as Sertoli cells (misinterpreted as 'Seolie cells'), seminiferous tubules, and the epididymis, are not primarily involved in testosterone production. Sertoli cells are involved in nurturing sperm cells, seminiferous tubules are the site of sperm production, and the epididymis is involved in sperm maturation, none of which are directly responsible for testosterone synthesis.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Testosterone production in the male body is primarily attributed to the Leydig cells, which are located in the interstitial tissue of the testes. These cells are responsible for synthesizing and secreting testosterone, a key hormone in male reproductive physiology. The other options provided do not primarily contribute to testosterone production: Sertoli cells (misinterpreted as 'Seolie cells') are involved in supporting and nurturing developing sperm cells, seminiferous tubules are the site of spermatogenesis, and the epididymis is involved in the maturation and storage of sperm. Therefore, based on standard medical knowledge and the enhanced information provided, Leydig cells are the main contributors to testosterone production.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 100\n}",
