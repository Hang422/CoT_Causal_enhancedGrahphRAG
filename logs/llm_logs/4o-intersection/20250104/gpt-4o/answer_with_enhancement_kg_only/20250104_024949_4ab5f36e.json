Flutamide\nopb. Finasteride\nopc. Prazosin\nopd. Minoxidil\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nFinasteride is a 5α reductase inhibitor that effectively treats both benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH) and male pattern baldness. It works by inhibiting the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT), leading to reduced prostate size and improved BPH symptoms, as well as decreased hair follicle miniaturization, which improves male pattern baldness. Flutamide, an androgen receptor blocker, may affect prostate size but has unclear effects on hair. Prazosin, an alpha-1 adrenergic receptor blocker, improves urinary symptoms in BPH but does not affect hair. Minoxidil, a vasodilator, increases blood flow to hair follicles, improving male pattern baldness but has no effect on the prostate. The evidence paths confirm the mechanisms of action for these drugs, particularly highlighting the role of DHT in both BPH and hair loss, supporting the consensus that Finasteride is effective for both conditions.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The question asks for a 5α reductase inhibitor effective in treating both benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH) and male pattern baldness. Finasteride is well-documented in medical literature as a 5α reductase inhibitor that reduces the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT). This reduction in DHT levels leads to decreased prostate size and improved symptoms in BPH, as well as reduced hair follicle miniaturization, which is beneficial in treating male pattern baldness. The other options do not fit the criteria: Flutamide is an androgen receptor blocker, Prazosin is an alpha-1 adrenergic receptor blocker, and Minoxidil is a vasodilator. Therefore, based on the mechanism of action and clinical use, Finasteride is the most likely correct answer.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
