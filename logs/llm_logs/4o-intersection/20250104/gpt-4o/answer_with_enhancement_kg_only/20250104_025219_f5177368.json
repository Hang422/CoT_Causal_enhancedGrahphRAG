Retinol\nopb. Retinal\nopc. Retinoic acids\nopd. All of the above\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nVitamin A functions are related to all the listed forms: Retinol, Retinal, and Retinoic acids. Retinol is a form of vitamin A that supports vision and immune function. Retinal is essential for vision, particularly in the conversion of light into signals in the retina. Retinoic acids are involved in regulating gene expression, which is crucial for cell differentiation and growth. The evidence paths confirm that vitamin A and its derivatives are part of cellular processes in the retina, supporting their roles in vision and cellular function. Therefore, the correct answer is that vitamin A is related to all of the above forms.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Vitamin A is a fat-soluble vitamin that plays crucial roles in various physiological processes. It exists in several forms, including retinol, retinal, and retinoic acids, each contributing to different functions. Retinol is involved in vision and immune function, retinal is critical for vision by participating in the conversion of light into neural signals in the retina, and retinoic acids are important for regulating gene expression, affecting cell differentiation and growth. The enhanced information aligns with standard medical knowledge, confirming that vitamin A functions are related to all these forms. Therefore, the most likely correct answer is that vitamin A is related to all of the above forms.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
