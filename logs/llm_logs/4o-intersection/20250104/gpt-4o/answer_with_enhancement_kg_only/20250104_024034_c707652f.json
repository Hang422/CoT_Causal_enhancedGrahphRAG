Chlorothiazide\nopb. Beta blockers\nopc. ACE inhibitors\nopd. Amlodipine\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nSpironolactone is a potassium-sparing diuretic that can lead to increased potassium levels. ACE inhibitors also increase potassium levels, and their concurrent use with spironolactone can significantly raise the risk of hyperkalemia, making this combination contraindicated. Chlorothiazide, a thiazide diuretic, promotes potassium excretion, which may counterbalance spironolactone's effect on potassium, thus not contraindicated. Beta blockers and amlodipine do not have a direct effect on potassium levels and are not contraindicated with spironolactone. The evidence paths confirm spironolactone's role in potassium retention but do not provide additional relevant information for the other options. Therefore, ACE inhibitors are contraindicated with spironolactone due to the risk of hyperkalemia.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Spironolactone is a potassium-sparing diuretic, which means it can lead to increased potassium levels in the body. ACE inhibitors also have the potential to increase potassium levels. When used together, spironolactone and ACE inhibitors can significantly increase the risk of hyperkalemia, a condition characterized by elevated potassium levels that can be dangerous. This makes the combination of spironolactone and ACE inhibitors contraindicated. Chlorothiazide, on the other hand, is a thiazide diuretic that promotes potassium excretion, which can counteract the potassium-retaining effect of spironolactone, making it not contraindicated. Beta blockers and amlodipine do not have a direct effect on potassium levels and are generally considered safe to use with spironolactone. Therefore, based on standard medical knowledge and consensus, the most likely correct answer is that ACE inhibitors are contraindicated with spironolactone.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opc\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
