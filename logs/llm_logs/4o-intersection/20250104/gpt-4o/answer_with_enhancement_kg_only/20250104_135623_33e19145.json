HGPRTase\nopb. Adenosine deaminase\nopc. APRTase\nopd. Acid maltase\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nIn evaluating the potential enzyme deficiencies in the child, we consider the following: HGPRTase deficiency is associated with the accumulation of uric acid, leading to gout-like symptoms and neurological issues, which aligns with known symptoms of Lesch-Nyhan syndrome. Adenosine deaminase deficiency results in the accumulation of toxic metabolites causing severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) and recurrent infections, which is well-documented. APRTase deficiency leads to the accumulation of adenine and the formation of 2,8-dihydroxyadenine stones, resulting in kidney stones, a recognized condition. Acid maltase deficiency, also known as Pompe disease, causes glycogen accumulation in lysosomes, leading to muscle weakness and cardiomyopathy. The retrieved evidence paths mention lysosomes and cardiomyopathy, which are relevant to acid maltase deficiency, but the paths are too broad to directly support any specific enzyme deficiency in this context. Therefore, based on the symptoms described, HGPRTase deficiency is most likely, given the neurological symptoms and potential for gout-like manifestations.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

HGPRTase deficiency is linked to Lesch-Nyhan syndrome, characterized by neurological issues and gout-like symptoms due to uric acid accumulation. Adenosine deaminase deficiency leads to severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) with recurrent infections. APRTase deficiency results in kidney stones due to 2,8-dihydroxyadenine accumulation. Acid maltase deficiency, or Pompe disease, causes glycogen accumulation in lysosomes, leading to muscle weakness and cardiomyopathy. Given the context provided, the symptoms of neurological issues and potential gout-like manifestations align most closely with HGPRTase deficiency.
