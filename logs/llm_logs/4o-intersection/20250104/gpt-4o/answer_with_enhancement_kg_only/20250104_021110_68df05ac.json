Outer hair cells in basal area\nopb. Inner hair cells in basal area\nopc. Outer hair cells in apical area\nopd. Inner hair cells in apical area\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nAminoglycosides are known to cause ototoxicity, primarily affecting the cochlear hair cells. The consensus in medical literature is that aminoglycosides predominantly damage the outer hair cells, particularly in the basal area of the cochlea. This is because the basal area is responsible for high-frequency sound detection, which is often the first to be affected in ototoxicity. The evidence paths confirm the association between aminoglycosides and ototoxicity but do not provide specific insights into the location of damage within the cochlea. Therefore, the most supported conclusion is that aminoglycosides affect the outer hair cells in the basal area.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "
