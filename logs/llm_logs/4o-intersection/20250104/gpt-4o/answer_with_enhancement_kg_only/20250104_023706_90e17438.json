Fever\nopb. Peptic ulcer\nopc. Unstable angina\nopd. Myalgia\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nAspirin is contraindicated in peptic ulcer disease due to its inhibition of prostaglandins, which reduces gastric mucosal protection and increases the risk of gastric bleeding. This aligns with the consensus that aspirin's antiplatelet effect can exacerbate bleeding risks in peptic ulcers. The evidence paths support this by showing aspirin's interaction with prostaglandins and its antiplatelet properties. Aspirin is not contraindicated in fever, as it has an antipyretic effect that helps manage fever. It is also not contraindicated in myalgia, where its anti-inflammatory properties can be beneficial. In unstable angina, aspirin's antiplatelet effect is beneficial for preventing clot formation, making it a recommended treatment rather than a contraindication.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Aspirin is known to inhibit the production of prostaglandins, which play a crucial role in protecting the gastric mucosa. This inhibition can lead to increased gastric acid secretion and reduced mucosal protection, heightening the risk of gastric bleeding and ulceration. Therefore, aspirin is contraindicated in individuals with peptic ulcer disease due to the potential for exacerbating bleeding risks. In contrast, aspirin is not contraindicated in conditions like fever, myalgia, or unstable angina. In fact, it is often used therapeutically in these conditions: it has antipyretic effects for fever, anti-inflammatory effects for myalgia, and antiplatelet effects that are beneficial in managing unstable angina. Based on this understanding, the most likely correct answer is that aspirin is contraindicated in peptic ulcer disease.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
