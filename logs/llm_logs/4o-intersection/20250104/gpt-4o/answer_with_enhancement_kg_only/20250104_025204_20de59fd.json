Vitamin A\nopb. Vitamin K\nopc. Vitamin E\nopd. Vitamin D\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nVitamin K is the only fat-soluble vitamin among the options that functions as a coenzyme. It plays a crucial role in the gamma-carboxylation of glutamic acid residues on certain proteins required for blood coagulation, acting as a coenzyme in this process. The retrieved evidence paths support this by associating Vitamin K with blood coagulation factors, confirming its role in coagulation. In contrast, Vitamin A is involved in vision and skin health, Vitamin E acts as an antioxidant protecting cell membranes, and Vitamin D is important for calcium homeostasis and bone health. None of these other vitamins function as coenzymes. Therefore, Vitamin K is the correct answer.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The question asks which fat-soluble vitamin functions as a coenzyme. Among the options, Vitamin K is well-documented to act as a coenzyme. It is essential for the gamma-carboxylation of glutamic acid residues on proteins involved in blood coagulation, such as prothrombin. This role is unique among the fat-soluble vitamins listed. Vitamin A is primarily involved in vision and epithelial health, Vitamin E serves as an antioxidant, and Vitamin D is crucial for calcium metabolism and bone health. None of these other vitamins have a coenzyme function. Therefore, based on standard medical knowledge and the enhanced information provided, Vitamin K is the correct answer.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
