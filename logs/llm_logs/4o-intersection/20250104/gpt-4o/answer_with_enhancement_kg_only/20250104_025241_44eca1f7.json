Tamsulosin\nopb. Prazosin\nopc. Oxazocin\nopd. Dolazoline\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nTamsulosin and Prazosin are both alpha-1 adrenergic blockers that provide symptomatic relief in benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) by relaxing smooth muscle in the prostate, thereby improving urine flow. Tamsulosin is particularly well-known and widely used for this purpose, with a high efficacy rate. Oxazocin, while also an alpha-1 adrenergic blocker, is less commonly used and has a lower efficacy rate for BPH symptom relief. Dolazoline does not have a clear mechanism or established efficacy in treating BPH symptoms, making it an unsuitable choice. The evidence path regarding urine flow and BPH symptoms supports the mechanism of action for alpha-1 blockers like Tamsulosin and Prazosin, confirming their role in improving urinary symptoms associated with BPH.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"In the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), alpha-1 adrenergic blockers are commonly used to provide symptomatic relief by relaxing the smooth muscle in the prostate and bladder neck, thereby improving urine flow. Among the options provided, Tamsulosin (opa) and Prazosin (opb) are both alpha-1 adrenergic blockers known for their efficacy in treating BPH symptoms. However, Tamsulosin is particularly well-known and widely used for this purpose due to its high efficacy and favorable side effect profile. Prazosin is less commonly used for BPH, and Oxazocin and Dolazoline are not standard treatments for BPH. Therefore, based on standard medical knowledge and consensus, Tamsulosin is the most likely correct answer for providing symptomatic relief in BPH.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
