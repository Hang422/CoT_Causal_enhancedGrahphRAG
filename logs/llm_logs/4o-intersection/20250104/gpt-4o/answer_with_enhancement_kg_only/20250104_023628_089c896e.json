He has a history of being treated for duodenal ulcer 4 years back. Investigation reveals elevation of gastrin levels. Which of the following statement is true regarding gastrin?\n\n                    ### Options\n                    opa. Secreted by parietal cells of stomach\nopb. Secreted by alpha ceils of pancreas\nopc. Decreases bicarbonate content in pancreatic secretion\nopd. It gets stimulated by endoluminal peptides in stomach\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nGastrin is a hormone secreted by G cells in the stomach, not by parietal cells or alpha cells of the pancreas. It is stimulated by peptides in the stomach, which aligns with the consensus that gastrin is released in response to the presence of peptides and amino acids in the gastric lumen. This stimulation leads to increased gastric acid secretion, not a decrease in bicarbonate content. The evidence paths confirm that gastrin interacts with cells in the stomach and is part of the gastric system, supporting the consensus that it is not associated with the pancreas or its alpha cells. Therefore, the correct statement regarding gastrin is that it gets stimulated by endoluminal peptides in the stomach.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Gastrin is a hormone primarily secreted by G cells located in the antrum of the stomach. It plays a crucial role in stimulating gastric acid secretion by the parietal cells of the stomach. The secretion of gastrin is stimulated by the presence of peptides and amino acids in the stomach, which are products of protein digestion. This aligns with the consensus that gastrin is released in response to endoluminal peptides. The other options are incorrect: gastrin is not secreted by parietal cells or alpha cells of the pancreas, and it does not decrease bicarbonate content in pancreatic secretion. Therefore, the most accurate statement regarding gastrin is that it gets stimulated by endoluminal peptides in the stomach.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
