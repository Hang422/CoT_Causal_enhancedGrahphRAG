Erythromycin\nopb. Benzene hexachloride\nopc. Piperazine\nopd. Thiabendazole\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nScabies is a skin infestation caused by the mite Sarcoptes scabiei. The standard treatment for scabies involves topical scabicides. Erythromycin is an antibiotic effective against bacterial infections, not scabies, and thus is not suitable for this condition. Benzene hexachloride, also known as Lindane, is a topical treatment specifically used to kill scabies mites, making it an effective treatment for scabies. Piperazine and Thiabendazole are anthelmintics used to treat worm infections and are not effective against scabies mites. Therefore, the correct treatment for scabies is Benzene hexachloride (Lindane).\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "
