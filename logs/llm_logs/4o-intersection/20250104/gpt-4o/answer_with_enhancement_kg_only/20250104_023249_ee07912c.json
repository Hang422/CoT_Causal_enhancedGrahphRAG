Cinchonism\nopb. Hyperglycemia\nopc. Hypoglycemia\nopd. Hypokalemia\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nQuinine is known to cause hypoglycemia due to increased insulin secretion, which can lead to symptoms such as sweating and palpitation. This aligns with the consensus that hypoglycemia is a likely cause of these symptoms in patients treated with quinine. While quinine can have cardiac effects, leading to palpitations, cinchonism typically involves tinnitus, headache, and dizziness rather than sweating and palpitation. Hypokalemia is less commonly associated with quinine and would more likely cause muscle weakness or cramps rather than sweating. Hyperglycemia is not a typical effect of quinine. Therefore, the most consensus-supported explanation for the symptoms of sweating and palpitation in this context is hypoglycemia.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Quinine is a medication used to treat falciparum malaria, and it is known to cause hypoglycemia due to its effect of increasing insulin secretion. The symptoms of sweating and palpitation are consistent with hypoglycemia, as these are common autonomic responses to low blood sugar levels. Cinchonism, another side effect of quinine, typically presents with symptoms such as tinnitus, headache, and dizziness, rather than sweating and palpitation. Hypokalemia, while it can cause palpitations, is not commonly associated with quinine and would more likely cause muscle weakness or cramps. Hyperglycemia is not a known effect of quinine. Therefore, based on the consensus and the symptoms presented, hypoglycemia is the most likely cause of the sweating and palpitation in this patient.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opc\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}\n```",
