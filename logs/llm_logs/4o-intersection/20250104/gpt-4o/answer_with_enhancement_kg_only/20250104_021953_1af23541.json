Carbamazepine\nopb. Vigabatrin\nopc. Sodium valproate\nopd. Lamotrigine\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nCarbamazepine, sodium valproate, and lamotrigine are all well-established mood stabilizers used in the treatment of bipolar disorder, aligning with standard medical consensus. Vigabatrin, on the other hand, primarily functions by inhibiting GABA transaminase, leading to increased GABA levels, but it is not typically used for mood stabilization or the treatment of bipolar disorder. The retrieved evidence path confirms Vigabatrin's mechanism of action related to GABA but does not support its use in bipolar disorder treatment. Therefore, Vigabatrin is the drug not indicated for bipolar disorder among the options provided.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"In the treatment of bipolar disorder, mood stabilizers such as carbamazepine, sodium valproate, and lamotrigine are commonly used and well-supported by medical consensus. These drugs help manage mood swings and stabilize mood in patients with bipolar disorder. Vigabatrin, however, is primarily used as an antiepileptic drug and works by inhibiting GABA transaminase, which increases GABA levels in the brain. It is not indicated for the treatment of bipolar disorder. Therefore, based on standard medical knowledge and the enhanced information provided, Vigabatrin is the drug not indicated for bipolar disorder among the options given.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
