None of the above\nopb. Albumin\nopc. Globulins\nopd. Chylomicrons\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nFree fatty acids are transported in the blood bound to albumin, which is a well-established consensus in biochemistry. Albumin acts as a carrier for free fatty acids, facilitating their transport to cells where they can enter mitochondria for oxidation. Globulins primarily transport hormones and vitamins, not free fatty acids, and chylomicrons are involved in the transport of dietary lipids from the intestines, not free fatty acids in the bloodstream. The retrieved evidence paths confirm that albumins are associated with the transport of nonesterified fatty acids, supporting the consensus that albumin is the correct carrier for free fatty acids in the blood. Therefore, the correct option is that free fatty acids are transported by albumin.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "
