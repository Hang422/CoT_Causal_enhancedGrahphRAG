Which of the following enzymes is defective?\n\n                    ### Options\n                    opa. Fructokinase\nopb. Aldolase A\nopc. Aldolase B\nopd. Sucrase\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nThe symptoms of vomiting, lethargy, and severe jaundice in a 6-month-old baby after weaning with fruit juice suggest a defect in fructose metabolism. The most likely enzyme deficiency is Aldolase B, which is crucial for the breakdown of fructose-1-phosphate. A deficiency in Aldolase B leads to the accumulation of toxic metabolites, causing the observed symptoms. This aligns with the consensus that Aldolase B deficiency, known as Hereditary Fructose Intolerance, results in severe symptoms upon fructose ingestion. Fructokinase deficiency, while related to fructose metabolism, typically results in benign symptoms and is unlikely to cause severe jaundice. Aldolase A is not primarily involved in fructose metabolism, and sucrase is unrelated to fructose metabolism. The retrieved evidence paths regarding fructokinase deficiency are not directly relevant to the severe symptoms observed in this case.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The symptoms presented by the 6-month-old baby—vomiting, lethargy, and severe jaundice upon introduction of fruit juice—are indicative of a defect in fructose metabolism. The key enzyme involved in the metabolism of fructose-1-phosphate is Aldolase B. A deficiency in Aldolase B leads to the condition known as Hereditary Fructose Intolerance (HFI), which results in the accumulation of fructose-1-phosphate and subsequent toxic effects, including the symptoms observed. Fructokinase deficiency, while also related to fructose metabolism, typically causes benign symptoms such as fructosuria and does not lead to severe jaundice or lethargy. Aldolase A is primarily involved in glycolysis and not directly in fructose metabolism, and sucrase is involved in sucrose digestion, not fructose. Therefore, the most likely enzyme deficiency causing these symptoms is Aldolase B.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opc\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
