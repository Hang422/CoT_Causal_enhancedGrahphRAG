Stomach\nopb. Duodenum\nopc. Ileum\nopd. Duodenum + Jejunum\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nIron is primarily absorbed in the duodenum, which is the major site of iron absorption in the human body. This is supported by the evidence path showing the interaction of iron with SLC11A2, a transporter involved in iron uptake, which is part of the duodenum. While there is some absorption in the jejunum, it is not the primary site. The stomach is not a significant site for iron absorption, as indicated by the minimal absorption noted in the reasoning chain. The ileum is also not a primary site for iron absorption. Therefore, the most accurate answer is that iron is absorbed in the duodenum.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Iron absorption primarily occurs in the duodenum, which is the first part of the small intestine immediately following the stomach. This is where the majority of dietary iron is absorbed, facilitated by specific transporters such as SLC11A2. While some iron absorption can occur in the jejunum, it is not the primary site. The stomach and ileum are not significant sites for iron absorption. Therefore, based on standard medical knowledge and consensus, the duodenum is the most accurate answer for the primary site of iron absorption.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
