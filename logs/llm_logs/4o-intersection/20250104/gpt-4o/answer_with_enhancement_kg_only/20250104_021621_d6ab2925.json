Methimazole\nopb. Propylthiouraril\nopc. Carbimazole\nopd. Perchlorate\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nIn the management of hyperthyroidism during the first trimester of pregnancy, the standard medical consensus is to prefer Propylthiouracil (PTU) due to its lower placental transfer and reduced risk of fetal abnormalities compared to Methimazole and Carbimazole. Methimazole and Carbimazole, which is metabolized to Methimazole, are associated with a higher risk of fetal abnormalities and are generally avoided in the first trimester. Perchlorate is not commonly used due to potential fetal harm and is not preferred in pregnancy. The retrieved evidence path involving Carbimazole and Methimazole confirms the metabolic relationship but does not alter the consensus that PTU is the preferred choice in the first trimester.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"In the management of hyperthyroidism during the first trimester of pregnancy, the primary concern is minimizing the risk of fetal abnormalities. Methimazole and Carbimazole are associated with teratogenic effects, particularly when used in the first trimester. Propylthiouracil (PTU) is preferred during this period because it has a lower risk of crossing the placenta and causing fetal harm. Perchlorate is not commonly used due to its potential for fetal harm and is not recommended in pregnancy. Therefore, based on standard medical knowledge and consensus, Propylthiouracil is the drug of choice for treating hyperthyroidism in the first trimester of pregnancy.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
