It follows zero order kinetics\nopb. Not an hepatic enzyme inducer\nopc. It is excreted unchanged in urine\nopd. It is not teratogenic\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nPhenytoin is known to follow zero-order kinetics at therapeutic and higher concentrations, meaning it is eliminated at a constant rate due to saturation of metabolic pathways. It is a hepatic enzyme inducer, which increases the metabolism of other drugs. Phenytoin is primarily metabolized in the liver and is not excreted unchanged in the urine. It is also teratogenic, posing a risk of fetal malformations. The retrieved evidence supports its teratogenic effects, aligning with the consensus that phenytoin can cause teratogenesis.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

This is due to the saturation of its metabolic pathways. Phenytoin is also a hepatic enzyme inducer, which means it can increase the metabolism of other drugs by inducing liver enzymes. It is primarily metabolized in the liver and not excreted unchanged in the urine. Additionally, phenytoin is teratogenic, meaning it can cause fetal malformations if taken during pregnancy.
