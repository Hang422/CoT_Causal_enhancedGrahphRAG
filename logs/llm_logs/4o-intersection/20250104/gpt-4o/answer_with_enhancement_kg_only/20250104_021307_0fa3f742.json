Thiamine\nopb. Pyridoxine\nopc. Niacin\nopd. Riboflavin\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nIsoniazid (INH) is known to interfere with pyridoxine (vitamin B6) metabolism, leading to pyridoxine deficiency. This deficiency can result in peripheral neuropathy, a condition characterized by nerve damage and associated symptoms. The standard treatment for INH-induced neuropathy is supplementation with pyridoxine, which replenishes the depleted vitamin levels and helps restore nerve function, thereby alleviating symptoms. The retrieved evidence paths support this by indicating that pyridoxine treats neuropathy and is associated with the effects of isoniazid. Therefore, the correct treatment for INH-induced neuropathy is pyridoxine supplementation.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Isoniazid (INH) is an antibiotic commonly used in the treatment of tuberculosis. A known side effect of INH is peripheral neuropathy, which occurs due to its interference with pyridoxine (vitamin B6) metabolism. This interference can lead to a deficiency in pyridoxine, which is essential for nerve function. The standard medical treatment for INH-induced neuropathy is supplementation with pyridoxine. This approach is well-supported by medical consensus, as it directly addresses the underlying cause of the neuropathy by replenishing the depleted vitamin B6 levels. Other vitamins such as thiamine, niacin, and riboflavin are not directly involved in the mechanism of INH-induced neuropathy, making pyridoxine the most appropriate treatment option.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
