Androgen binding protein\nopb. Testosterone\nopc. LH\nopd. FSH\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nSertoli cells are known to secrete androgen-binding protein (ABP), which binds testosterone to maintain high levels of testosterone in the seminiferous tubules, supporting spermatogenesis. This aligns with the consensus that Sertoli cells do not secrete testosterone; instead, testosterone is produced by Leydig cells under the stimulation of LH. Sertoli cells respond to FSH, which supports spermatogenesis, but they do not secrete FSH or LH. The evidence paths confirm that androgen-binding proteins interact with testosterone, supporting the role of Sertoli cells in maintaining testosterone levels. Additionally, LH interacts with Leydig cells to stimulate testosterone production, further confirming the role of Leydig cells in testosterone synthesis. Therefore, the correct answer is that Sertoli cells secrete androgen-binding protein.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Sertoli cells are specialized cells in the testes that play a crucial role in supporting spermatogenesis. They are known to secrete androgen-binding protein (ABP), which binds to testosterone to maintain high concentrations of this hormone in the seminiferous tubules, essential for the development of sperm. Testosterone itself is produced by Leydig cells, not Sertoli cells, and is stimulated by luteinizing hormone (LH). Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) acts on Sertoli cells to promote spermatogenesis, but Sertoli cells do not secrete FSH or LH. Therefore, based on standard medical knowledge and the enhanced information provided, the most likely correct answer is that Sertoli cells secrete androgen-binding protein.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
