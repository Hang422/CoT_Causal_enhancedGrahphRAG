All of the following are true about heparin except-\n\n                    ### Options\n                    opa. Weakest acid found in living things\nopb. Most commercial preparations of heparin now utilize pig intestinal slimes\nopc. Act via Antithrombin activation\nopd. Produce thrombocytopenia\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nHeparin is a widely used anticoagulant in cardiac surgery. It acts primarily through the activation of Antithrombin, which is a well-established mechanism of action. Most commercial preparations of heparin are derived from pig intestinal mucosa, which aligns with standard production practices. A known side effect of heparin is thrombocytopenia, specifically heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). The claim that heparin is the 'weakest acid found in living things' is incorrect and not supported by biochemical consensus. Therefore, the statement about heparin being the weakest acid is the exception among the options provided.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "
