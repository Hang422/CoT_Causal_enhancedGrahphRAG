HDL\nopb. LDL\nopc. VLDL\nopd. Chylomicrons\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nThe primary transporter of cholesterol from the liver to peripheral tissues is Low-Density Lipoprotein (LDL). Cholesterol is synthesized in the liver and initially packaged into Very Low-Density Lipoproteins (VLDL). VLDL delivers triglycerides to tissues and is subsequently converted into LDL in the bloodstream. LDL is then responsible for transporting cholesterol to peripheral tissues. This aligns with the consensus that LDL is the main carrier of cholesterol to peripheral tissues. High-Density Lipoprotein (HDL) is primarily involved in reverse cholesterol transport, moving cholesterol from peripheral tissues back to the liver, not the other way around. Chylomicrons mainly transport dietary lipids from the intestines, not cholesterol from the liver. The evidence paths support the interaction of triglycerides with LDL and the role of VLDL in the conversion process, confirming the consensus that LDL is the main transporter of cholesterol to peripheral tissues.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "
