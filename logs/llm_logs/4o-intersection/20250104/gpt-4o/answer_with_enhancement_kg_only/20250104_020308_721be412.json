Sparfloxacin\nopb. Tetracycline\nopc. Gentamicin\nopd. Clofazimine\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nPseudotumour cerebri, also known as idiopathic intracranial hypertension, is a condition characterized by increased intracranial pressure without an obvious cause. Among the listed drugs, tetracycline is well-documented in medical literature to be associated with causing Pseudotumour cerebri. This aligns with the reasoning chain that links tetracycline to increased intracranial pressure and subsequently to Pseudotumour cerebri. The other options, Sparfloxacin, Gentamicin, and Clofazimine, do not have a known association with Pseudotumour cerebri. Sparfloxacin is an antibiotic with no established link to this condition, Gentamicin is known for ototoxicity but not for causing Pseudotumour cerebri, and Clofazimine is associated with skin discoloration but not with increased intracranial pressure. Therefore, the consensus supports tetracycline as the drug that can cause Pseudotumour cerebri.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Pseudotumour cerebri, or idiopathic intracranial hypertension, is a condition characterized by increased intracranial pressure without a detectable cause. Among the drugs listed, tetracycline is well-documented in medical literature to be associated with causing Pseudotumour cerebri. This association is due to tetracycline's potential to increase intracranial pressure, which can lead to the symptoms of this condition. The other drugs listed, Sparfloxacin, Gentamicin, and Clofazimine, do not have a known association with Pseudotumour cerebri. Sparfloxacin is an antibiotic with no established link to this condition, Gentamicin is primarily known for its ototoxic effects, and Clofazimine is associated with skin discoloration but not with increased intracranial pressure. Therefore, based on standard medical knowledge and consensus, tetracycline is the most likely drug to cause Pseudotumour cerebri.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
