Heparin sulfate\nopb. Protamine sulfate\nopc. Low molecular weight heparin\nopd. Warfarin\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nFor prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism in patients undergoing cancer surgery, the standard consensus is to use Low Molecular Weight Heparin (LMWH) due to its effectiveness and convenience. LMWH is preferred over unfractionated heparin (Heparin sulfate) because it requires less frequent dosing and monitoring. Warfarin is not ideal for immediate prophylaxis due to its need for monitoring and delayed onset of action. Protamine sulfate is not an anticoagulant; it is used to reverse the effects of heparin, making it irrelevant for prophylaxis. The evidence paths confirm the association of anticoagulation with preventing thrombosis, supporting the use of anticoagulants like LMWH in this context.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"In the context of prophylaxis for venous thromboembolism in patients undergoing cancer surgery, the standard medical consensus supports the use of Low Molecular Weight Heparin (LMWH). This is due to its proven effectiveness, ease of administration, and reduced need for monitoring compared to unfractionated heparin (Heparin sulfate). Warfarin is not suitable for immediate prophylaxis because it requires time to achieve therapeutic levels and needs regular monitoring. Protamine sulfate is not an anticoagulant but rather a reversal agent for heparin, making it irrelevant for prophylaxis. Therefore, based on the consensus and enhanced information, LMWH is the most appropriate choice.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opc\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
