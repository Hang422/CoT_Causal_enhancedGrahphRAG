Glucocoicoids\nopb. Mineralcoicoids\nopc. Aldosterone\nopd. Androgens\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nThe zona reticularis of the adrenal cortex primarily secretes androgens, which is supported by the consensus that this layer is responsible for producing these hormones. The retrieved evidence path 'Zona Reticularis-LOCATION_OF->Androgens' directly supports this. While the zona reticularis may produce some glucocorticoids, they are not the major hormones secreted by this layer, aligning with the consensus that glucocorticoids are primarily produced by the zona fasciculata. The evidence path 'Zona Reticularis-LOCATION_OF->Androgens' further confirms the primary role of androgens. Mineralocorticoids and aldosterone are not major products of the zona reticularis, as they are primarily produced by the zona glomerulosa. The evidence paths related to aldosterone and mineralocorticoids do not provide relevant support for their production in the zona reticularis. Therefore, the major hormone secreted by the zona reticularis is androgens.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The adrenal cortex is divided into three zones, each responsible for producing different types of hormones. The zona reticularis is the innermost layer of the adrenal cortex and is primarily responsible for the production of androgens. This is supported by standard medical knowledge and consensus, which indicates that while the zona reticularis may produce some glucocorticoids, they are not the major hormones secreted by this layer. Glucocorticoids are mainly produced by the zona fasciculata, and mineralocorticoids, including aldosterone, are primarily produced by the zona glomerulosa. Therefore, the most likely correct answer, based on the consensus and standard medical knowledge, is that the major hormone secreted by the zona reticularis is androgens.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
