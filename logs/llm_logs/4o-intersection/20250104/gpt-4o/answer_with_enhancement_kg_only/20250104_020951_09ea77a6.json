Family of three seven transmembrane protein\nopb. Activated by thrombin\nopc. Releases PGE2\nopd. Protects epithelial cells\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nProtease activated receptors (PARs) are a family of four seven transmembrane proteins, not three, which contradicts option opa. They are indeed activated by thrombin, supporting option opb, as confirmed by evidence showing interaction with thrombin. While PARs can be involved in pathways that might lead to the release of PGE2, the mechanism is not well-defined, making option opc less certain. PARs play a role in protecting epithelial cells, aligning with option opd, as they are involved in cellular defense mechanisms. Therefore, the statement that PARs are a family of three seven transmembrane proteins is false, making option opa the correct choice for the exception.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "
