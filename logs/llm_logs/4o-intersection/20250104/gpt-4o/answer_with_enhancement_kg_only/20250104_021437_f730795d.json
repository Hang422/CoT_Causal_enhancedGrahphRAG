B1\nopb. B2\nopc. B6\nopd. B12\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nWernicke's encephalopathy is primarily associated with a deficiency in vitamin B1, also known as thiamine. This condition is characterized by neurological symptoms such as confusion, ataxia, and ocular abnormalities. The condition is often linked to chronic alcoholism, which can lead to malnutrition and subsequently thiamine deficiency. The retrieved evidence paths support this by showing the association between Wernicke's encephalopathy and neurological symptoms, as well as its connection to chronic alcoholism and malnutrition. Therefore, the major vitamin deficiency in Wernicke's encephalopathy is vitamin B1.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "
