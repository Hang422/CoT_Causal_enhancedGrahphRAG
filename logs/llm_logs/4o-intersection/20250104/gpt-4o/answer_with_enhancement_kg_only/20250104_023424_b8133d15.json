Striated\nopb. Large T tubules\nopc. Troponin system present\nopd. Caldesmon is impoant regulatory protein\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nCardiac muscle is characterized by a striated appearance, similar to skeletal muscle, due to the arrangement of actin and myosin filaments, which is a consensus fact. It also features large T tubules that facilitate efficient calcium handling, crucial for cardiac muscle contraction. The presence of the troponin system in cardiac muscle is well-established, as it plays a key role in the regulation of contraction by binding calcium ions. However, caldesmon is not an important regulatory protein in cardiac muscle; it is more relevant in smooth muscle regulation. Therefore, the statement that caldesmon is an important regulatory protein in cardiac muscle contradicts standard consensus and is the correct exception.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Cardiac muscle is known for its striated appearance due to the organized arrangement of actin and myosin filaments, similar to skeletal muscle, confirming option 'opa' as a feature. Large T tubules are present in cardiac muscle, facilitating calcium ion transport, which supports option 'opb'. The troponin system is crucial in cardiac muscle for regulating contraction by binding calcium, validating option 'opc'. Caldesmon, however, is primarily associated with smooth muscle regulation and not cardiac muscle, making option 'opd' the correct exception. This aligns with standard medical knowledge and consensus.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
