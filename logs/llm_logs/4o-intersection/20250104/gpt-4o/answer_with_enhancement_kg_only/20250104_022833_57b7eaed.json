Monotherapy for acute episodes\nopb. Monitoring of serum concentration is not useful for guiding dose adjustment\nopc. Can result in leucocytosis\nopd. Can result in hypehyroidism on long term use\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nLithium is commonly used in the management of manic episodes in bipolar disorder, but it is typically not used as monotherapy for acute episodes due to the need for rapid stabilization, often requiring additional medications. Monitoring of serum lithium concentration is crucial for guiding dose adjustment to ensure therapeutic efficacy and avoid toxicity, contradicting the claim that it is not useful. Lithium can indeed cause leucocytosis, as it increases white blood cell count, which is supported by its effects on bone marrow. Long-term use of lithium is associated with thyroid dysfunction, particularly hypothyroidism, rather than hyperthyroidism. The evidence paths related to lithium's effects on white blood cell count support the consensus that lithium can result in leucocytosis.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Lithium is a well-established treatment for bipolar disorder, particularly for maintenance therapy and prevention of manic and depressive episodes. However, it is not typically used as monotherapy for acute manic episodes due to the need for rapid stabilization, which often requires additional medications such as antipsychotics or benzodiazepines. Monitoring of serum lithium concentration is crucial for guiding dose adjustment to ensure therapeutic efficacy and avoid toxicity, making option 'opb' incorrect. Lithium is known to cause leucocytosis, as it can increase white blood cell count, which aligns with option 'opc'. Long-term use of lithium is more commonly associated with hypothyroidism rather than hyperthyroidism, making option 'opd' incorrect. Therefore, the most accurate statement regarding lithium use in manic-depressive psychosis is that it can result in leucocytosis.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opc\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
