Platelet dysfunction\nopb. Aspirin inhibits the action of heparin\nopc. Enhanced hypersensitivity of heparin\nopd. Therapy of heparin cannot be monitored\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nAspirin is not given to a patient who is already on heparin primarily because aspirin causes platelet dysfunction. This is due to aspirin's inhibition of cyclooxygenase, leading to reduced thromboxane A2 production, which is crucial for platelet aggregation. The resulting platelet dysfunction increases the risk of bleeding, which is further exacerbated when combined with heparin, an anticoagulant. The retrieved evidence supports this by linking platelet dysfunction and hemorrhage with heparin use. There is no evidence or consensus to suggest that aspirin inhibits the action of heparin, enhances hypersensitivity to heparin, or affects the monitoring of heparin therapy. Therefore, the primary concern is the increased bleeding risk due to platelet dysfunction caused by aspirin.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Aspirin is known to cause platelet dysfunction by irreversibly inhibiting the enzyme cyclooxygenase, which leads to decreased production of thromboxane A2, a molecule essential for platelet aggregation. This platelet dysfunction increases the risk of bleeding. When a patient is on heparin, an anticoagulant that also increases bleeding risk, the combination with aspirin can significantly heighten the risk of hemorrhage. The other options do not align with the known pharmacological interactions between aspirin and heparin. There is no evidence that aspirin inhibits the action of heparin, enhances hypersensitivity to heparin, or affects the monitoring of heparin therapy. Therefore, the primary concern with using aspirin in a patient on heparin is the increased risk of bleeding due to platelet dysfunction.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
