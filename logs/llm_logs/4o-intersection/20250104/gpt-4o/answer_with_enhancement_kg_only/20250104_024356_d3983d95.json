Chylomicrons\nopb. VLDL\nopc. HDL\nopd. LDL\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nThe transfer of lipids from the intestine to the liver is primarily facilitated by chylomicrons. Dietary fats are absorbed in the intestine and packaged into chylomicrons, which are then transported via the lymphatic system into the bloodstream. Once in the bloodstream, chylomicrons deliver triglycerides and other lipids to the liver. This process is well-supported by physiological consensus and aligns with the reasoning chains provided. The retrieved evidence paths, while broad, confirm the association of chylomicrons with the intestines and their role in lipid transport, supporting the consensus that chylomicrons are the primary carriers of dietary lipids to the liver.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "
