Ca transporter\nopb. Cu transporter\nopc. Zn transporter\nopd. Se transporter\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nMenke's Kinky hair syndrome is primarily due to a defect in copper metabolism, specifically involving a Cu transporter. This aligns with the consensus that the syndrome is caused by mutations in the ATP7A gene, which encodes a copper-transporting ATPase. The retrieved evidence paths support this by linking symptoms such as neurological issues and connective tissue disorders to copper transport problems. Hypocupremia, or low copper levels, is associated with functional disorders involving membrane transport proteins, further confirming the role of copper transport in the disease. Therefore, the correct answer is that Menke's Kinky hair syndrome is due to a defect in the Cu transporter.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Menke's Kinky hair syndrome, also known as Menkes disease, is a genetic disorder that affects copper levels in the body. The condition is caused by mutations in the ATP7A gene, which encodes a copper-transporting ATPase. This defect leads to impaired copper absorption and distribution, resulting in low levels of copper in the body (hypocupremia). The symptoms of Menkes disease, such as neurological issues, connective tissue disorders, and the characteristic 'kinky' hair, are directly linked to this defect in copper transport. Therefore, the most likely correct option is that Menke's Kinky hair syndrome is due to a defect in the Cu transporter.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
