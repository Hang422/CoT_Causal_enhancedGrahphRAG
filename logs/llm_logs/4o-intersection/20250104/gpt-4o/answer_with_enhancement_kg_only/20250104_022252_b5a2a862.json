Duodenum\nopb. Ileum\nopc. Jejunum\nopd. Colon\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nVitamin B12 absorption occurs in the ileum, where it binds to intrinsic factor, a protein necessary for its absorption. The consensus is that Vitamin B12, after binding to intrinsic factor in the stomach, travels through the duodenum and jejunum without being absorbed, and is finally absorbed in the ileum. The evidence paths support this by indicating interactions of intrinsic factor with cells in the ileum, confirming its role in Vitamin B12 absorption. The other options (duodenum, jejunum, colon) are incorrect as they are not the sites of Vitamin B12 absorption. The ileum is the correct answer based on physiological consensus and supported by the evidence paths showing intrinsic factor's interaction with ileal cells.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Vitamin B12 absorption is a well-understood physiological process. After Vitamin B12 is released from food in the stomach, it binds to intrinsic factor, a glycoprotein secreted by the parietal cells of the stomach. This complex then travels through the duodenum and jejunum without being absorbed. The absorption of Vitamin B12 occurs in the ileum, where specific receptors recognize the intrinsic factor-B12 complex, allowing for its uptake into the bloodstream. The enhanced information aligns with the standard medical consensus that the ileum is the site of Vitamin B12 absorption. The other options, including the duodenum, jejunum, and colon, do not play a role in the absorption of Vitamin B12. Therefore, the most likely correct answer is the ileum.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 100\n}\n```",
