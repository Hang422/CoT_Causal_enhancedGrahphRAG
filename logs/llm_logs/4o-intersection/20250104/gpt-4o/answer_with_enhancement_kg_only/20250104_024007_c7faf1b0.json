Methotrexate\nopb. Doxorubicin\nopc. Cisplatin\nopd. Busulfan\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nPulmonary fibrosis is a known complication of certain medications, particularly those with lung toxicity. Methotrexate, an immunosuppressive therapy, is associated with potential lung toxicity and can lead to pulmonary fibrosis, aligning with the consensus that it is a recognized risk. The evidence paths support its interaction with immune cells, which can contribute to lung complications. Doxorubicin, primarily known for cardiotoxicity, has less common associations with lung toxicity and pulmonary fibrosis, making it a less likely cause. Cisplatin is mainly associated with nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity, with pulmonary fibrosis being a rare complication, thus less relevant. Busulfan, an alkylating agent, is well-documented to cause lung toxicity and is strongly associated with pulmonary fibrosis, supported by its classification and known effects. Therefore, Busulfan is the most likely option to cause pulmonary fibrosis, followed by Methotrexate, while Doxorubicin and Cisplatin are less commonly implicated.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "
