Fibrinolysis\nopb. Activation of collagenase\nopc. Destruction of VWF\nopd. Stabilization of fibrin\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nPlasmin is primarily known for its role in fibrinolysis, where it breaks down fibrin clots, which is a well-established function. This aligns with the consensus and is supported by the evidence path showing plasmin causes fibrinolysis. The activation of collagenase by plasmin is less well-documented but possible, suggesting a role in tissue remodeling, though not a primary function. The destruction of von Willebrand factor (VWF) by plasmin is plausible, as plasmin can degrade various proteins, but it is not a primary or well-characterized function. The stabilization of fibrin contradicts the primary role of plasmin in fibrinolysis, as plasmin breaks down fibrin rather than stabilizing it. Therefore, the correct answer is that plasmin does not stabilize fibrin.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

While plasmin may have some role in activating collagenase, this is not its primary function and is less documented. Plasmin can degrade various proteins, including von Willebrand factor (VWF), but this is not a primary or well-characterized function. The stabilization of fibrin is directly contradictory to the primary role of plasmin, as plasmin's main function is to break down fibrin, not stabilize it.
