Vitamin A\nopb. Vitamin C\nopc. Vitamin D\nopd. Vitamin B12\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nVitamin D is widely recognized for its role in improving insulin sensitivity, which can lead to reduced insulin resistance. This reduction in insulin resistance is associated with a decreased risk of obesity and metabolic syndrome. The retrieved evidence path supports this by linking Vitamin D with insulin sensitivity, which is a key factor in managing insulin resistance. In contrast, Vitamin A and Vitamin C, while having antioxidant properties, do not have a clear or direct impact on insulin resistance according to current consensus. Vitamin B12 is primarily involved in energy metabolism and mood disorders, with no strong evidence supporting its role in reducing insulin resistance. Therefore, Vitamin D is the most supported option for reducing the risk of insulin resistance, obesity, and metabolic syndrome.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Vitamin D is known to play a significant role in improving insulin sensitivity, which is crucial in reducing insulin resistance. This improvement can lead to a decreased risk of obesity and metabolic syndrome. The enhanced information supports this by highlighting Vitamin D's link to insulin sensitivity. In contrast, Vitamin A and Vitamin C, while beneficial for their antioxidant properties, do not have a direct impact on insulin resistance. Vitamin B12 is more associated with energy metabolism and neurological functions rather than insulin resistance. Therefore, based on current medical consensus and the enhanced information provided, Vitamin D is the most likely correct option for reducing the risk of insulin resistance, obesity, and metabolic syndrome.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opc\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}\n```",
