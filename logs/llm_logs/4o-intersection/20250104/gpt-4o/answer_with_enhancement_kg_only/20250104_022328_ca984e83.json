Single dose in ascariasis\nopb. Immunostimulant\nopc. Paralysis of worms by depolarisation\nopd. Immunodepressant in high doses\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nLevamisole is used as a single dose treatment for ascariasis, effectively causing paralysis of worms through depolarization of their muscles, which aligns with its known anthelmintic properties. It also acts as an immunostimulant, enhancing the immune response, which is supported by its association with immunologic adjuvants. However, the use of levamisole as an immunodepressant in high doses is not widely accepted or supported by standard medical consensus, making it the least likely use among the options provided.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Levamisole is primarily known for its anthelmintic properties, particularly in treating ascariasis by causing paralysis of worms through depolarization. It is also recognized for its role as an immunostimulant, enhancing the immune response. However, the use of levamisole as an immunodepressant in high doses is not supported by standard medical literature or consensus. The drug is not typically used to suppress the immune system, and there is no substantial evidence to suggest it has such a function. Therefore, the option that does not align with the known uses of levamisole is its use as an immunodepressant in high doses.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
