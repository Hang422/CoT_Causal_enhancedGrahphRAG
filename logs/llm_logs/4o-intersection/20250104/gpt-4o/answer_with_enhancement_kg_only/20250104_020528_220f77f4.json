Tolazoline\nopb. Clonidine\nopc. Bismuth\nopd. Oxymetazoline\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nTolazoline is a vasodilator that increases blood flow and is used in diagnostic tests for pulmonary hypertension, aligning with the evidence path that associates it with vasodilation. Clonidine, an alpha-2 adrenergic agonist, reduces sympathetic outflow and blood pressure, and is used in diagnostic tests for pheochromocytoma, which is consistent with its pharmacological profile. Bismuth is primarily used for gastrointestinal protection and ulcer treatment, not typically in diagnostic tests, which aligns with standard medical consensus. Oxymetazoline is a vasoconstrictor used to reduce nasal congestion and is not typically used in diagnostic tests, consistent with its known uses. The evidence paths support the use of Tolazoline in tests related to blood circulation and pulmonary conditions, confirming its role in diagnostic testing for pulmonary hypertension.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The question asks which drug is used in a specific test. Based on standard medical knowledge, Tolazoline is known to be used in diagnostic tests for pulmonary hypertension due to its vasodilatory effects, which help assess pulmonary vascular reactivity. Clonidine is used in diagnostic tests for pheochromocytoma because it can help differentiate between this condition and other causes of hypertension by reducing sympathetic outflow. Bismuth is not typically used in diagnostic tests but rather for gastrointestinal issues. Oxymetazoline is a nasal decongestant and not used in diagnostic tests. Given the context and the enhanced information, Tolazoline is the most likely correct answer as it aligns with its known use in diagnostic testing for pulmonary conditions.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}\n```",
