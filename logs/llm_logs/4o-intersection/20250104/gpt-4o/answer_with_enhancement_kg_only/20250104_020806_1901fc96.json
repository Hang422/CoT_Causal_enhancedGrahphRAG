Increased blood pressure caused by nicotine\nopb. Increased skeletal muscle strength caused by neostigmine, an acetycholine esterase inhibitor\nopc. Bradycardia caused by infusion of acetylcholine\nopd. All of these\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nAtropine is a muscarinic receptor blocker, which means it can prevent the effects of acetylcholine on muscarinic receptors, such as those in the heart. This aligns with the consensus that atropine can prevent bradycardia caused by acetylcholine infusion, as muscarinic receptors mediate this effect. Atropine does not affect nicotinic receptors, which are responsible for the effects of nicotine on blood pressure and neostigmine on skeletal muscle strength. Therefore, atropine cannot block the increased blood pressure caused by nicotine or the increased skeletal muscle strength caused by neostigmine. The retrieved evidence paths confirm atropine's association with muscarinic receptors but do not provide relevant information on nicotinic receptor-mediated effects. Thus, the correct option is that atropine can block bradycardia caused by acetylcholine infusion, but not the other effects.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Atropine is a muscarinic receptor antagonist, meaning it blocks the action of acetylcholine at muscarinic receptors. Muscarinic receptors are primarily found in the heart, smooth muscles, and glands. Atropine is known to counteract bradycardia (slow heart rate) caused by acetylcholine because this effect is mediated through muscarinic receptors in the heart. Nicotine primarily acts on nicotinic receptors, which are not affected by atropine, so atropine cannot block the increased blood pressure caused by nicotine. Similarly, neostigmine increases skeletal muscle strength by inhibiting acetylcholinesterase, leading to increased acetylcholine at nicotinic receptors in the neuromuscular junction, which atropine does not block. Therefore, the most likely correct option is that atropine can block bradycardia caused by acetylcholine infusion, but not the other effects.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opc\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
