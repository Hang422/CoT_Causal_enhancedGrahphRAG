Lipase\nopb. Pepsinogens\nopc. HCI\nopd. None\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nThe stomach secretes pepsinogens and hydrochloric acid (HCl), which are essential for protein digestion and creating an acidic environment, respectively. While the stomach does secrete gastric lipase, the primary source of lipase is the pancreas, which is responsible for the majority of lipid digestion. Therefore, lipase is not primarily secreted by the stomach. The evidence path indicating lipase as part of the pancreas supports this consensus. Thus, the correct answer is that lipase is not secreted by the stomach as its main function.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The stomach is known to secrete pepsinogens and hydrochloric acid (HCl), which are crucial for the digestion of proteins and maintaining an acidic environment. While the stomach does produce gastric lipase, it is not the primary source of lipase in the body. The pancreas is the main organ responsible for lipase secretion, which plays a significant role in lipid digestion. Therefore, although the stomach secretes a small amount of lipase, it is not considered a primary secretion of the stomach. Based on this understanding, the most likely correct answer is that lipase is not primarily secreted by the stomach.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}\n```",
