Aldosterone\nopb. DOCA\nopc. Fludrocoeisone\nopd. Triamcinolone\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nAldosterone is the most potent mineralocorticoid, characterized by its strong sodium retention and significant impact on increasing blood volume, which aligns with its role in causing hypernatremia. Fludrocortisone also exhibits strong sodium retention and mineralocorticoid effects but is less potent than aldosterone. DOCA (Desoxycorticosterone acetate) has moderate sodium retention and is less potent than aldosterone, as supported by its association with hypernatremia. Triamcinolone has minimal mineralocorticoid activity and weak sodium retention, making it the least potent in this context. Therefore, based on consensus and evidence, aldosterone is the most potent mineralocorticoid.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Mineralocorticoids are a class of corticosteroids that influence salt and water balances. Aldosterone is the primary and most potent mineralocorticoid produced by the adrenal cortex. It plays a crucial role in regulating sodium and potassium levels in the body, which directly affects blood pressure and fluid balance. Fludrocortisone is a synthetic corticosteroid with potent mineralocorticoid properties, but it is primarily used for its glucocorticoid effects and is less potent than aldosterone in terms of mineralocorticoid activity. DOCA (Desoxycorticosterone acetate) is another synthetic mineralocorticoid, but it is less potent than aldosterone. Triamcinolone is primarily a glucocorticoid with minimal mineralocorticoid activity. Based on standard medical knowledge and consensus, aldosterone is recognized as the most potent natural mineralocorticoid.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
