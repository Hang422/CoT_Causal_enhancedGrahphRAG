Can be used in absence seizures\nopb. Can be mixed with saline\nopc. Can be given orally\nopd. It is the drug of choice for myoclonic seizures\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nFosphenytoin is a water-soluble prodrug of phenytoin, which allows it to be mixed with saline for intravenous or intramuscular administration, unlike phenytoin which is not water-soluble and cannot be mixed with saline. This aligns with the consensus that fosphenytoin is not effective for absence seizures, similar to phenytoin, and is not the drug of choice for myoclonic seizures. Fosphenytoin cannot be given orally, as it is designed for parenteral administration. The retrieved evidence paths confirm that fosphenytoin is used to treat seizures but do not specifically address its use in absence or myoclonic seizures, nor its administration route, thus supporting the consensus that fosphenytoin's main distinction from phenytoin is its solubility and administration method.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

This is a key difference from phenytoin, which is not water-soluble and cannot be mixed with saline. Both fosphenytoin and phenytoin are not effective for absence seizures and are not the drugs of choice for myoclonic seizures. Additionally, fosphenytoin is not administered orally, as it is specifically designed for parenteral use. Therefore, the most significant distinction between fosphenytoin and phenytoin is its ability to be mixed with saline for administration.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
