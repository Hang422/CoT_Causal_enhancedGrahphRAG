Child's presentation is most likely due to the deficiency of which enzyme?\n\n                    ### Options\n                    opa. HGPase\nopb. Adenosine Deaminase\nopc. APase\nopd. Acid Maltase\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nThe child's symptoms, including aggressive behavior, self-mutilation, neurological symptoms, joint pain, and reduced urinary output, are characteristic of Lesch-Nyhan syndrome. This syndrome is caused by a deficiency in the enzyme hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRT). The reasoning chains correctly identify HGPRT deficiency as the cause, aligning with the consensus that Lesch-Nyhan syndrome results from a disorder of purine metabolism leading to hyperuricemia and associated symptoms. The retrieved evidence paths support this by linking purine metabolism disorders and hyperuricemia to the symptoms observed in Lesch-Nyhan syndrome. Therefore, the enzyme deficiency responsible for the child's presentation is HGPRT.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "
