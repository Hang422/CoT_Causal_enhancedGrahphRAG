Arachidonic acid\nopb. Cholesterol\nopc. Palmitic acid\nopd. Stearic acid\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nThe fluidity of the plasma membrane is influenced by the types of fatty acids present. Arachidonic acid, an unsaturated fatty acid, increases membrane fluidity due to its kinks that prevent tight packing of lipid molecules. This aligns with the consensus that unsaturated fatty acids enhance membrane fluidity. Cholesterol, while often associated with increased membrane rigidity, can also increase fluidity at low temperatures by preventing fatty acid chains from packing too closely, but generally decreases fluidity at physiological temperatures. Palmitic acid and stearic acid are saturated fatty acids, which decrease membrane fluidity by allowing tighter packing of lipid molecules. The retrieved evidence paths confirm the presence of palmitic acid as a saturated fat, supporting its role in decreasing membrane fluidity. Therefore, arachidonic acid is the most likely to increase membrane fluidity.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The fluidity of the plasma membrane is primarily influenced by the types of fatty acids present. Unsaturated fatty acids, such as arachidonic acid, increase membrane fluidity due to their double bonds, which introduce kinks in the fatty acid chains and prevent tight packing of the lipid molecules. This is a well-established principle in physiology. Cholesterol has a complex role; it can increase fluidity at low temperatures but generally decreases fluidity at physiological temperatures. Saturated fatty acids like palmitic acid and stearic acid decrease fluidity because they allow for tighter packing of the lipid molecules. Given this information, arachidonic acid is the most likely to increase membrane fluidity.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
