They are called as \"high ceiling\" diuretics\nopb. They act on Na+.K+.2Cl- symporter\nopc. They can cause hyperuricemia\nopd. Loop diuretics lead to hypercalcemia and hypomagnesimia\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nLoop diuretics are known as 'high ceiling' diuretics due to their potent diuretic effect, which aligns with the consensus that they significantly increase diuresis. They act on the Na+-K+-2Cl- symporter in the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle, inhibiting the reabsorption of sodium, potassium, and chloride, which is a well-established mechanism of action. Loop diuretics can cause hyperuricemia due to increased reabsorption of uric acid, which is a recognized side effect. However, they lead to increased excretion of calcium and magnesium, resulting in hypocalcemia and hypomagnesemia, not hypercalcemia. The retrieved evidence supports the association of loop diuretics with increased excretory function, which aligns with their effect on calcium and magnesium excretion. Therefore, the statement that loop diuretics lead to hypercalcemia is incorrect, as they actually cause hypocalcemia.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Loop diuretics are known as 'high ceiling' diuretics due to their potent effect on increasing urine output, which is consistent with option opa. They act on the Na+-K+-2Cl- symporter in the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle, which is accurately described in option opb. Loop diuretics can cause hyperuricemia, as mentioned in option opc, due to increased reabsorption of uric acid. However, they lead to increased excretion of calcium and magnesium, resulting in hypocalcemia and hypomagnesemia, not hypercalcemia. Therefore, option opd is incorrect because it states that loop diuretics lead to hypercalcemia, which contradicts the known effect of these drugs. The consensus in medical literature supports that loop diuretics cause hypocalcemia, not hypercalcemia.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
