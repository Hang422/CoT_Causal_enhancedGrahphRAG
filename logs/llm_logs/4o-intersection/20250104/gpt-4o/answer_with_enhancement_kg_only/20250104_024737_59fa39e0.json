Thiothixanthene\nopb. Phenothiazine\nopc. Butyrophenone\nopd. Diphenyl butyl piperidine\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nPimozide is an antipsychotic medication primarily used for the treatment of Tourette's syndrome. It is structurally and pharmacologically classified as a diphenyl butyl piperidine. The reasoning chain that aligns with consensus is that Pimozide is not a thiothixanthene, phenothiazine, or butyrophenone, but rather belongs to the diphenyl butyl piperidine class. The retrieved evidence paths confirm Pimozide's role as an antipsychotic agent, which supports its classification. Therefore, the correct class for Pimozide is diphenyl butyl piperidine.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

It is structurally classified as a diphenyl butyl piperidine. This classification is based on its chemical structure and pharmacological properties. The other options, such as thiothixanthene, phenothiazine, and butyrophenone, represent different classes of antipsychotic drugs with distinct chemical structures and mechanisms of action. The consensus in pharmacology literature supports that Pimozide belongs to the diphenyl butyl piperidine class, as it does not share the structural characteristics of the other classes listed.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
