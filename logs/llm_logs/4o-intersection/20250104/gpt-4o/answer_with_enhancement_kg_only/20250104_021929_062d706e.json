Hyoscine\nopb. Metoclopramide\nopc. Prochlorperazine\nopd. Ondansetron\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nHyoscine, also known as scopolamine, is an anticholinergic drug that effectively prevents motion sickness by inhibiting the vestibular system, which aligns with standard medical consensus. Metoclopramide and Prochlorperazine are dopamine antagonists that act on the chemoreceptor trigger zone to reduce nausea but are not specific for motion sickness prophylaxis. Ondansetron is a serotonin antagonist that also acts on the chemoreceptor trigger zone to reduce nausea, but it is not typically used for motion sickness. The retrieved evidence paths confirm the roles of Metoclopramide and Ondansetron as dopamine and serotonin antagonists, respectively, but do not provide specific support for their use in motion sickness prophylaxis. Therefore, Hyoscine is the most appropriate choice for the prophylaxis of motion sickness.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "
