Thalamus\nopb. Corpus striatum\nopc. Tegmentum of pons\nopd. Tectum of midbrain\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nThe substantia nigra is a critical structure in the brain involved in the production of dopamine, a neurotransmitter essential for motor control. The primary efferent fibers of the substantia nigra project to the corpus striatum, which is part of the basal ganglia. This pathway, known as the nigrostriatal pathway, is well-established and plays a significant role in the regulation of movement. While dopamine can interact with various brain regions, the direct and primary transmission from the substantia nigra is to the corpus striatum. Other potential pathways, such as to the thalamus, tegmentum of pons, or tectum of midbrain, are either less direct or not primarily associated with the substantia nigra's efferent fibers. Therefore, the most consensus-aligned answer is that the efferent fibers of the substantia nigra transmit dopamine to the corpus striatum.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "
