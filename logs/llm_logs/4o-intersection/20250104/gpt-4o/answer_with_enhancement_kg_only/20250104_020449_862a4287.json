Anti depressants\nopb. Anti psychotics\nopc. Anti epileptics\nopd. Mood stabilizers\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nSchizophrenia is primarily treated with antipsychotics, which work by blocking dopamine receptors to manage symptoms such as hallucinations and delusions. This aligns with the consensus that dopamine dysregulation is a key factor in schizophrenia. Antipsychotics are effective in reducing positive symptoms and may also help with negative and cognitive symptoms, although to a lesser extent. Evidence paths confirm the association between schizophrenia and antipsychotic agents, supporting their role in treatment. Antidepressants may be used for comorbid depression in schizophrenia but are not the primary treatment. Antiepileptics and mood stabilizers are not standard treatments for schizophrenia, though they may be used in specific cases for mood stabilization. The evidence paths related to antiepileptics and mood stabilizers do not provide strong support for their use as primary treatments in schizophrenia.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "
