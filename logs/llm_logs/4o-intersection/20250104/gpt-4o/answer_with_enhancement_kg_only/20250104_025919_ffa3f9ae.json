Selenium\nopb. Phosphorus\nopc. Boron\nopd. Zinc\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nSelenium deficiency is well-documented to cause oxidative stress, which can lead to cardiomyopathy. This aligns with the consensus that selenium is crucial for antioxidant defense, and its deficiency can directly impact heart muscle function. Phosphorus deficiency is primarily associated with muscle weakness but lacks a direct link to cardiomyopathy. Boron deficiency has unclear physiological impacts and no established connection to cardiomyopathy. Zinc deficiency can lead to immune dysfunction, which might indirectly affect cardiac health, but it is not a primary cause of cardiomyopathy. The retrieved evidence path involving paresis and viruses does not directly relate to nutrient deficiencies causing cardiomyopathy and is therefore not relevant to this question. Based on consensus, selenium deficiency is the most directly linked to cardiomyopathy.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Cardiomyopathy is a disease of the heart muscle that can be caused by various factors, including nutritional deficiencies. Among the options provided, selenium deficiency is the most well-documented cause of cardiomyopathy. Selenium is a crucial component of antioxidant enzymes like glutathione peroxidase, which protect cells from oxidative damage. A deficiency in selenium can lead to increased oxidative stress, particularly affecting the heart muscle, and is known to cause a specific type of cardiomyopathy called Keshan disease. Phosphorus, boron, and zinc deficiencies do not have a direct and well-established link to cardiomyopathy. Therefore, based on standard medical knowledge and consensus, selenium deficiency is the most likely cause of cardiomyopathy among the given options.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
