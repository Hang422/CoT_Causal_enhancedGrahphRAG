Nimodipine\nopb. Amlodipine\nopc. Diltiazem\nopd. Verapamil\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nNimodipine is the drug indicated for subarachnoid hemorrhage due to its specific action as a calcium channel blocker that causes vasodilation, which is particularly effective in reducing cerebral vasospasm. This is supported by evidence showing that nimodipine interacts with calcium channel blockers and causes vasodilation, which is associated with the prevention and treatment of cerebral vasospasm. In contrast, amlodipine, diltiazem, and verapamil, while also calcium channel blockers, primarily cause systemic vasodilation and lower blood pressure, but are not specifically effective for cerebral vasospasm, making them less suitable for subarachnoid hemorrhage treatment.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"In the context of subarachnoid hemorrhage, the primary concern is the prevention and treatment of cerebral vasospasm, which can lead to delayed cerebral ischemia. Nimodipine is a calcium channel blocker that is specifically indicated for this condition due to its ability to preferentially dilate cerebral blood vessels and reduce the risk of vasospasm. While other calcium channel blockers like amlodipine, diltiazem, and verapamil also cause vasodilation, they are not specifically effective in targeting cerebral vasospasm. Therefore, based on standard medical knowledge and consensus, nimodipine is the most appropriate choice for managing subarachnoid hemorrhage.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
