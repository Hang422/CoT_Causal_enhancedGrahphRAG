Chlorpropamide\nopb. Glibenclamide\nopc. Glicazide\nopd. Glipizide\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nChlorpropamide is a drug from the sulfonylurea class that stimulates insulin release, making it effective in treating type 2 diabetes mellitus. Additionally, it has an antidiuretic effect, which allows it to be used in the treatment of diabetes insipidus, making it unique among the options provided. Glibenclamide, Glicazide, and Glipizide are also sulfonylureas that stimulate insulin release and are used to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus, but they do not have an effect on diabetes insipidus. The retrieved evidence path about insulin's role in non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus supports the use of sulfonylureas in treating type 2 diabetes but does not provide additional insight into their effects on diabetes insipidus. Therefore, Chlorpropamide is the only drug among the options that is used to treat both diabetes mellitus and diabetes insipidus.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Chlorpropamide is a sulfonylurea that is primarily used to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus by stimulating insulin release. It is unique among the options provided because it also has an antidiuretic effect, which allows it to be used in the treatment of diabetes insipidus. This dual action is not shared by the other sulfonylureas listed (Glibenclamide, Glicazide, and Glipizide), which are only used for type 2 diabetes mellitus. The enhanced information aligns with standard medical knowledge, confirming that Chlorpropamide is the only drug among the options that can treat both conditions. Therefore, the most likely correct answer is Chlorpropamide.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
