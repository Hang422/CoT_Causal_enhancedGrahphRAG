Patient gives history of recurrent bacterial infections. Ophthalmic examination reveals white triangular plaques on conjunctiva. This patient is suffering from deficiency of:\n\n                    ### Options\n                    opa. Vitamin D\nopb. Vitamin B\nopc. Vitamin A\nopd. Vitamin C\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nThe symptoms presented by the patient, including night vision problems, dryness of eyes, recurrent bacterial infections, and the presence of white triangular plaques on the conjunctiva (Bitot's spots), are indicative of Vitamin A deficiency. Vitamin A is crucial for the production of rhodopsin, a pigment necessary for low-light vision, explaining the night blindness. It also plays a role in maintaining healthy epithelial tissues, which includes the conjunctiva, and its deficiency can lead to dryness of eyes and the formation of Bitot's spots. Additionally, Vitamin A is important for immune function, and its deficiency can impair immune responses, leading to increased susceptibility to infections. The retrieved evidence paths support these points by linking Vitamin A deficiency to eye health, immune function, and rhodopsin production. Therefore, the patient is most likely suffering from a deficiency of Vitamin A.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "
