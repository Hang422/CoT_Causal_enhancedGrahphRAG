Allopurinol\nopb. Probenecid\nopc. Indomethacin\nopd. Aspirin\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nProbenecid is a uricosuric drug because it increases the renal excretion of uric acid, thereby reducing serum uric acid levels. This aligns with the consensus that uricosuric drugs promote the excretion of uric acid. Allopurinol, while used in the management of gout, primarily works by inhibiting xanthine oxidase to decrease uric acid production, not by increasing its excretion, and thus is not considered uricosuric. Indomethacin is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) and does not have uricosuric properties. Aspirin has a complex effect on uric acid excretion: low doses can decrease excretion, while high doses may increase it, but this effect is inconsistent and not primarily uricosuric. Therefore, Probenecid is the correct answer as the uricosuric drug.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The question asks for an uricosuric drug, which is a type of medication that increases the excretion of uric acid in the urine, thereby lowering serum uric acid levels. Among the options provided: Allopurinol is not uricosuric; it reduces uric acid production by inhibiting xanthine oxidase. Indomethacin is an NSAID and does not have uricosuric properties. Aspirin has a dose-dependent effect on uric acid excretion, but it is not primarily used as a uricosuric agent. Probenecid, on the other hand, is a classic uricosuric drug that promotes the renal excretion of uric acid. Therefore, based on standard medical knowledge and consensus, Probenecid is the correct answer.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
