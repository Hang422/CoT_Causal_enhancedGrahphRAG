Morphine\nopb. Dextromethorphan\nopc. Diphenhydramine\nopd. Aprepitant\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nDextromethorphan is known to cause hallucinations due to its action as an NMDA receptor antagonist, which alters neurotransmission. This is supported by evidence linking dextromethorphan to NMDA receptor activity. Morphine, while primarily an opioid receptor agonist, can also cause central nervous system effects, including possible hallucinations, but this is less common. Diphenhydramine, an antihistamine with anticholinergic properties, can lead to central nervous system effects such as hallucinations, though this is not its primary action. Aprepitant, a neurokinin-1 receptor antagonist used mainly for its antiemetic effects, is unlikely to cause hallucinations. Therefore, dextromethorphan is the most likely antitussive to lead to hallucinations.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Dextromethorphan is an antitussive that acts as an NMDA receptor antagonist, which can alter neurotransmission and lead to hallucinations. This is a well-documented effect, especially at higher doses or in cases of misuse. While morphine, diphenhydramine, and aprepitant can have central nervous system effects, hallucinations are not their primary or most common side effects. Morphine is primarily an opioid receptor agonist, and while it can cause hallucinations, this is less common compared to its other effects like sedation and euphoria. Diphenhydramine, an antihistamine, can cause hallucinations due to its anticholinergic properties, but this is not its primary action. Aprepitant is primarily used as an antiemetic and is unlikely to cause hallucinations. Therefore, based on the mechanism of action and documented effects, dextromethorphan is the most likely antitussive to lead to hallucinations.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}",
