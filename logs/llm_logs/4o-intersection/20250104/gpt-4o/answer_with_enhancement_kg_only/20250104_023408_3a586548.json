Mouth\nopb. Stomach\nopc. Small intestine\nopd. Large intestine\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nThe digestion of disaccharides primarily occurs in the small intestine. Disaccharides such as sucrose and lactose are broken down by specific enzymes like sucrase and lactase into monosaccharides, which are then absorbed. In the mouth and stomach, there is no significant digestion of disaccharides due to the lack of specific enzymes. The large intestine is not a primary site for disaccharide digestion, although some bacterial fermentation can occur there. The evidence paths indicating interactions with lipopolysaccharides and lipids in the intestines and stomach are too broad and do not directly address disaccharide digestion. The consensus supports the small intestine as the main site for disaccharide digestion.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The digestion of disaccharides primarily occurs in the small intestine. This is because the small intestine contains specific enzymes such as sucrase, lactase, and maltase that are responsible for breaking down disaccharides into monosaccharides, which can then be absorbed into the bloodstream. In the mouth, the digestion of carbohydrates begins with salivary amylase, but this enzyme does not act on disaccharides. The stomach does not have the necessary enzymes to digest disaccharides, and the large intestine is mainly involved in the absorption of water and electrolytes, with some bacterial fermentation of undigested carbohydrates. Therefore, the small intestine is the primary site for disaccharide digestion, aligning with standard medical knowledge and consensus.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opc\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
