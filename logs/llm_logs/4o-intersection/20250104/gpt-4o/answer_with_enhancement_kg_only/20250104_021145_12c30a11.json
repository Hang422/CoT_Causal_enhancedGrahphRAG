Krabbe's disease\nopb. Fabry's disease\nopc. Fragile syndrome\nopd. All\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nGlycogen storage diseases are a group of metabolic disorders that specifically involve the metabolism of glycogen. Krabbe's disease, Fabry's disease, and Fragile X syndrome are not related to glycogen metabolism. Krabbe's disease is a lysosomal storage disorder affecting the nervous system, Fabry's disease is a lysosomal storage disorder affecting lipid metabolism, and Fragile X syndrome is a genetic disorder affecting intellectual development. The retrieved evidence paths, while correct in their associations, do not directly relate these diseases to glycogen metabolism. Therefore, none of the options (Krabbe's disease, Fabry's disease, Fragile X syndrome) are glycogen storage diseases, making 'All' the correct choice for the exception.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Glycogen storage diseases are a group of inherited metabolic disorders that affect the storage and metabolism of glycogen in the body. The diseases listed in the options—Krabbe's disease, Fabry's disease, and Fragile X syndrome—are not related to glycogen metabolism. Krabbe's disease is a lysosomal storage disorder affecting the nervous system, Fabry's disease is a lysosomal storage disorder affecting lipid metabolism, and Fragile X syndrome is a genetic disorder affecting intellectual development. None of these conditions involve glycogen storage or metabolism.
