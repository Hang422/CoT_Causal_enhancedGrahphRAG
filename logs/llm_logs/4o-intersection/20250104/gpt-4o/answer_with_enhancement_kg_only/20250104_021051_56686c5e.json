It is an enzyme inducer\nopb. It causes obesity\nopc. It causes Hirsutism\nopd. It causes neural tube defects\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nValproic acid is known to be an enzyme inhibitor, not an enzyme inducer, which aligns with the evidence path indicating it is an enzyme inhibitor. It is associated with weight gain, which can lead to obesity, supporting the reasoning chain for this option. While valproic acid can cause hormonal changes, hirsutism is not a well-documented side effect, making this chain less supported by consensus. Valproic acid is teratogenic and can cause neural tube defects, which is a well-established fact. Therefore, the correct answer is that valproic acid does not cause hirsutism, as this is not a recognized effect of the drug.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Valproic acid is primarily known as an enzyme inhibitor, not an inducer, which rules out option opa. It is associated with weight gain, which can lead to obesity, supporting option opb. Valproic acid is a known teratogen and can cause neural tube defects, confirming option opd. While valproic acid can cause hormonal changes, hirsutism is not a well-documented or common side effect, making option opc the least supported by medical consensus. Therefore, the most likely correct answer is that valproic acid does not cause hirsutism.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opc\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
