Retro bulbar neuritis\nopb. Deafness\nopc. Red urine\nopd. Peripheral neuritis\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nEthambutol is known to cause optic nerve toxicity, which can lead to retro bulbar neuritis. This is a well-documented side effect and aligns with medical consensus. There is no strong evidence or consensus supporting ethambutol causing deafness, red urine, or peripheral neuritis. The retrieved evidence paths are not directly relevant to the specific side effects of ethambutol, as they focus on its use in treating conditions like tuberculosis and ischemic stroke, rather than its side effects. Therefore, the most accurate and consensus-supported effect of ethambutol is retro bulbar neuritis.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Ethambutol is an antitubercular medication that is well-documented to cause optic nerve toxicity, specifically retro bulbar neuritis. This side effect is characterized by visual disturbances, such as decreased visual acuity and color vision changes. The other options, including deafness, red urine, and peripheral neuritis, are not commonly associated with ethambutol. Deafness is more commonly linked to other antitubercular drugs like streptomycin. Red urine is typically associated with rifampicin, another antitubercular drug. Peripheral neuritis is more commonly linked to isoniazid, which is also used in tuberculosis treatment. Therefore, based on standard medical knowledge and consensus, the most likely correct answer is that ethambutol causes retro bulbar neuritis.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
