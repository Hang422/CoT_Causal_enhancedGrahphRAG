It has good blood-brain barrier penetrability\nopb. It causes pronounced tachycardia\nopc. It does not activate adrenergic b receptors\nopd. It does not activate peripheral dopaminergic receptors\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nDobutamine is primarily a selective beta-1 adrenergic agonist, which increases heart contractility with minimal activation of peripheral dopaminergic receptors, unlike dopamine, which activates both beta-1 adrenergic and peripheral dopaminergic receptors, leading to increased renal blood flow. Dobutamine has poor blood-brain barrier penetrability, resulting in limited central nervous system effects. It does not cause pronounced tachycardia as it primarily increases contractility rather than heart rate. Therefore, the key difference is that dobutamine does not activate peripheral dopaminergic receptors, unlike dopamine.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Dobutamine is primarily a selective beta-1 adrenergic agonist, which means it primarily affects the heart by increasing contractility with minimal effects on heart rate, thus not causing pronounced tachycardia. It does not penetrate the blood-brain barrier well, so it has limited central nervous system effects. Importantly, dobutamine does not activate peripheral dopaminergic receptors, which is a key difference from dopamine. Dopamine, on the other hand, activates both beta-1 adrenergic and peripheral dopaminergic receptors, affecting both cardiac function and renal blood flow. Therefore, the most significant difference between dobutamine and dopamine is that dobutamine does not activate peripheral dopaminergic receptors.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
