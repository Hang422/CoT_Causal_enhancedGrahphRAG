Meningitis\nopb. Pericarditis\nopc. Ileo-caecal tuberculosis\nopd. Adrenal involvement\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nSteroids are indicated in tuberculous meningitis and pericarditis due to their ability to reduce inflammation, which is a key component of these conditions. This aligns with the consensus that steroids are used to manage inflammation in these cases. The evidence path supports this by showing steroids treat inflammation, which is associated with conditions like pericarditis. In ileo-caecal tuberculosis, steroids are not typically used as the condition is a localized intestinal infection where anti-tubercular therapy is the primary treatment. The reasoning chain correctly identifies that steroids are not indicated here. For adrenal tuberculosis, while steroids mimic adrenal hormones, they are not primarily used for inflammation in this context, and the evidence path confirms that adrenal hormone preparations are more relevant. Therefore, steroids are not indicated for adrenal involvement in tuberculosis.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Steroids are commonly used in tuberculosis cases where inflammation is a significant concern, such as in meningitis and pericarditis, to reduce the inflammatory response and prevent complications. In ileo-caecal tuberculosis, the primary treatment is anti-tubercular therapy, and steroids are not typically indicated as the condition is localized and does not primarily involve inflammation that would benefit from steroid treatment. In cases of adrenal involvement, the issue is more about the destruction of adrenal tissue leading to adrenal insufficiency, where hormone replacement therapy is more relevant than anti-inflammatory treatment with steroids. Therefore, the most likely correct option where steroids are not indicated is ileo-caecal tuberculosis.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opc\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
