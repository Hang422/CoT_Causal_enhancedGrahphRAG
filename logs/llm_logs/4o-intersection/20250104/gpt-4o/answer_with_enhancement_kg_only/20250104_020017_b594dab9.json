Ethanolamine oleate\nopb. Octreotide\nopc. Propanolol\nopd. Phytonadione\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nThe drug of choice for bleeding oesophageal varices is Octreotide. Octreotide works by causing vasoconstriction of the splanchnic circulation, which reduces portal pressure and helps control bleeding from oesophageal varices. This aligns with the consensus that Octreotide is effective in acute management of variceal bleeding. Propranolol, while useful in preventing variceal bleeding by reducing portal hypertension, is not the first choice for acute bleeding. Ethanolamine oleate is used in sclerotherapy to obliterate varices, but it is not the primary pharmacological treatment. Phytonadione (Vitamin K) improves coagulation but is not directly effective in controlling variceal bleeding. The evidence paths support Octreotide's role in treating complications related to blood circulation, confirming its relevance in managing bleeding oesophageal varices.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"In the management of bleeding oesophageal varices, the primary goal is to control the bleeding and stabilize the patient. Octreotide, a somatostatin analogue, is widely recognized as the drug of choice for acute variceal bleeding due to its ability to cause vasoconstriction in the splanchnic circulation, thereby reducing portal pressure and controlling bleeding. This aligns with the consensus in medical practice. Propranolol is used for prophylaxis to prevent variceal bleeding by reducing portal hypertension but is not suitable for acute bleeding. Ethanolamine oleate is used in sclerotherapy, which is a procedural intervention rather than a pharmacological treatment for acute bleeding. Phytonadione (Vitamin K) is used to correct coagulopathy but does not directly address the bleeding from varices. Therefore, based on the consensus and the mechanism of action, Octreotide is the most appropriate choice for acute management of bleeding oesophageal varices.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
