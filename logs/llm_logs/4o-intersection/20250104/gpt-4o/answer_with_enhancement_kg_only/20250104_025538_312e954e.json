Penicillin\nopb. Cotrimoxazole\nopc. Kanamycin\nopd. Levofloxacin\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nPneumocystis pneumonia (PCP), caused by Pneumocystis jirovecii (formerly known as P. carinii), is an opportunistic infection commonly seen in immunocompromised individuals, such as those with HIV/AIDS. The standard treatment and prophylaxis for PCP is Cotrimoxazole (Trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole), which is effective against this organism. Penicillin is ineffective as PCP is not a bacterial infection. Kanamycin and Levofloxacin are not effective or recommended for PCP, as they do not target Pneumocystis jirovecii. The retrieved evidence paths, while broad, do not contradict this consensus and confirm the interaction of Cotrimoxazole with other pharmaceutical preparations, supporting its role as the drug of choice for PCP.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) is caused by the organism Pneumocystis jirovecii, which is not a bacterium, but a fungus-like organism. The standard treatment for PCP is Cotrimoxazole (Trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole), which is effective against this organism. Penicillin is ineffective because PCP is not a bacterial infection. Kanamycin and Levofloxacin are antibiotics that do not target Pneumocystis jirovecii and are not recommended for PCP. The enhanced information supports the consensus that Cotrimoxazole is the drug of choice for treating PCP. Therefore, based on standard medical knowledge and the enhanced information provided, Cotrimoxazole is the most appropriate treatment for pneumonia caused by P. carinii (Pneumocystis jirovecii).\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 100\n}\n```",
