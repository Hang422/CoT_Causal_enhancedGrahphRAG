Aromatase\nopb. 5 alpha reductase\nopc. Desmolase\nopd. Isomerase\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nAromatase is the enzyme responsible for the conversion of androgens to estrogens in the ovarian follicle, which is a critical step in estrogen synthesis. This aligns with the consensus that aromatase facilitates the aromatization of androgens into estrogens, specifically in the granulosa cells of the ovarian follicle. The retrieved evidence path supports this by indicating that aromatase interacts with cells involved in androgen conversion. In contrast, 5 alpha reductase is involved in converting testosterone to dihydrotestosterone, not estrogens. Desmolase is involved in the initial steps of steroidogenesis, converting cholesterol to pregnenolone, and is not specific to estrogen synthesis. Isomerase is involved in the conversion of steroid intermediates but does not specifically catalyze the conversion of androgens to estrogens. Therefore, aromatase is the correct enzyme associated with this conversion in the ovarian follicle.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The conversion of androgens to estrogens in the ovarian follicle is a well-established process in physiology, primarily facilitated by the enzyme aromatase. Aromatase is responsible for the aromatization of androgens into estrogens, specifically within the granulosa cells of the ovarian follicle. This is a critical step in estrogen synthesis. The other enzymes listed, such as 5 alpha reductase, desmolase, and isomerase, have different roles in steroid metabolism and do not specifically catalyze the conversion of androgens to estrogens. Therefore, based on standard medical knowledge and the enhanced information provided, aromatase is the enzyme associated with this conversion.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 100\n}",
