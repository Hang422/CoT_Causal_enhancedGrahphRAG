Anti depressants\nopb. Anti psychotics\nopc. Anti epileptics\nopd. Mood stabilizers\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nSchizophrenia is primarily treated with antipsychotics, which target dopamine dysregulation and are effective in reducing positive symptoms such as hallucinations and delusions. Antipsychotics may also help with negative and cognitive symptoms, though their efficacy in these areas is less pronounced. Antidepressants are not the primary treatment for schizophrenia but may be used adjunctively to address comorbid depression. Antiepileptics and mood stabilizers are not standard treatments for schizophrenia; however, they may be used in specific cases to manage mood symptoms or as adjuncts. The evidence paths confirm the association of antipsychotics with schizophrenia treatment, particularly in managing neurobehavioral manifestations like hallucinations, while the paths related to antidepressants, antiepileptics, and mood stabilizers do not provide strong support for their primary use in treating schizophrenia.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

The mainstay of treatment for schizophrenia is antipsychotic medications, which work by targeting dopamine dysregulation in the brain. These medications are effective in reducing positive symptoms and may also help with negative and cognitive symptoms, although to a lesser extent. Antidepressants, antiepileptics, and mood stabilizers are not the primary treatments for schizophrenia. Antidepressants may be used adjunctively to treat comorbid depression, while antiepileptics and mood stabilizers might be used in specific cases to manage mood symptoms or as adjuncts, but they are not standard treatments for schizophrenia. Therefore, based on standard medical knowledge and consensus, antipsychotics are the primary treatment for schizophrenia.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
