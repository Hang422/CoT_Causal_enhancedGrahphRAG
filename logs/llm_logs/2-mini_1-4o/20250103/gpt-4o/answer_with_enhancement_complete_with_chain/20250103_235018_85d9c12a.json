Increases liver glycogenolysis\nopb. Causes broachiolar constriction\nopc. Evokes extrasystoles in the heart\nopd. Produces restlessness and anxiety\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nEpinephrine, when administered intravenously in high doses, primarily stimulates beta-adrenergic receptors, leading to increased heart rate and contractility, which can evoke extrasystoles in the heart. It also stimulates alpha-adrenergic receptors, resulting in increased liver glycogenolysis. Importantly, epinephrine stimulates beta-2 adrenergic receptors, causing bronchodilation, not bronchiolar constriction. Additionally, it activates the central nervous system, which can produce restlessness and anxiety. Therefore, the action that is not associated with high-dose epinephrine is 'causes bronchiolar constriction,' as it actually causes bronchodilation.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "
