Ascaris\nopb. Filariasis\nopc. Malaria\nopd. Oncocerciasis\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nIvermectin is an antiparasitic medication indicated for specific parasitic infections. It is effective against Onchocerciasis and Filariasis, both of which are caused by filarial worms. However, it is not indicated for Malaria, which is caused by Plasmodium species and requires different treatment options. The reasoning chains correctly identify that Ivermectin is not effective against Malaria, aligning with the consensus that it is not used for this condition. Therefore, the correct answer is that Ivermectin is indicated in all of the following except Malaria.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Ivermectin is an antiparasitic medication primarily used to treat infections caused by certain parasites. It is effective against Onchocerciasis (river blindness) and Filariasis, both of which are caused by filarial worms. It is also used for treating Ascaris infections, which are caused by roundworms. However, Ivermectin is not indicated for Malaria, as Malaria is caused by Plasmodium species, which are protozoan parasites, and requires antimalarial drugs such as chloroquine or artemisinin-based therapies. Therefore, based on standard medical knowledge and consensus, Ivermectin is not used for treating Malaria.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opc\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
