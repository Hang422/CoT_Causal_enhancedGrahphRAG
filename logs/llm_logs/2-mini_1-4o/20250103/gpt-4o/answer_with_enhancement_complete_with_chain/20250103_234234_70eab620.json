Acute renal failure\nopb. Development of antiplatelet antibodies\nopc. Encephalitis secondary to liver dysfunction\nopd. Hemorrhagic stroke\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nFibrinolytic drugs, used in the treatment of acute myocardial infarction, significantly increase the risk of bleeding complications due to their mechanism of action, which involves the dissolution of thrombi and restoration of blood flow. The most serious adverse effect associated with this therapy is hemorrhagic stroke, as evidenced by multiple reasoning chains indicating a direct correlation between fibrinolytic therapy and increased bleeding risk, particularly intracranial hemorrhage. The consensus in medical literature supports that the likelihood of hemorrhagic stroke is notably elevated in patients receiving fibrinolytics, making it the most probable adverse effect in this context.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Fibrinolytic drugs, such as tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), are used to dissolve clots in the treatment of acute myocardial infarction. The primary mechanism of these drugs is to enhance the conversion of plasminogen to plasmin, leading to the breakdown of fibrin clots. While effective in restoring blood flow, this mechanism also increases the risk of bleeding complications. Among the potential adverse effects, hemorrhagic stroke is the most serious and well-documented. This is due to the increased risk of intracranial bleeding associated with the systemic activation of fibrinolysis. Other options, such as acute renal failure, development of antiplatelet antibodies, and encephalitis secondary to liver dysfunction, are not commonly associated with fibrinolytic therapy. Therefore, based on standard medical knowledge and consensus, hemorrhagic stroke is the most likely adverse effect of fibrinolytic drugs in this context.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
