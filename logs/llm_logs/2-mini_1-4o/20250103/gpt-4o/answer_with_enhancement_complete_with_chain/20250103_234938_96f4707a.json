Endometrial carcinoma\nopc. >Carcinoma in contralateral breast\nopd. >Cataract\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nTamoxifen is associated with several adverse effects. The use of tamoxifen increases the risk of thromboembolism, which is a known adverse effect (CHAIN: 95%). It also has a documented association with an increased risk of endometrial carcinoma (CHAIN: 90%). The risk of carcinoma in the contralateral breast is considered a possible adverse effect, but it is less clearly established compared to the first two (CHAIN: 80%). Cataract development is recognized as a less commonly associated adverse effect of tamoxifen (CHAIN: 70%). Therefore, while thromboembolism, endometrial carcinoma, and contralateral breast carcinoma are all linked to tamoxifen use, cataracts are not as strongly associated, making it the exception among the listed options.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Tamoxifen is a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) used primarily in the treatment of estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer. It is well-documented that tamoxifen increases the risk of thromboembolism and endometrial carcinoma due to its estrogenic effects on the endometrium and its impact on coagulation pathways. The risk of developing carcinoma in the contralateral breast is not a typical adverse effect of tamoxifen; in fact, tamoxifen is often used to reduce the risk of breast cancer in the contralateral breast. Cataracts are a recognized but less common adverse effect of tamoxifen. Therefore, the most likely correct answer, based on standard medical knowledge and consensus, is that tamoxifen does not cause carcinoma in the contralateral breast as an adverse effect.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opc\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}\n```",
