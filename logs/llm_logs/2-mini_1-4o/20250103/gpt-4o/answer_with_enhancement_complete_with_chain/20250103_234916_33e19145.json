      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in the field of Biochemistry.\n                    You are a medical expert determining the final answer.\n\n            ### Instructions:\n            - Use standard medical knowledge as the primary guide.\n            - Consider enhanced information only if it aligns with consensus.\n            - If conflicting or unclear, present the most likely correct answer based on known facts.\n            - It's acceptable to show moderate confidence if the question is complex, but still choose one best answer.\n\n\n                    ### Question\n                    In this child Which of the following enzymes is likely to be deficient?\n\n                    ### Options\n                    opa. HGPRTase\nopb. Adenosine deaminase\nopc. APRTase\nopd. Acid maltase\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nThe child presents with symptoms that suggest a specific enzyme deficiency. The reasoning for each option is as follows: \n\n1. **HGPRTase**: The chain correctly identifies that a deficiency in HGPRTase leads to Lesch-Nyhan syndrome, characterized by hyperuricemia and neurological symptoms. This aligns with consensus knowledge regarding the condition. \n\n2. **Adenosine deaminase**: The reasoning chain accurately describes that a deficiency in adenosine deaminase results in severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), leading to the accumulation of toxic metabolites and impaired lymphocyte function. This is well-supported by medical consensus. \n\n3. **APRTase**: The chain suggests a possible deficiency of APRTase due to symptoms of kidney stones and hyperuricemia. While this is plausible, it is less common than the other conditions mentioned and may not be the primary concern in this context. \n\n4. **Acid maltase**: The reasoning correctly identifies that a deficiency in acid maltase leads to Pompe disease, which presents with muscle weakness and cardiomyopathy. This is consistent with established medical knowledge. \n\nIn summary, the most likely deficiencies based on the symptoms presented are HGPRTase and adenosine deaminase, with the former being associated with Lesch-Nyhan syndrome and the latter with SCID. The other options, while possible, are less likely given the context. Therefore, the most supported enzyme deficiency in this child is likely HGPRTase or adenosine deaminase, depending on the specific symptoms observed.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"To determine the enzyme deficiency in the child, we need to consider the symptoms typically associated with each enzyme deficiency. HGPRTase deficiency leads to Lesch-Nyhan syndrome, characterized by hyperuricemia, neurological symptoms, and self-mutilating behaviors. Adenosine deaminase deficiency results in severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), which presents with recurrent infections due to impaired lymphocyte function. APRTase deficiency can cause kidney stones and hyperuricemia, but it is less common and typically not associated with neurological symptoms. Acid maltase deficiency leads to Pompe disease, presenting with muscle weakness and cardiomyopathy. Given the context provided, the symptoms suggest a neurological and possibly hyperuricemic condition, which aligns most closely with HGPRTase deficiency. Therefore, the most likely enzyme deficiency in this child is HGPRTase, associated with Lesch-Nyhan syndrome.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
