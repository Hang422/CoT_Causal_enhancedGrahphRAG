Penicillin\nopb. Cotrimoxazole\nopc. Kanamycin\nopd. Levofloxacin\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nPneumonia caused by Pneumocystis carinii (now known as Pneumocystis jirovecii) is primarily seen in immunocompromised patients, particularly those with HIV/AIDS. The standard treatment for this type of pneumonia is Cotrimoxazole (a combination of trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole), which is effective against P. jirovecii. Other options such as Penicillin, Kanamycin, and Levofloxacin are not effective for this specific infection. The reasoning chains correctly highlight that Cotrimoxazole is the first-line treatment, while the other antibiotics listed are not indicated for P. carinii pneumonia. Evidence paths related to Cotrimoxazole's effectiveness support this consensus, while paths discussing Levofloxacin and Kanamycin do not provide relevant support for treating P. carinii pneumonia.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "
