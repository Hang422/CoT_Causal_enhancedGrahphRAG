Anti depressants\nopb. Anti psychotics\nopc. Anti epileptics\nopd. Mood stabilizers\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nSchizophrenia is primarily treated with anti-psychotic medications, which are effective in managing psychotic symptoms such as hallucinations and delusions. This aligns with the consensus that anti-psychotics are the first-line treatment for schizophrenia, improving overall functioning. While mood stabilizers may be beneficial for mood disturbances associated with schizophrenia, they are not considered first-line treatments and are less effective than anti-psychotics. Anti-depressants may be used for comorbid conditions but are not the primary treatment for schizophrenia, and their efficacy in this context is unclear. Anti-epileptics are not standard treatment for schizophrenia and have an uncertain role in management. Therefore, the most appropriate treatment option for schizophrenia is anti-psychotics.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "
