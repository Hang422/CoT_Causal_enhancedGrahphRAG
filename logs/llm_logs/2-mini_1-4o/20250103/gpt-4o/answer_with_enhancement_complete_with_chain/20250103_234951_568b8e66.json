Diclofenac\nopb. Acetaminophen\nopc. Ibuprofen\nopd. Naproxen\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nAcetaminophen is not classified as an NSAID and is known to cause less gastric irritation compared to traditional NSAIDs, making it the least likely to cause gastric irritation (85% confidence). Diclofenac, ibuprofen, and naproxen are all NSAIDs associated with varying degrees of gastric irritation, with diclofenac and naproxen having a higher risk of gastrointestinal side effects (70% confidence each), while ibuprofen has a moderate risk (75% confidence). Therefore, acetaminophen is the best option for minimizing gastric irritation.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The question asks which option causes the least gastric irritation. Acetaminophen is not an NSAID and is known for its minimal gastric irritation compared to NSAIDs, which are known to cause gastric irritation due to their mechanism of inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis. Among the options, diclofenac, ibuprofen, and naproxen are all NSAIDs, with naproxen generally having a higher risk of gastrointestinal side effects. Ibuprofen is considered to have a moderate risk, while diclofenac is also associated with gastric irritation. Given that acetaminophen is not an NSAID and is known for its lower risk of gastric irritation, it is the most likely correct answer. Therefore, based on standard medical knowledge and the enhanced information provided, acetaminophen is the best choice for minimizing gastric irritation.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
