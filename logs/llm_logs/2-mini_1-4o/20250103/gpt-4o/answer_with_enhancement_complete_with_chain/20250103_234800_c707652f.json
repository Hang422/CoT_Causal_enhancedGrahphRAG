Chlorothiazide\nopb. Beta blockers\nopc. ACE inhibitors\nopd. Amlodipine\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nSpironolactone is a potassium-sparing diuretic that increases potassium levels, leading to a risk of hyperkalemia. Chlorothiazide, a thiazide diuretic, decreases potassium levels and is not contraindicated with spironolactone. Beta blockers do not significantly affect potassium levels and are also not contraindicated. ACE inhibitors can increase potassium levels and may pose a risk of hyperkalemia when used with spironolactone, making them potentially contraindicated. Amlodipine does not affect potassium levels and is not contraindicated. Therefore, the drug that is contraindicated along with spironolactone is ACE inhibitors.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Spironolactone is a potassium-sparing diuretic that can lead to increased potassium levels in the blood, posing a risk of hyperkalemia. ACE inhibitors, such as lisinopril or enalapril, also have the potential to increase potassium levels. When used together, spironolactone and ACE inhibitors can significantly raise the risk of hyperkalemia, which can be dangerous. Therefore, the combination of spironolactone with ACE inhibitors is generally contraindicated or used with caution, especially in patients with other risk factors for hyperkalemia. Chlorothiazide, a thiazide diuretic, tends to lower potassium levels and is often used in combination with spironolactone to balance potassium levels. Beta blockers and amlodipine do not significantly affect potassium levels and are not contraindicated with spironolactone. Based on this understanding, the most likely correct option is ACE inhibitors.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opc\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
