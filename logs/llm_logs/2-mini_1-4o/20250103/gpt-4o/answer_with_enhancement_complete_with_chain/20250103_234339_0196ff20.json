Ototoxicity\nopb. Nephrotoxicity\nopc. Coasting effect\nopd. Pulmonary fibrosis\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nCisplatin is well-documented to cause ototoxicity, leading to hearing loss, and nephrotoxicity, which can result in renal impairment. The coasting effect, characterized by a delayed onset of toxicity after drug cessation, is not associated with Cisplatin but rather with other chemotherapeutic agents. Additionally, while pulmonary fibrosis is not typically linked to Cisplatin, it is more commonly associated with drugs like bleomycin. Therefore, the correct answer is that Cisplatin does not produce the coasting effect.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Cisplatin is a chemotherapeutic agent known for its side effects, including ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity. Ototoxicity can lead to hearing loss, while nephrotoxicity affects kidney function. The 'coasting effect' is not a recognized side effect of Cisplatin; it is more commonly associated with other chemotherapy drugs, such as taxanes. Pulmonary fibrosis is also not typically associated with Cisplatin; it is more commonly linked to drugs like bleomycin. Therefore, the side effect not produced by Cisplatin is the coasting effect.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opc\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
