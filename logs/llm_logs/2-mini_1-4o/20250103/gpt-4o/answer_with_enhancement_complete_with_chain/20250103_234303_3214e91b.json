INH\nopb. Erythromycin estolate\nopc. Pyrazinamide\nopd. Ethionamide\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nErythromycin estolate is well-documented to cause cholestatic jaundice due to its mechanism of inhibiting bile flow, leading to increased bilirubin levels. INH (Isoniazid) is associated with hepatotoxicity and can cause jaundice, but it is not primarily cholestatic. Pyrazinamide can lead to liver dysfunction and jaundice, but it is not specifically known for causing cholestatic jaundice. Ethionamide can cause liver toxicity and jaundice, but it is also not commonly associated with cholestatic jaundice. Therefore, among the options, Erythromycin estolate is the most frequent cause of cholestatic jaundice.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "
