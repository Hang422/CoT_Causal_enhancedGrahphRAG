Imiquimod\nopb. Podophylline\nopc. Interferon\nopd. Acyclovir\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nImiquimod is a topical immunomodulator specifically indicated for the treatment of genital warts. The reasoning chains confirm that while Podophylline is a topical treatment, it is not classified as an immunomodulator. Acyclovir is an antiviral medication used for herpes virus infections and is not relevant for genital warts. Interferon is not typically used topically for this condition. Therefore, the correct option is Imiquimod, which acts by enhancing the immune response against the wart-causing virus. The evidence paths support the role of Imiquimod as an immunologic adjuvant, reinforcing its use in treating genital warts.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The question asks for a topical immunomodulator used in the treatment of genital warts. Imiquimod is a well-known topical immunomodulator that is specifically indicated for this condition. It works by enhancing the body's immune response to the human papillomavirus (HPV), which causes genital warts. Podophylline, while used topically for warts, is not an immunomodulator. Acyclovir is an antiviral used for herpes infections, not warts. Interferon is not typically used topically for genital warts. Therefore, based on standard medical knowledge and the enhanced information provided, Imiquimod is the most appropriate choice.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
