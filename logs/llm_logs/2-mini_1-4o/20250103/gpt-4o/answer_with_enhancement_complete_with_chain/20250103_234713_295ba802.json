Vitamin A\nopb. Vitamin C\nopc. Vitamin D\nopd. Vitamin B12\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nVitamin D is well-supported in the literature for its role in enhancing insulin sensitivity, which can reduce the risk of insulin resistance, obesity, and metabolic syndrome. The reasoning chain for Vitamin D is consistent with consensus, as it directly links enhanced insulin sensitivity to lower obesity rates and decreased metabolic syndrome risk. In contrast, Vitamin C's antioxidant properties may reduce inflammation, but its impact on insulin resistance remains unclear, thus weakening its relevance. Vitamin A's role in immune function does not provide direct evidence for insulin resistance or obesity, making it less relevant. Vitamin B12 is essential for energy metabolism but lacks direct evidence linking it to insulin resistance or metabolic syndrome. Therefore, Vitamin D is the most relevant option supported by consensus and evidence.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Vitamin D is well-documented in medical literature for its role in enhancing insulin sensitivity, which can help reduce the risk of insulin resistance, obesity, and metabolic syndrome. This is supported by numerous studies that show a correlation between adequate Vitamin D levels and improved metabolic health. While Vitamin C has antioxidant properties that may indirectly affect metabolic health, its direct impact on insulin resistance is not well-established. Vitamin A is primarily involved in immune function and does not have a direct link to insulin resistance or metabolic syndrome. Vitamin B12 is crucial for energy metabolism but lacks direct evidence connecting it to insulin resistance or metabolic syndrome. Therefore, based on the consensus and available evidence, Vitamin D is the most relevant and supported option.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opc\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
