Haloperidol\nopb. Imipramine\nopc. Alprazolam\nopd. Methylphenidate\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nMethylphenidate is the first-line treatment for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), as supported by clinical guidelines. It is a central nervous system stimulant that effectively increases attention span and reduces impulsivity in patients with ADHD. Other options, such as Haloperidol (an antipsychotic), Imipramine (a tricyclic antidepressant), and Alprazolam (a benzodiazepine), are not indicated for the treatment of ADHD and are not considered first-line therapies. Methylphenidate is FDA-approved for ADHD and is widely prescribed, confirming its status as the drug of choice.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "
