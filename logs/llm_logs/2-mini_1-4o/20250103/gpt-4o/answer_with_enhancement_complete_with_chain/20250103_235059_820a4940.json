They are called as \"high ceiling\" diuretics\nopb. They act on Na+.K+.2Cl- symporter\nopc. They can cause hyperuricemia\nopd. Loop diuretics lead to hypercalcemia and hypomagnesimia\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nLoop diuretics are classified as 'high ceiling' diuretics because they can produce a significant diuretic effect. They act on the Na+.K+.2Cl- symporter in the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle, leading to increased excretion of sodium, potassium, and chloride. This mechanism can result in hyperuricemia due to decreased uric acid excretion. Importantly, loop diuretics typically cause hypocalcemia and hypomagnesemia, not hypercalcemia. Therefore, the statement that loop diuretics lead to hypercalcemia is incorrect and contradicts established pharmacological consensus.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "
