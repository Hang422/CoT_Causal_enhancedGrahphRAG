Hypoglycemia\nopb. Cinchonism\nopc. Arrhythmias\nopd. Sweating\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nThe administration of i.v. quinine can lead to a condition known as Cinchonism, which is characterized by symptoms such as restlessness, sweating, tinnitus, and headache. The reasoning chains indicate that both restlessness and sweating are common manifestations of Cinchonism, making it the most likely cause in this scenario. While hypoglycemia and arrhythmias are potential concerns with quinine, they are less directly associated with the specific symptoms of restlessness and sweating. Therefore, the best-supported conclusion is that the symptoms are primarily due to Cinchonism, aligning with established pharmacological consensus.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Quinine is known to cause several side effects, including hypoglycemia, cinchonism, and arrhythmias. Hypoglycemia is a well-documented side effect of quinine, especially when administered intravenously, and can lead to symptoms such as restlessness and sweating. Cinchonism, while associated with quinine, typically presents with symptoms like tinnitus, headache, and dizziness, rather than restlessness and sweating. Arrhythmias are serious but less likely to present with the specific symptoms of restlessness and sweating. Given the symptoms of restlessness and sweating, hypoglycemia is the most likely cause, as these are classic symptoms of low blood sugar levels. Therefore, the most likely cause of the patient's symptoms is hypoglycemia.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
