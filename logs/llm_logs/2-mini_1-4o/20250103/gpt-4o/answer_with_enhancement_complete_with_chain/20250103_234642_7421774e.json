You would be concerned about the use of this drug if the patient also had what comorbid condition\n\n                    ### Options\n                    opa. Glaucoma\nopb. Essential tremor\nopc. Diabetes\nopd. Supraventricular tachycardia\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nPropranolol is a non-selective beta-blocker that can have significant effects on various comorbid conditions. In patients with diabetes, propranolol can mask the symptoms of hypoglycemia, which poses a risk of unrecognized low blood sugar, making this a concerning comorbidity (80% confidence). In patients with supraventricular tachycardia, propranolol can lower heart rate, potentially worsening bradycardia, which is also a concern (75% confidence). However, propranolol is not contraindicated in glaucoma and can be used cautiously, indicating less concern compared to diabetes and supraventricular tachycardia (90% confidence). Essential tremor is generally treated with propranolol, and there are no significant concerns regarding its use in this condition. Therefore, the most concerning comorbidity when using propranolol prophylactically after a myocardial infarct is diabetes.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Propranolol is a non-selective beta-blocker that can affect various physiological systems. In the context of diabetes, propranolol can mask the adrenergic symptoms of hypoglycemia, such as tremors and palpitations, which are critical for diabetic patients to recognize low blood sugar levels. This masking effect can lead to unrecognized and potentially dangerous hypoglycemic episodes. While propranolol can be used in conditions like glaucoma and essential tremor without significant concern, and it is often used to manage supraventricular tachycardia, the risk it poses in diabetes due to hypoglycemia unawareness is a significant concern. Therefore, the most concerning comorbidity when using propranolol prophylactically after a myocardial infarct is diabetes.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opc\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
