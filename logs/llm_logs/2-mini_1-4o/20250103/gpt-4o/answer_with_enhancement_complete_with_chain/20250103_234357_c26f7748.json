Clonazepam\nopb. Sodium Valproate\nopc. Phenobarbitone\nopd. Ethosuximide\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nMyoclonus in children is often associated with epilepsy and can be effectively treated with certain anticonvulsants. Clonazepam is recognized as an effective treatment for myoclonic seizures, as it reduces myoclonic jerks and is commonly used in clinical practice. Sodium Valproate is also used for various seizure types, including some myoclonic cases, but is not as effective as Clonazepam for this specific condition. Phenobarbital is a barbiturate anticonvulsant that is less effective for myoclonic seizures and is not considered a first-line treatment. Ethosuximide primarily treats absence seizures and is not recommended for myoclonic seizures. Therefore, the best treatment option for myoclonus in children is Clonazepam, supported by its established efficacy in managing myoclonic seizures.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "
