Anti depressants\nopb. Anti psychotics\nopc. Anti epileptics\nopd. Mood stabilizers\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nSchizophrenia is primarily treated with anti-psychotics, which are effective in managing the core psychotic symptoms of the disorder. While mood disturbances can occur in schizophrenia, mood stabilizers are not considered first-line treatments; anti-psychotics are preferred. Anti-depressants may be used for comorbid conditions but are not the primary treatment for schizophrenia. Anti-epileptics are also not standard treatment for schizophrenia, despite some cases involving seizures. Overall, the consensus strongly supports the use of anti-psychotics as the mainstay of treatment for schizophrenia.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Schizophrenia is a chronic mental disorder characterized by symptoms such as delusions, hallucinations, and disorganized thinking. The primary treatment for managing these core psychotic symptoms is the use of anti-psychotic medications. These drugs help to reduce the intensity and frequency of psychotic episodes and are considered the first-line treatment for schizophrenia. While other medications like anti-depressants and mood stabilizers may be used to address specific symptoms or comorbid conditions, they are not the primary treatment for schizophrenia itself. Anti-epileptics are not typically used in the treatment of schizophrenia. Therefore, based on standard medical knowledge and consensus, anti-psychotics are the most appropriate treatment for schizophrenia.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
