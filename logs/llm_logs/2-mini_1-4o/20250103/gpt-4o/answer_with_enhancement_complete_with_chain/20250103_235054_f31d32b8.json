      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in the field of Biochemistry.\n                    You are a medical expert determining the final answer.\n\n            ### Instructions:\n            - Use standard medical knowledge as the primary guide.\n            - Consider enhanced information only if it aligns with consensus.\n            - If conflicting or unclear, present the most likely correct answer based on known facts.\n            - It's acceptable to show moderate confidence if the question is complex, but still choose one best answer.\n\n\n                    ### Question\n                    Hypermagnesemia may be observed in:\n\n                    ### Options\n                    opa. Hyperparathyroidism\nopb. Diabetes mellitus\nopc. Kwashiorkor\nopd. Primary aldosteronism\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nHypermagnesemia is characterized by elevated serum magnesium levels. The reasoning for each option is as follows: \n\n1. **Hyperparathyroidism**: This condition leads to increased bone resorption, which can release magnesium from bones, potentially resulting in elevated serum magnesium levels. This aligns with consensus, thus supporting the possibility of hypermagnesemia in this condition. \n\n2. **Diabetes mellitus**: While diabetes can lead to renal impairment, which may decrease magnesium excretion, the direct link to hypermagnesemia is less clear. The retrieved evidence path indicates that renal insufficiency can occur, but it does not definitively support hypermagnesemia as a common outcome. Therefore, this option is less certain. \n\n3. **Kwashiorkor**: This condition is associated with malnutrition and electrolyte imbalances, but the relationship with magnesium levels is unclear. There is no strong consensus supporting hypermagnesemia in this context, so this option is not supported. \n\n4. **Primary aldosteronism**: This condition is characterized by increased aldosterone secretion, which typically leads to increased renal excretion of magnesium, resulting in decreased serum magnesium levels. This contradicts the possibility of hypermagnesemia and is thus not supported. \n\nIn summary, hyperparathyroidism is the most likely condition associated with hypermagnesemia, while diabetes mellitus, kwashiorkor, and primary aldosteronism do not support this condition based on current consensus.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Hypermagnesemia, characterized by elevated serum magnesium levels, is most commonly associated with conditions that impair renal excretion of magnesium or increase its release into the bloodstream. Hyperparathyroidism can lead to increased bone resorption, potentially releasing magnesium into the bloodstream, which aligns with the possibility of hypermagnesemia. In contrast, diabetes mellitus, while it can lead to renal impairment, does not commonly result in hypermagnesemia. Kwashiorkor, associated with malnutrition, does not have a strong link to hypermagnesemia. Primary aldosteronism typically results in increased renal excretion of magnesium, leading to lower serum magnesium levels. Therefore, based on standard medical knowledge and the enhanced information provided, hyperparathyroidism is the most likely condition to be associated with hypermagnesemia.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
