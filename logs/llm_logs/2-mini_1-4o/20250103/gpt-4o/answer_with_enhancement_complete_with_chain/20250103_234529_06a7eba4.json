Arachidonic acid\nopb. Cholesterol\nopc. Palmitic acid\nopd. Stearic acid\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nArachidonic acid is an unsaturated fatty acid that can increase membrane fluidity due to its kinked structure, which prevents tight packing of phospholipids, thus enhancing cell signaling. Cholesterol, while important for maintaining membrane integrity, actually decreases fluidity at high concentrations by filling spaces between phospholipids, leading to increased rigidity. Both palmitic acid and stearic acid are saturated fatty acids, which contribute to decreased membrane fluidity and increased rigidity due to their straight-chain structure that allows for tight packing. Therefore, the correct answer to the question is 'Arachidonic acid' as it is the only option that increases plasma membrane fluidity.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The fluidity of the plasma membrane is influenced by the types of fatty acids present in the phospholipids. Unsaturated fatty acids, like arachidonic acid, have one or more double bonds that introduce kinks in their structure, preventing tight packing of the lipid molecules and thus increasing membrane fluidity. In contrast, saturated fatty acids such as palmitic acid and stearic acid have straight chains that allow for tight packing, reducing fluidity. Cholesterol has a complex role; it can both increase and decrease fluidity depending on the temperature and concentration, but generally, at physiological temperatures, it tends to stabilize the membrane and decrease fluidity. Therefore, based on standard medical knowledge and the enhanced information provided, arachidonic acid is the most likely to increase membrane fluidity.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
