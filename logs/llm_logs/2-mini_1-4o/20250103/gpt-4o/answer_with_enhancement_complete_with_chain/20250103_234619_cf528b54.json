This results in the production of dilute urine, characterized by low urine osmolality. The standard consensus indicates that urine osmolality in Diabetes insipidus is typically less than 300 mmol/L, often around 100-200 mmol/L. Therefore, the most accurate option reflecting this consensus is <300 mmol/L. The other options, while they may reflect varying degrees of dilution, do not align with the established understanding of urine osmolality in this condition.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Diabetes insipidus is characterized by a deficiency in antidiuretic hormone (ADH), which leads to the production of large volumes of dilute urine. This results in low urine osmolality because the kidneys are unable to concentrate urine effectively. The standard medical consensus is that urine osmolality in Diabetes insipidus is typically less than 300 mmol/L, often around 100-200 mmol/L. This aligns with the enhanced information provided, which supports the understanding that urine osmolality in this condition is significantly lower than normal. Therefore, the most accurate option reflecting this consensus is <300 mmol/L.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
