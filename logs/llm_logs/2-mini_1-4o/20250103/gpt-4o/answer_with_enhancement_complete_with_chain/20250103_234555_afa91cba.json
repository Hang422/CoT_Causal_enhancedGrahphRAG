Collecting duct\nopb. Glomerulus\nopc. Proximal convoluted tubule\nopd. Loop of Henle\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nAldosterone is a hormone secreted by the adrenal glands that primarily acts on the kidneys, specifically at the collecting duct of the nephron. It regulates sodium and potassium levels by promoting sodium reabsorption and increasing water retention, which is crucial for maintaining fluid balance. The reasoning chains correctly identify the collecting duct as the primary site of action for aldosterone, with consensus supporting its role in influencing electrolyte balance and fluid homeostasis. Evidence paths related to renal tubule structure confirm the relevance of the collecting duct in aldosterone's function, while broader paths regarding cytoprotection and excretory function do not directly clarify the specific action of aldosterone.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Aldosterone is a hormone produced by the adrenal glands that primarily acts on the distal parts of the nephron in the kidney, specifically the collecting duct. Its main function is to increase sodium reabsorption and potassium excretion, which in turn helps regulate blood pressure and fluid balance. The enhanced information aligns with standard medical knowledge, confirming that the collecting duct is the primary site of action for aldosterone. Other parts of the nephron, such as the glomerulus, proximal convoluted tubule, and loop of Henle, are not the primary sites for aldosterone's action. Therefore, the most likely correct answer, based on consensus and standard medical knowledge, is that aldosterone acts at the collecting duct.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
