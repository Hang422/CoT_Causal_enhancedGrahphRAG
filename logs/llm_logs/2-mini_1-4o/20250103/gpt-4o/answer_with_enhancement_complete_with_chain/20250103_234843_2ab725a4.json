Aprepitant\nopb. Dexamethasone\nopc. Ondansetrin\nopd. All of the above\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nAprepitant, Dexamethasone, and Ondansetron are all used in the management of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting. Aprepitant is a substance P antagonist that effectively reduces nausea and vomiting associated with chemotherapy. Dexamethasone, a corticosteroid, has anti-inflammatory properties that can help alleviate nausea in this context. Ondansetron is a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist that is commonly used to prevent nausea and vomiting during chemotherapy. Therefore, the option 'All of the above' is correct as it encompasses all three agents, each contributing to the management of chemotherapy-induced vomiting.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) is a common side effect of cancer treatment, and its management often requires a combination of medications. Aprepitant is a neurokinin-1 (NK1) receptor antagonist that is effective in preventing both acute and delayed CINV. Dexamethasone, a corticosteroid, is frequently used in combination with other antiemetics to enhance their efficacy. Ondansetron is a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist that is widely used to prevent acute CINV. The use of these three drugs together is a well-established regimen for managing CINV, as they target different pathways involved in nausea and vomiting. Therefore, the option 'All of the above' is correct, as it includes all three agents that are commonly used in this context.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
