Naltrexone\nopb. Acamprosate\nopc. Flumazenil\nopd. Disulfiram\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nNaltrexone is an opioid receptor antagonist that reduces cravings for alcohol and is used in the treatment of alcohol dependence. Acamprosate helps maintain abstinence from alcohol and is also indicated for alcohol dependence. Disulfiram works by causing unpleasant reactions when alcohol is consumed, thus deterring drinking, and is used in alcohol dependence treatment. In contrast, Flumazenil is a benzodiazepine antagonist primarily used to reverse the effects of benzodiazepine overdose and is not indicated for the treatment of alcohol dependence. Therefore, the correct answer is Flumazenil, as it does not have a role in treating alcohol dependence.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"In the treatment of alcohol dependence, several medications are commonly used. Naltrexone is an opioid receptor antagonist that helps reduce cravings for alcohol. Acamprosate is used to maintain abstinence from alcohol by modulating neurotransmitter systems. Disulfiram works by causing unpleasant reactions when alcohol is consumed, thereby deterring drinking. Flumazenil, on the other hand, is a benzodiazepine antagonist used primarily to reverse benzodiazepine overdose and has no role in the treatment of alcohol dependence. Therefore, based on standard medical knowledge and consensus, Flumazenil is not used to treat alcohol dependence.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opc\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
