Methotrexate\nopb. Doxorubicin\nopc. Cisplatin\nopd. Busulfan\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nMethotrexate and Busulfan are both known to cause pulmonary toxicity and can lead to pulmonary fibrosis, aligning with consensus in pharmacology. Doxorubicin is associated with various pulmonary complications but is less commonly linked to pulmonary fibrosis, indicating a lower risk. Cisplatin can cause lung toxicity but is not typically associated with pulmonary fibrosis. Therefore, the strongest associations with pulmonary fibrosis are with Methotrexate and Busulfan.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Pulmonary fibrosis is a known complication of certain drugs due to their pulmonary toxicity. Methotrexate and Busulfan are both well-documented in causing pulmonary fibrosis. Methotrexate, an immunosuppressant and chemotherapeutic agent, is associated with pulmonary toxicity, including fibrosis, especially with long-term use. Busulfan, an alkylating agent used in chemotherapy, is also strongly linked to pulmonary fibrosis. Doxorubicin and Cisplatin, while they can cause lung toxicity, are less commonly associated with pulmonary fibrosis. Given the enhanced information and standard medical knowledge, Busulfan is more specifically and consistently associated with pulmonary fibrosis compared to Methotrexate, which can cause a broader range of pulmonary issues. Therefore, the most likely correct answer is Busulfan.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}",
