Tyrosine transaminase\nopb. Tyrosine hydroxylase\nopc. Phenylalanine hydroxylase\nopd. Phenylketonuria hydroxylase\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nPhenylketonuria (PKU) is primarily caused by a deficiency of phenylalanine hydroxylase, an enzyme responsible for converting phenylalanine to tyrosine. This deficiency leads to the accumulation of phenylalanine in the blood, which can result in neurological damage if not managed. The condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner, meaning that both copies of the gene must be mutated for the disorder to manifest. The reasoning chains correctly identify phenylalanine hydroxylase as the deficient enzyme in PKU, and the evidence paths support the relationship between phenylalanine metabolism and the disorder. Other options, such as tyrosine transaminase and tyrosine hydroxylase, are not directly related to the cause of PKU.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

This enzyme is crucial for converting the amino acid phenylalanine into tyrosine. When phenylalanine hydroxylase is deficient, phenylalanine accumulates in the body, leading to potential neurological damage if not managed through dietary restrictions. The enhanced information aligns with standard medical knowledge, confirming that phenylalanine hydroxylase is the enzyme deficient in PKU. Other enzymes listed, such as tyrosine transaminase and tyrosine hydroxylase, are not involved in the primary metabolic pathway affected in PKU.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opc\",\n  \"confidence\": 100\n}\n```",
