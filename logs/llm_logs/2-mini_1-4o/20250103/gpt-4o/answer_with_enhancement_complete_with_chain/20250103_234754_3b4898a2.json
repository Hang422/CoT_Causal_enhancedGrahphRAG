Meningitis\nopb. Pericarditis\nopc. Ileo-caecal tuberculosis\nopd. Adrenal involvement\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nSteroids are indicated in certain forms of tuberculosis to manage inflammation and prevent complications. In the case of meningitis, steroids are used to reduce inflammation and improve neurological outcomes. For pericarditis, they help decrease pericardial inflammation and lower the risk of cardiac complications. However, in ileo-caecal tuberculosis, steroids are not typically indicated due to the risk of exacerbating the infection and worsening the disease. In adrenal involvement, steroids are necessary to address adrenal insufficiency and restore hormonal balance. Therefore, the correct answer is ileo-caecal tuberculosis, as steroids are contraindicated in this condition.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

In tuberculous meningitis, steroids are indicated to reduce inflammation and improve neurological outcomes. In tuberculous pericarditis, they help decrease pericardial inflammation and lower the risk of cardiac complications. In cases of adrenal involvement, steroids are necessary to address adrenal insufficiency due to the destruction of adrenal tissue by the infection. However, in ileo-caecal tuberculosis, the use of steroids is not typically indicated because they can exacerbate the infection and worsen the disease.
