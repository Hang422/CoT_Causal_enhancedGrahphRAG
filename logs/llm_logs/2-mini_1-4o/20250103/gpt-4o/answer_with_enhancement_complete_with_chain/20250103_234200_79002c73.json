Bromocriptine\nopb. Haloperidol\nopc. Reserpine\nopd. Chlorpromazine\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nBromocriptine is a dopamine agonist that inhibits prolactin secretion, thus it does not cause hyperprolactinemia. Haloperidol and Chlorpromazine are both dopamine antagonists that increase prolactin levels, leading to hyperprolactinemia. Reserpine depletes monoamines, which may affect dopamine levels and could potentially lead to increased prolactin, but the effect is unclear. Therefore, the only drug listed that does not cause hyperprolactinemia is Bromocriptine.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The question asks which drug does not cause hyperprolactinemia. Bromocriptine is a dopamine agonist, which means it stimulates dopamine receptors. Dopamine inhibits prolactin secretion, so Bromocriptine actually reduces prolactin levels and is used to treat conditions like hyperprolactinemia. On the other hand, Haloperidol and Chlorpromazine are dopamine antagonists, which block dopamine receptors and can lead to increased prolactin levels, causing hyperprolactinemia. Reserpine works by depleting monoamines, including dopamine, which could potentially lead to increased prolactin levels, although its effect on prolactin is less direct and not as well characterized as the other two. Therefore, based on standard pharmacological knowledge, Bromocriptine is the drug that does not cause hyperprolactinemia.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
