It follows zero order kinetics\nopb. Not an hepatic enzyme inducer\nopc. It is excreted unchanged in urine\nopd. It is not teratogenic\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nPhenytoin is an anticonvulsant medication that exhibits nonlinear pharmacokinetics, specifically zero-order kinetics at therapeutic levels, which means that its metabolism is saturated at higher concentrations. This supports option 'opa' as true. However, phenytoin is a known hepatic enzyme inducer, contradicting option 'opb'. It is primarily metabolized in the liver, with only a small fraction excreted unchanged in urine, thus option 'opc' is false. Additionally, phenytoin is teratogenic and can cause fetal hydantoin syndrome, making option 'opd' incorrect. Therefore, the only true statement is that phenytoin follows zero-order kinetics.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "
