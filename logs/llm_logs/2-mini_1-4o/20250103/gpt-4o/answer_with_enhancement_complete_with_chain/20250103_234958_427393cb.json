Succinylcholine\nopb. Tubocurare\nopc. Pyridostigmine\nopd. Halothane\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nIn myasthenia gravis, an autoimmune neuromuscular disorder characterized by muscle weakness, certain drugs can exacerbate symptoms or lead to respiratory failure. Succinylcholine is a neuromuscular blocker that can cause muscle paralysis and is contraindicated due to the risk of worsening weakness in these patients. Tubocurare, another neuromuscular blocker, can also lead to respiratory muscle weakness, making it unsuitable for myasthenia gravis patients. Pyridostigmine, a cholinesterase inhibitor, is commonly used to improve neuromuscular transmission and is generally safe for these patients. Halothane, while a volatile anesthetic that may cause muscle relaxation, is not specifically contraindicated but requires caution in myasthenia gravis patients. Therefore, the drugs contraindicated in myasthenia gravis are Succinylcholine and Tubocurare.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"In myasthenia gravis, the primary concern is avoiding drugs that can exacerbate muscle weakness or lead to respiratory failure. Succinylcholine is a depolarizing neuromuscular blocker that can cause prolonged muscle paralysis in patients with myasthenia gravis due to their altered neuromuscular transmission. This makes it contraindicated in these patients. Tubocurare, a non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocker, can also exacerbate muscle weakness, but it is not as commonly highlighted as succinylcholine in this context. Pyridostigmine is actually used to treat myasthenia gravis, as it enhances neuromuscular transmission. Halothane, while it can cause muscle relaxation, is not specifically contraindicated but should be used with caution. Based on standard medical knowledge and consensus, succinylcholine is the most clearly contraindicated drug in myasthenia gravis.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}\n```",
