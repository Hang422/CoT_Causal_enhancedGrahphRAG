Mouth\nopb. Stomach\nopc. Small intestine\nopd. Large intestine\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nDisaccharides are primarily digested in the small intestine. While salivary amylase begins the breakdown of carbohydrates in the mouth, it does not fully digest disaccharides. The stomach does not contribute to the digestion of disaccharides due to its acidic environment, which does not activate the necessary enzymes. Instead, disaccharides are further processed in the small intestine, where specific enzymes such as maltase, sucrase, and lactase break them down into monosaccharides. This aligns with the consensus that the small intestine is the main site for disaccharide digestion.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The digestion of disaccharides primarily occurs in the small intestine. This is because the small intestine contains specific enzymes such as maltase, sucrase, and lactase that are responsible for breaking down disaccharides into monosaccharides. While the mouth initiates carbohydrate digestion with salivary amylase, it does not fully digest disaccharides. The stomach's acidic environment is not conducive to disaccharide digestion, as it lacks the necessary enzymes. The large intestine is involved in water absorption and does not play a role in the digestion of disaccharides. Therefore, based on standard medical knowledge and consensus, the small intestine is the main site for disaccharide digestion.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opc\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
