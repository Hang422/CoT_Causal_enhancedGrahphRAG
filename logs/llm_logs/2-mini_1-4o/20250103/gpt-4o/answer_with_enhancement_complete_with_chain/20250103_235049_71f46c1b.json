Vitamin B9\nopb. Vitamin B12\nopc. Vitamin B6\nopd. Vitamin B3\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nIsoniazid is known to interfere with the metabolism of vitamin B6 (pyridoxine), leading to decreased levels and an increased risk of deficiency. This is particularly relevant as vitamin B6 is crucial for various metabolic processes, and its deficiency can result in peripheral neuropathy. The reasoning chains consistently indicate that isoniazid affects vitamin B6 metabolism, with a high likelihood of deficiency observed in patients receiving this medication. Therefore, the most likely vitamin deficiency seen in patients on isoniazid is vitamin B6.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Isoniazid is an antibiotic commonly used in the treatment of tuberculosis. It is well-documented in medical literature that isoniazid can interfere with the metabolism of vitamin B6 (pyridoxine). This interference occurs because isoniazid forms a complex with pyridoxal phosphate, the active form of vitamin B6, leading to its increased excretion and reduced availability in the body. As a result, patients on isoniazid therapy are at risk of developing vitamin B6 deficiency, which can manifest as peripheral neuropathy, among other symptoms. This is a widely accepted and well-understood interaction in pharmacology, making vitamin B6 deficiency the most likely to be observed in patients taking isoniazid.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opc\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
