Dexamethasone\nopb. Betamethasone\nopc. Hydrocoisone\nopd. Prednisolone\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nIn cases of suspected congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) in a pregnant female, the primary goal is to prevent fetal virilization due to excess androgen exposure. Dexamethasone is the drug of choice as it effectively reduces androgen production from the adrenal glands. The reasoning chains correctly identify that while hydrocortisone is used for adrenal insufficiency, it is not the first-line treatment for preventing virilization in this context. Betamethasone is primarily indicated for fetal lung maturity and is not appropriate for CAH management. Prednisolone is less effective than dexamethasone for this condition. Therefore, the consensus supports the use of dexamethasone as the preferred treatment to manage the risk of virilization in the fetus.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) is a genetic disorder affecting adrenal steroid synthesis, often leading to excess androgen production. In a pregnant female suspected of carrying a fetus with CAH, the primary concern is preventing virilization of a female fetus. Dexamethasone is the drug of choice because it crosses the placenta and suppresses fetal adrenal androgen production, thereby reducing the risk of virilization. While hydrocortisone is used for adrenal insufficiency, it is not effective in preventing fetal virilization. Betamethasone is used for promoting fetal lung maturity and is not suitable for CAH management. Prednisolone is less effective than dexamethasone in this context because it is metabolized by the placenta and does not adequately suppress fetal adrenal androgens. Therefore, based on standard medical knowledge and consensus, dexamethasone is the most appropriate choice for managing the risk of virilization in a fetus suspected of having CAH.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
