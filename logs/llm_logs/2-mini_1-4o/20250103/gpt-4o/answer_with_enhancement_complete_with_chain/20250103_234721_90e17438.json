Fever\nopb. Peptic ulcer\nopc. Unstable angina\nopd. Myalgia\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nAspirin is contraindicated in peptic ulcer due to its potential to cause gastrointestinal irritation and increase the risk of bleeding, which can exacerbate ulcer conditions. In unstable angina, aspirin is beneficial as it provides cardiovascular protection and is not contraindicated. Myalgia is not a contraindication for aspirin, as it can be used to reduce inflammation. Regarding fever, while aspirin can cause Reye's syndrome in children, it is not universally contraindicated in fever for adults; however, caution is advised in pediatric cases. Therefore, the strongest contraindication for aspirin is in peptic ulcer.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Aspirin is known to cause gastrointestinal irritation and can increase the risk of bleeding, which makes it contraindicated in patients with peptic ulcers. This is a well-established medical principle due to the potential for exacerbating ulcer conditions. In the case of unstable angina, aspirin is actually indicated as it provides cardiovascular protection by inhibiting platelet aggregation. Myalgia is not a contraindication for aspirin, as it can be used to alleviate pain and inflammation. While aspirin is not universally contraindicated in fever, caution is advised in pediatric cases due to the risk of Reye's syndrome. However, the strongest and most clear contraindication among the options provided is peptic ulcer.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
