This hormone is:\n\n                    ### Options\n                    opa. Endothelial growth factor (EGF)\nopb. Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG)\nopc. Human chorionic somatotropin (HCS)\nopd. Relaxin\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nThe placenta secretes several hormones during pregnancy, with human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) being the primary hormone utilized for early pregnancy detection. hCG is specifically produced by the placenta shortly after implantation and its levels rise significantly in early pregnancy. This hormone is detected in urine tests, which confirm pregnancy. The reasoning chains consistently highlight that hCG is the key hormone for pregnancy detection, supported by evidence showing its interaction with renal tissue during urinalysis and its presence in pregnancy tests. Other options, such as endothelial growth factor (EGF), human chorionic somatotropin (HCS), and relaxin, do not play a role in early pregnancy detection. Therefore, the correct answer is human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG).\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The placenta secretes several hormones during pregnancy, but the hormone specifically utilized for early detection of pregnancy is human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). hCG is produced by the placenta shortly after implantation and is the hormone detected in both blood and urine pregnancy tests. This is a well-established fact in medical science, and there is a strong consensus that hCG is the key hormone for early pregnancy detection. Other hormones like endothelial growth factor (EGF), human chorionic somatotropin (HCS), and relaxin do not play a role in the early detection of pregnancy. Therefore, based on standard medical knowledge and the enhanced information provided, the most likely correct answer is human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG).\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 100\n}",
