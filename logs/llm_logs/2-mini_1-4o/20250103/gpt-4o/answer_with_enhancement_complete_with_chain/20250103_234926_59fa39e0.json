Thiothixanthene\nopb. Phenothiazine\nopc. Butyrophenone\nopd. Diphenyl butyl piperidine\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nPimozide is an antipsychotic medication primarily used to treat Tourette syndrome and is classified as a butyrophenone. The reasoning chains confirm that Pimozide acts as a dopamine receptor antagonist, which is characteristic of butyrophenones, and it is not classified under phenothiazines, thiothixanthenes, or diphenyl butyl piperidines. The evidence paths support its classification as an antipsychotic and its interaction with dopamine antagonists, reinforcing its categorization as a butyrophenone.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Pimozide is an antipsychotic medication used primarily for the treatment of Tourette syndrome. It functions as a dopamine receptor antagonist. The classification of antipsychotic drugs is based on their chemical structure and mechanism of action. Pimozide is classified as a diphenyl butyl piperidine, not a butyrophenone. This classification is distinct from other classes such as phenothiazines, thiothixanthenes, and butyrophenones. The enhanced information incorrectly categorizes pimozide as a butyrophenone, which is not supported by standard pharmacological classification. Therefore, the correct classification for pimozide is diphenyl butyl piperidine.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
