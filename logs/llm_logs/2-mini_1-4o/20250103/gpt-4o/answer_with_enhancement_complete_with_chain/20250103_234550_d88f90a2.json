Alpha IEN\nopb. Beta IFN\nopc. Gamma IFN\nopd. Natalizumab\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nIn the management of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS), disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) are essential. Beta interferon (Beta IFN) is widely recognized as a first-line treatment option, supported by clinical guidelines and evidence demonstrating its efficacy in reducing relapse rates and improving long-term outcomes. Natalizumab is effective for severe cases of RRMS but is not considered a first-line treatment for all patients due to its risk profile and potential for serious side effects. Gamma interferon (Gamma IFN) is not commonly used in RRMS management and lacks sufficient evidence for efficacy, making it a less preferred option. Therefore, the most appropriate drug of choice for RRMS is Beta IFN, as it aligns with established medical consensus.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

It has been extensively studied and is supported by clinical guidelines due to its efficacy and safety profile. Natalizumab, while effective, is typically reserved for more severe cases or when patients do not respond to first-line treatments due to its risk of serious side effects, such as progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). Gamma interferon (Gamma IFN) is not used in the treatment of RRMS and lacks evidence of efficacy.
