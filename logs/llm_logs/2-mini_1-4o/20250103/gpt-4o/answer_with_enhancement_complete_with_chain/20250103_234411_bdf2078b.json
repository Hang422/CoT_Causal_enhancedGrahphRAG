Protein C deficiency\nopb. Protein S deficiency\nopc. Hemophillia\nopd. Antithrombin III deficiency\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nWarfarin-induced skin necrosis is primarily associated with deficiencies in Protein C and Protein S. Warfarin inhibits vitamin K-dependent clotting factors, leading to a decrease in Protein C levels, which can precipitate thrombosis and subsequent skin necrosis. Protein C deficiency is a well-established risk factor for this complication, as it can lead to purpura fulminans, a severe form of skin necrosis. Protein S deficiency also contributes to this risk, as it is a cofactor for Protein C. In contrast, Hemophilia and Antithrombin III deficiency are not typically associated with warfarin-induced skin necrosis. Hemophilia primarily affects the intrinsic pathway of coagulation and does not lead to skin necrosis in the context of warfarin use. Antithrombin III deficiency is more related to thrombotic events but does not directly correlate with skin necrosis due to warfarin. Therefore, the most relevant options are Protein C and Protein S deficiencies.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Warfarin-induced skin necrosis is a rare but serious complication that occurs due to the imbalance in coagulation factors when warfarin therapy is initiated. Warfarin inhibits vitamin K-dependent clotting factors, including factors II, VII, IX, and X, as well as proteins C and S. Protein C is a natural anticoagulant, and its levels drop faster than the procoagulant factors when warfarin is started, leading to a transient hypercoagulable state. This is particularly problematic in individuals with an underlying Protein C deficiency, as they are unable to adequately counteract the procoagulant effects, leading to thrombosis and skin necrosis. While Protein S deficiency can also contribute to this risk, Protein C deficiency is more directly implicated in the pathogenesis of warfarin-induced skin necrosis. Hemophilia and Antithrombin III deficiency are not typically associated with this condition. Therefore, the most likely correct answer is Protein C deficiency.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
