Morphine patch\nopb. Diazepam\nopc. Clobazam\nopd. Haloperidol\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nIn palliative care for lung cancer patients experiencing dyspnoea, the use of a morphine patch is well-supported by consensus as it effectively decreases the perception of breathlessness, leading to reduced dyspnoea. This aligns with evidence indicating that morphine can prevent dyspnoea. Diazepam and clobazam may provide some relief through their anxiolytic effects, potentially improving comfort related to anxiety, but their direct impact on dyspnoea is less established, with diazepam showing a possible improvement in comfort but not specifically targeting dyspnoea. Haloperidol, while it may reduce anxiety, has an unclear impact on dyspnoea and is not typically used for this purpose. Therefore, the most effective option for palliation of dyspnoea in this context is the morphine patch.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"In the management of dyspnoea in lung cancer patients, the primary goal is to alleviate the sensation of breathlessness. Morphine, an opioid, is well-documented in palliative care for its ability to reduce the perception of dyspnoea by acting on the central nervous system to decrease the sensation of breathlessness. This is supported by a strong consensus in medical literature. While diazepam and clobazam can help with anxiety, which may indirectly improve comfort, they do not directly address the physiological sensation of dyspnoea. Haloperidol is primarily used for agitation and delirium, with no established role in the direct management of dyspnoea. Therefore, the morphine patch is the most effective and well-supported option for palliation of dyspnoea in this context.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
