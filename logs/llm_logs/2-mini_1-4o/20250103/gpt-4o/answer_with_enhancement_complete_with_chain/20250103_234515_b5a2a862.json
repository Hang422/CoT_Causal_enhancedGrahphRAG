Duodenum\nopb. Ileum\nopc. Jejunum\nopd. Colon\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nVitamin B12 absorption requires intrinsic factor, which is produced in the stomach and binds to vitamin B12 to form a complex. This complex is then transported to the ileum, where absorption occurs. All reasoning chains correctly identify the ileum as the site of absorption for the intrinsic factor-B12 complex, aligning with medical consensus. Evidence paths supporting the role of intrinsic factor in the uptake process in the ileum further confirm this. Therefore, the correct answer is that vitamin B12 intrinsic factor absorption occurs in the ileum.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Vitamin B12 absorption is a well-understood physiological process. The intrinsic factor, produced by the parietal cells in the stomach, binds to vitamin B12, forming a complex that is resistant to digestion in the upper gastrointestinal tract. This complex travels through the small intestine to the ileum, where specific receptors facilitate its absorption. The enhanced information provided aligns with the standard medical consensus that the ileum is the site of vitamin B12 absorption. There is no significant controversy or complexity in this process, making the ileum the most likely correct answer.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 100\n}",
