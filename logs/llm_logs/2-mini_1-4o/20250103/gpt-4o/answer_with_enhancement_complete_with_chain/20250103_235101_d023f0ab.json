HDL\nopb. LDL\nopc. VLDL\nopd. Chylomicrons\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nCholesterol is synthesized in the liver and needs to be transported to peripheral tissues. The primary carrier of cholesterol in the bloodstream is Low-Density Lipoprotein (LDL), which delivers cholesterol to cells. While Very Low-Density Lipoprotein (VLDL) primarily carries triglycerides, it is converted to LDL after triglyceride removal, further supporting LDL's role in cholesterol transport. High-Density Lipoprotein (HDL) primarily functions to remove excess cholesterol from tissues rather than transport it from the liver. Chylomicrons are involved in transporting dietary lipids rather than liver-derived cholesterol. Therefore, the correct answer is LDL, as it is the main transporter of cholesterol from the liver to peripheral tissues.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Cholesterol is synthesized in the liver and needs to be transported to peripheral tissues for various cellular functions. The primary lipoprotein responsible for this transport is Low-Density Lipoprotein (LDL). LDL is known for its role in delivering cholesterol to cells throughout the body. While Very Low-Density Lipoprotein (VLDL) also carries lipids, its main function is to transport triglycerides, and it is eventually converted into LDL after triglyceride removal. High-Density Lipoprotein (HDL) is primarily involved in reverse cholesterol transport, which means it carries cholesterol away from peripheral tissues back to the liver. Chylomicrons are responsible for transporting dietary lipids from the intestines, not liver-derived cholesterol. Therefore, based on standard medical knowledge and consensus, LDL is the main transporter of cholesterol from the liver to peripheral tissues.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
