Cough suppression\nopb. Anti-emesis\nopc. Miosis\nopd. Truncal rigidity\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nOpioids are known for several pharmacological actions. They effectively suppress cough (cough suppression), which is a recognized action of opioids. They can also induce nausea, but they are sometimes used in anti-emetic contexts, although this is not their primary use. Miosis, or pupil constriction, is a well-documented effect of opioids. Truncal rigidity, while a possible side effect of opioids, is not considered a primary pharmacological action. Therefore, the option that is NOT a pharmacological action of opioids is 'anti-emesis,' as it is not primarily associated with their therapeutic use, despite some overlap with nausea management.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Opioids have several well-documented pharmacological actions. They are known to suppress cough (cough suppression), cause miosis (pupil constriction), and can lead to truncal rigidity as a side effect. However, opioids are not primarily used for anti-emesis; in fact, they often cause nausea and vomiting as side effects. While they may be used in some contexts to manage nausea, this is not a primary pharmacological action. Therefore, the option that is NOT a pharmacological action of opioids is 'anti-emesis.' This aligns with the consensus that opioids are more likely to induce nausea rather than prevent it.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
