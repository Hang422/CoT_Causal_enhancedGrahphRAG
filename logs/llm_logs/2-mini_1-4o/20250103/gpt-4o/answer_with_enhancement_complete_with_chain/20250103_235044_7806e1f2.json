Stroma\nopb. Corpora albicans\nopc. Corpora lutea\nopd. Mature follicles\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nProgesterone is primarily produced in the ovaries by the corpus luteum, which forms after ovulation from the mature follicle. The stroma of the ovary serves as supportive tissue and does not primarily produce hormones. The corpora albicans is a degenerated form of the corpus luteum and does not produce significant amounts of progesterone. Mature follicles are involved in ovulation but do not produce progesterone; this function is taken over by the corpus luteum post-ovulation. Therefore, the correct answer is that progesterone production in the ovary is primarily by the corpus lutea.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Progesterone is a hormone that plays a crucial role in the menstrual cycle and in maintaining the early stages of pregnancy. In the ovary, progesterone is primarily produced by the corpus luteum, which forms from the remnants of the mature follicle after ovulation. The corpus luteum is responsible for secreting progesterone to prepare the endometrium for potential implantation of an embryo. The stroma of the ovary serves as supportive tissue and does not primarily produce hormones. The corpora albicans is the scar tissue that forms after the corpus luteum degenerates and does not produce significant amounts of progesterone. Mature follicles are involved in the process leading up to ovulation but do not produce progesterone; this function is taken over by the corpus luteum post-ovulation. Therefore, based on standard medical knowledge and consensus, the corpus luteum is the primary source of progesterone production in the ovary.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opc\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
