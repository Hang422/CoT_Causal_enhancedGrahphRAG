Imipramine\nopb. Fluvoxamine\nopc. Phenelzine\nopd. Bupropion\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nImipramine is a tricyclic antidepressant known for its anticholinergic properties, which can reduce bladder contractions, making it effective for treating nocturnal enuresis. This aligns with clinical consensus that supports its use in this condition. In contrast, fluvoxamine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), is not typically indicated for nocturnal enuresis and is considered less effective. Phenelzine, a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI), is also not indicated for this condition, and bupropion, an atypical antidepressant, lacks evidence supporting its use for nocturnal enuresis. Therefore, the best-supported option for treating nocturnal enuresis is imipramine.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

Imipramine, a tricyclic antidepressant, is known for its anticholinergic properties, which help reduce bladder contractions and are effective in treating nocturnal enuresis. This aligns with the clinical consensus and standard medical knowledge. The other options, including fluvoxamine (an SSRI), phenelzine (an MAOI), and bupropion (an atypical antidepressant), are not typically used for this condition.
