Cinchonism\nopb. Hyperglycemia\nopc. Hypoglycemia\nopd. Hypokalemia\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nQuinine is known to cause cinchonism, which includes symptoms such as sweating and palpitations. The reasoning chains indicate that these symptoms are likely due to cinchonism, a recognized side effect of quinine. The evidence paths, while broad, confirm that quinine's effects can manifest in the cardiovascular system, supporting the conclusion that the symptoms observed in the patient are consistent with cinchonism. Therefore, the most likely cause of sweating and palpitation in this context is cinchonism.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Quinine is an antimalarial drug that can cause a range of side effects, one of which is cinchonism. Cinchonism is characterized by symptoms such as tinnitus, headache, nausea, dizziness, and in some cases, sweating and palpitations. These symptoms are due to the effects of quinine on the central nervous system and cardiovascular system. While hypoglycemia and hypokalemia can also cause palpitations and sweating, they are less commonly associated with quinine use compared to cinchonism. Hyperglycemia is not typically associated with these symptoms in the context of quinine administration. Given the symptoms of sweating and palpitations in a patient taking quinine, cinchonism is the most likely cause based on standard medical knowledge and the enhanced information provided.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}",
