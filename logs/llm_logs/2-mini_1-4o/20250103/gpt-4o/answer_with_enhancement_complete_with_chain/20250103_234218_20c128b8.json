It is highly effective in the treatment of aspergillosis\nopb. It does not penetrate the blood-brain barrier\nopc. Its oral bioavailability is less than that of ketoconazole\nopd. It inhibits demethylation of lanosterol\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nFluconazole is an antifungal medication primarily effective against Candida species, not Aspergillus, making it ineffective for treating aspergillosis. It is known to penetrate the blood-brain barrier, which allows it to treat fungal infections in the central nervous system. Fluconazole has high oral bioavailability, greater than that of ketoconazole. Additionally, it inhibits the enzyme lanosterol demethylase, which is involved in ergosterol synthesis, confirming its role in inhibiting demethylation of lanosterol.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

It is known to penetrate the blood-brain barrier, making it useful for treating central nervous system fungal infections. Fluconazole has high oral bioavailability, which is greater than that of ketoconazole. The mechanism of action of fluconazole involves the inhibition of the enzyme lanosterol demethylase, which is crucial in the synthesis of ergosterol, an essential component of fungal cell membranes.
