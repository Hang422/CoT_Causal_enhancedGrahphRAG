Patient gives history of recurrent bacterial infections. Ophthalmic examination reveals white triangular plaques on conjunctiva. This patient is suffering from deficiency of:\n\n                    ### Options\n                    opa. Vitamin D\nopb. Vitamin B\nopc. Vitamin A\nopd. Vitamin C\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nThe patient's symptoms of diminished vision during night (night blindness), dryness of eyes, and recurrent bacterial infections strongly indicate a deficiency in Vitamin A. Night blindness is a classic symptom of Vitamin A deficiency, which is essential for maintaining proper vision, particularly in low-light conditions. The dryness of the eyes suggests xerophthalmia, a condition often caused by Vitamin A deficiency. The presence of white triangular plaques on the conjunctiva, known as Bitot's spots, further supports this diagnosis. Additionally, Vitamin A plays a crucial role in immune function, and its deficiency can lead to increased susceptibility to infections. Therefore, the evidence aligns with a diagnosis of Vitamin A deficiency as the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The patient's symptoms of night blindness, dryness of eyes, and recurrent bacterial infections are indicative of a Vitamin A deficiency. Night blindness is a well-known symptom of Vitamin A deficiency, as this vitamin is crucial for the synthesis of rhodopsin, a pigment in the retina that is essential for vision in low-light conditions. The dryness of the eyes and the presence of white triangular plaques on the conjunctiva, known as Bitot's spots, are classic signs of xerophthalmia, which is directly linked to Vitamin A deficiency. Additionally, Vitamin A is important for maintaining the integrity of mucosal surfaces and immune function, explaining the recurrent bacterial infections. Therefore, the most likely correct option is Vitamin A deficiency.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opc\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
