Proximal tubule\nopb. Distal tubules\nopc. Loop of Henle\nopd. Collecting duct\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nAldosterone primarily acts on the distal tubules and collecting duct of the nephron. It increases sodium reabsorption and potassium excretion through the stimulation of sodium-potassium ATPase, which is most significant in these segments. This action is crucial for regulating electrolyte balance and influencing water retention. The retrieved evidence paths confirm that aldosterone's role is associated with renal tubule function and electrolyte management, supporting the consensus that its primary action occurs in the distal tubules and collecting duct.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Aldosterone is a hormone that plays a critical role in regulating sodium and potassium balance in the body. It primarily acts on the distal tubules and the collecting duct of the nephron. In these segments, aldosterone increases sodium reabsorption and potassium excretion by stimulating the sodium-potassium ATPase pump. This action is essential for maintaining electrolyte balance and blood pressure. The enhanced information aligns with the standard medical knowledge that aldosterone's primary action occurs in the distal tubules and collecting duct. Therefore, the most likely correct options are opb (Distal tubules) and opd (Collecting duct). Given the options provided, the best-supported answer is opb, as it is more commonly emphasized in medical literature.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
