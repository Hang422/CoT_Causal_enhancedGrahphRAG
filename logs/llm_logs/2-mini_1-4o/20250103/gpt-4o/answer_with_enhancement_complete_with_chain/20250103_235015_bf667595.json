Vasopressin\nopb. Terlipressin\nopc. Desmopressin\nopd. Pralipressin\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nNeurogenic diabetes insipidus is characterized by insufficient production of antidiuretic hormone (ADH), leading to excessive urination. The drug of choice for this condition is Desmopressin, a synthetic analog of vasopressin (ADH), which effectively mimics its action and reduces urine output. Desmopressin is preferred due to its efficacy and safety profile compared to other vasopressin analogs. While vasopressin itself can be used, Desmopressin is more effective in managing the symptoms of neurogenic diabetes insipidus. The evidence supports that Desmopressin is the most appropriate treatment option for this condition.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Neurogenic diabetes insipidus is a condition where there is a deficiency in the production of antidiuretic hormone (ADH), leading to excessive urination. The primary treatment goal is to replace the missing hormone to reduce urine output and manage symptoms. Desmopressin, a synthetic analog of vasopressin, is the drug of choice for this condition. It is preferred over vasopressin and other analogs due to its longer duration of action, better safety profile, and effectiveness in mimicking the action of natural ADH. The enhanced information aligns with standard medical knowledge, confirming that Desmopressin is the most appropriate treatment option for neurogenic diabetes insipidus.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opc\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
