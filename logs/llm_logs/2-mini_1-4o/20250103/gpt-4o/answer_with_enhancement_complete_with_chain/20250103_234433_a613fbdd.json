Adenylyl cyclase\nopc. Na+-K+-ATPase\nopd. Galactosyl transferase\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\n5'-nucleotidase, Adenylyl cyclase, and Na+-K+-ATPase are all recognized as enzymatic markers of the plasma membrane, as they are integral to its function and are located within or associated with the membrane. In contrast, Galactosyl transferase is primarily located in the Golgi apparatus and is not considered a plasma membrane enzyme. Therefore, Galactosyl transferase is the correct answer as the exception among the options provided.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The question asks for an exception among enzymatic markers of the plasma membrane. 5'-nucleotidase, Adenylyl cyclase, and Na+-K+-ATPase are well-established as enzymes associated with the plasma membrane. They play roles in nucleotide metabolism, signal transduction, and ion transport, respectively, and are integral to the membrane's function. Galactosyl transferase, on the other hand, is primarily associated with the Golgi apparatus, where it is involved in glycosylation processes. It is not typically considered a marker of the plasma membrane. Therefore, based on standard medical knowledge and the enhanced information provided, Galactosyl transferase is the enzyme that does not belong to the group of plasma membrane markers.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
