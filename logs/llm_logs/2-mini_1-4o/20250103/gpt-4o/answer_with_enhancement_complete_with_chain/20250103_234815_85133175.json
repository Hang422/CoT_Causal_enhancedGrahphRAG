Bromocriptine\nopb. Levodopa\nopc. Amantadine\nopd. Metoclopramide\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nHyperprolactinemia is primarily caused by dopamine antagonists, which increase prolactin secretion. Metoclopramide is a dopamine antagonist and is well-documented to cause hyperprolactinemia, aligning with the reasoning chain that states it increases prolactin secretion. In contrast, bromocriptine is a dopamine agonist that decreases prolactin levels, thus it does not cause hyperprolactinemia. Levodopa, a dopamine precursor, may decrease prolactin levels, and amantadine's effects on prolactin are unclear but generally do not lead to hyperprolactinemia. Therefore, the only option that directly causes hyperprolactinemia is metoclopramide.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Hyperprolactinemia is a condition characterized by elevated levels of prolactin in the blood. It is commonly caused by medications that act as dopamine antagonists, as dopamine normally inhibits prolactin secretion. Metoclopramide is a well-known dopamine antagonist and is documented to cause hyperprolactinemia by blocking dopamine receptors, leading to increased prolactin levels. In contrast, bromocriptine is a dopamine agonist and is used to treat hyperprolactinemia by decreasing prolactin levels. Levodopa, a precursor to dopamine, can also decrease prolactin levels. Amantadine's effects on prolactin are not well-documented, but it is not typically associated with causing hyperprolactinemia. Therefore, based on standard medical knowledge and the enhanced information provided, metoclopramide is the most likely medication to cause hyperprolactinemia.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
