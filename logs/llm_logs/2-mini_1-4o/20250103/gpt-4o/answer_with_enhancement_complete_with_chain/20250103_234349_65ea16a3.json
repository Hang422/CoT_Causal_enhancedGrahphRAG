Vitamin A\nopb. Vitamin B\nopc. Vitamin C\nopd. Vitamin E\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nNyctalopia, or night blindness, is primarily caused by a deficiency of Vitamin A. This vitamin is essential for the production of rhodopsin, a visual pigment necessary for low-light vision. The reasoning chains consistently highlight the link between Vitamin A deficiency and impaired retinal function, confirming that Vitamin A is crucial for the regeneration of visual pigments. Evidence paths support this by indicating that Vitamin A deficiency is associated with rhodopsin and retinal health. Therefore, the correct answer is Vitamin A.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Nyctalopia, commonly known as night blindness, is primarily caused by a deficiency in Vitamin A. This vitamin is crucial for the synthesis of rhodopsin, a photopigment found in the rod cells of the retina, which is essential for vision in low-light conditions. A deficiency in Vitamin A leads to impaired production of rhodopsin, resulting in difficulty seeing in dim light. The enhanced information aligns with standard medical knowledge, confirming that Vitamin A deficiency is the primary cause of nyctalopia. Other vitamins listed, such as Vitamin B, C, and E, do not have a direct role in the production of rhodopsin or in night vision, making them unlikely causes of nyctalopia.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
