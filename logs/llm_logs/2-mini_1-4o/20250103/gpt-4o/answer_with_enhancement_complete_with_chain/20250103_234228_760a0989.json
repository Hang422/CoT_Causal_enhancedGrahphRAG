Aldosterone\nopb. DOCA\nopc. Fludrocoeisone\nopd. Triamcinolone\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nAldosterone is recognized as the most potent mineralocorticoid, primarily regulating sodium and potassium balance in the body. While DOCA (Deoxycorticosterone Acetate) is also a mineralocorticoid, it is less potent than aldosterone. Fludrocortisone is a synthetic mineralocorticoid that is more potent than cortisol but still not as potent as aldosterone. Triamcinolone, on the other hand, is a glucocorticoid and does not possess mineralocorticoid activity. Therefore, the consensus supports that aldosterone is the most potent mineralocorticoid.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The question asks for the most potent mineralocorticoid. Mineralocorticoids are a class of corticosteroids that influence salt and water balances. Aldosterone is the primary and most potent natural mineralocorticoid in the human body, responsible for regulating sodium and potassium levels. DOCA (Deoxycorticosterone Acetate) is a mineralocorticoid but is less potent than aldosterone. Fludrocortisone is a synthetic mineralocorticoid with potent activity, often used therapeutically for its mineralocorticoid effects, but it is not as potent as aldosterone in physiological terms. Triamcinolone is a glucocorticoid and does not have significant mineralocorticoid activity. Based on standard medical knowledge and the enhanced information provided, aldosterone is the most potent mineralocorticoid.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
