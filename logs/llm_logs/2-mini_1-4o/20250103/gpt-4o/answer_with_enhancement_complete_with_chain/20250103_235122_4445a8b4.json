Quinine\nopb. Chloroquine\nopc. Mefloquine\nopd. Atovaquone\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nChloroquine is well-documented to cause retinal toxicity, leading to retinal pigmentation changes, making it the most relevant option for retinal pigmentation among the choices. Quinine has possible retinal effects, but its impact on pigmentation is unclear and less established. Mefloquine is primarily associated with neuropsychiatric side effects and has no established link to retinal pigmentation. Atovaquone is known for its antimalarial action but has no known retinal toxicity. Therefore, the most consensus-supported cause of retinal pigmentation is Chloroquine.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Chloroquine is well-documented to cause retinal toxicity, specifically a condition known as bull's eye maculopathy, which involves retinal pigmentation changes. This is a recognized side effect of long-term use of chloroquine, particularly in the treatment of conditions like rheumatoid arthritis and lupus. Quinine, while it can have some retinal effects, is not primarily associated with pigmentation changes. Mefloquine is known for its neuropsychiatric side effects rather than retinal effects. Atovaquone does not have known retinal toxicity. Therefore, based on standard medical knowledge and consensus, chloroquine is the most likely cause of retinal pigmentation among the options provided.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
