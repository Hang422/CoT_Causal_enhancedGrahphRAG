Fibrinolysis\nopb. Activation of collagenase\nopc. Destruction of VWF\nopd. Stabilization of fibrin\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nPlasmin is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in fibrinolysis, the process of breaking down fibrin in blood clots. It is involved in the degradation of fibrin, which promotes fibrinolysis. Plasmin does not activate collagenase, which is a separate enzyme involved in collagen breakdown. Additionally, while plasmin can interact with von Willebrand factor (VWF), its role in the destruction of VWF is not clearly defined and is not a primary function. Importantly, plasmin does not stabilize fibrin; rather, it acts to break it down. Therefore, the correct answer to the question regarding the functions of plasmin is that it does not stabilize fibrin.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Plasmin is primarily known for its role in fibrinolysis, where it breaks down fibrin in blood clots. It does not activate collagenase, as this is a function of a different enzyme. While plasmin can interact with von Willebrand factor (VWF), its role in the destruction of VWF is not a primary or well-defined function. Importantly, plasmin does not stabilize fibrin; it degrades it. Therefore, the function that plasmin does not perform is the stabilization of fibrin, as its role is to break down fibrin rather than stabilize it.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
