Retro bulbar neuritis\nopb. Deafness\nopc. Red urine\nopd. Peripheral neuritis\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nEthambutol is primarily known for its potential side effects, particularly retrobulbar neuritis, which can lead to visual disturbances. This aligns with the consensus that retrobulbar neuritis is a recognized adverse effect of ethambutol, supported by the reasoning chains indicating its association with visual disturbances. Peripheral neuritis is also a possible side effect, though less commonly reported. However, ethambutol is not typically associated with deafness, contradicting the evidence paths suggesting a link to hearing loss. While ethambutol can cause urine color changes, red urine is not a common or well-documented side effect. Therefore, the most accurate and consensus-supported conclusion is that ethambutol causes retrobulbar neuritis.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Ethambutol is an antitubercular medication known for its potential to cause visual side effects, particularly retrobulbar neuritis. This condition affects the optic nerve and can lead to visual disturbances, such as decreased visual acuity and color vision changes. This side effect is well-documented and widely recognized in medical literature. While peripheral neuritis is a possible side effect, it is less commonly associated with ethambutol compared to retrobulbar neuritis. Ethambutol is not typically linked to deafness or red urine, making these options less likely. Therefore, based on standard medical knowledge and consensus, retrobulbar neuritis is the most likely side effect caused by ethambutol.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
