Tamsulosin\nopb. Prazosin\nopc. Oxazocin\nopd. Dolazoline\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nAlpha-1 adrenergic blockers are effective in providing symptomatic relief in benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) by relaxing smooth muscle in the prostate and urethra, thereby reducing urinary obstruction. Tamsulosin is a selective alpha-1A blocker that specifically decreases resistance in the prostatic urethra, leading to improved urinary flow and is well-supported in clinical use for BPH. Prazosin, while an alpha-1 blocker, is less selective and primarily used for hypertension, which may limit its efficacy for urinary symptoms in BPH. Oxazocin is also an alpha-1 blocker but is less commonly used and has unclear efficacy in BPH. Dolazoline, an alpha-2 adrenergic agonist, is not primarily indicated for BPH and is unlikely to provide symptomatic relief. Therefore, Tamsulosin is the most appropriate choice for symptomatic relief in BPH.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Alpha-1 adrenergic blockers are used to provide symptomatic relief in benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) by relaxing the smooth muscle in the prostate and bladder neck, which reduces urinary obstruction. Among the options provided, Tamsulosin is a selective alpha-1A adrenergic blocker that is specifically designed to target the receptors in the prostate, making it highly effective for BPH. It is widely used and well-supported in clinical practice for this indication. Prazosin, while an alpha-1 blocker, is less selective and primarily used for hypertension, which makes it less ideal for BPH. Oxazocin is not commonly used and lacks clear evidence for BPH treatment. Dolazoline is not an alpha-1 blocker and is not indicated for BPH. Therefore, based on standard medical knowledge and consensus, Tamsulosin is the most appropriate choice for symptomatic relief in BPH.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
