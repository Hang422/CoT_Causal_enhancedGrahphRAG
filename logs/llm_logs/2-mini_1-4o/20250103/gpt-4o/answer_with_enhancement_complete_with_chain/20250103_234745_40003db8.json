Heparin sulfate\nopb. Protamine sulfate\nopc. Low molecular weight heparin\nopd. Warfarin\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nCancer surgery significantly increases the risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE), and prophylaxis is essential to prevent thromboembolic events. Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) is the anticoagulant of choice for VTE prophylaxis in patients undergoing cancer surgery, as supported by clinical guidelines. Heparin sulfate, while an anticoagulant, is not preferred for prophylaxis due to its short duration of action and requirement for monitoring. Warfarin, although effective, has a delayed onset and requires monitoring, making it unsuitable for immediate post-surgical prophylaxis. Protamine sulfate is an antidote for heparin and does not possess anticoagulant properties, thus is not applicable for prophylaxis. Therefore, the consensus strongly supports the use of low molecular weight heparin for this indication.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"In the context of prophylaxis for venous thromboembolism (VTE) in patients undergoing cancer surgery, the primary goal is to prevent thromboembolic events effectively and safely. Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) is widely recognized as the anticoagulant of choice in this scenario. This is due to its favorable pharmacokinetic profile, which includes a predictable anticoagulant response, longer half-life, and reduced need for monitoring compared to unfractionated heparin. LMWH is also preferred over warfarin because warfarin has a delayed onset of action and requires regular monitoring of INR levels, which is not ideal in the immediate postoperative setting. Protamine sulfate is not an anticoagulant but rather an antidote for heparin, and heparin sulfate is not typically used for VTE prophylaxis due to its short duration of action and need for frequent monitoring. Therefore, based on clinical guidelines and consensus, low molecular weight heparin is the most appropriate choice for VTE prophylaxis in patients undergoing cancer surgery.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opc\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
