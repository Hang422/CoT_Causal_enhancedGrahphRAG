Streptomycin\nopb. Ethambutol\nopc. Capreomycin\nopd. Rifampicin\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nIn evaluating the antitubercular drugs for use in severe renal failure, the following consensus-aligned reasoning applies: \n\n1. **Streptomycin**: This drug is primarily excreted by the kidneys, leading to potential accumulation and increased risk of toxicity in patients with severe renal failure. Therefore, it is not recommended for use in this population. \n\n2. **Ethambutol**: Ethambutol is partially renally excreted, and while dose adjustments are necessary in renal failure, it can be used with caution. This aligns with the consensus that careful monitoring and adjustment can mitigate risks. \n\n3. **Capreomycin**: Similar to streptomycin, capreomycin is also excreted by the kidneys and poses a risk of nephrotoxicity in patients with renal impairment. It is generally not recommended in severe renal failure. \n\n4. **Rifampicin**: Rifampicin is primarily metabolized by the liver with minimal renal excretion, making it generally safe for use in patients with renal failure. This aligns with the consensus that it can be used without significant risk in this context. \n\nIn summary, Ethambutol can be used with caution with dose adjustments, and Rifampicin is considered safe in severe renal failure, while Streptomycin and Capreomycin are not recommended due to the risk of toxicity.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

Streptomycin and Capreomycin are both primarily excreted by the kidneys, making them unsuitable for patients with severe renal failure due to the risk of nephrotoxicity. Ethambutol, while partially excreted by the kidneys, can be used with caution and requires dose adjustments and careful monitoring. Rifampicin, on the other hand, is primarily metabolized by the liver and has minimal renal excretion, making it the safest option for use in patients with severe renal failure. Based on this analysis, Rifampicin is the most appropriate choice for use in severe renal failure.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
