Flutamide\nopb. Finasteride\nopc. Prazosin\nopd. Minoxidil\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nFinasteride is a 5α reductase inhibitor that effectively reduces dihydrotestosterone (DHT) levels, which is beneficial in treating both benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH) and male pattern baldness (androgenetic alopecia). The reasoning chains confirm that Finasteride improves urinary symptoms in BPH and promotes hair regrowth in male pattern baldness, aligning with established medical consensus. Other options, such as Flutamide, Prazosin, and Minoxidil, do not have this dual indication. Evidence paths further support Finasteride's role in treating androgenetic alopecia and BPH, confirming its effectiveness in both conditions.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The question asks for a 5α reductase inhibitor effective in both benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH) and male pattern baldness. Finasteride is well-documented in medical literature as a 5α reductase inhibitor that reduces dihydrotestosterone (DHT) levels, which is beneficial for both conditions. It is commonly used to treat BPH by improving urinary symptoms and is also approved for treating male pattern baldness by promoting hair regrowth. The other options do not fit the criteria: Flutamide is an antiandrogen, Prazosin is an alpha-blocker, and Minoxidil is a vasodilator used topically for hair growth but not a 5α reductase inhibitor. Therefore, based on standard medical knowledge and enhanced information, Finasteride is the most likely correct answer.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
