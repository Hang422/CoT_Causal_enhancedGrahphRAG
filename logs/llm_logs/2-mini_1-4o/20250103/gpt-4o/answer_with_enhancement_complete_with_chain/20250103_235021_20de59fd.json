Vitamin A\nopb. Vitamin K\nopc. Vitamin E\nopd. Vitamin D\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nVitamin K is the only fat-soluble vitamin identified to function as a coenzyme, specifically in the carboxylation of certain proteins required for blood clotting. Vitamin A is primarily involved in vision and immune function but does not act as a coenzyme. Vitamin E serves mainly as an antioxidant and is not known to function as a coenzyme. Vitamin D regulates calcium and phosphate metabolism but also does not function as a coenzyme. Therefore, the correct answer is Vitamin K.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The question asks which fat-soluble vitamin functions as a coenzyme. Among the options, Vitamin K is well-documented to act as a coenzyme. It plays a crucial role in the carboxylation of glutamic acid residues on proteins required for blood clotting, such as prothrombin. This function is unique among the fat-soluble vitamins. Vitamin A is involved in vision and immune function, Vitamin E acts as an antioxidant, and Vitamin D is involved in calcium and phosphate metabolism, none of which involve coenzyme activity. Therefore, based on standard medical knowledge and consensus, Vitamin K is the correct answer.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
