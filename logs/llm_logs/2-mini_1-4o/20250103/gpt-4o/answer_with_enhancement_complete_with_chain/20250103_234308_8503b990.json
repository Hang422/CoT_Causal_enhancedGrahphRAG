Can be used in absence seizures\nopb. Can be mixed with saline\nopc. Can be given orally\nopd. It is the drug of choice for myoclonic seizures\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nFosphenytoin is a prodrug of phenytoin, converted to phenytoin in the body, and shares similar efficacy in treating seizures. However, it is not typically used for absence seizures, which are better treated with other agents like ethosuximide. Fosphenytoin is soluble in saline, making it easier to administer intravenously, which is a significant advantage over phenytoin. Both fosphenytoin and phenytoin can be given orally, but fosphenytoin is often preferred for IV use due to its solubility. Importantly, neither fosphenytoin nor phenytoin is the drug of choice for myoclonic seizures, as other medications like valproate are preferred. Therefore, the correct distinction is that fosphenytoin can be mixed with saline, which is not true for phenytoin.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Fosphenytoin is a prodrug of phenytoin and is primarily used for its improved solubility and ease of administration compared to phenytoin. It can be mixed with saline, which is a significant advantage over phenytoin, as phenytoin is not soluble in saline and requires a special diluent for intravenous administration. This makes option 'opb' the most accurate distinction between fosphenytoin and phenytoin. Fosphenytoin is not used for absence seizures, cannot be given orally, and is not the drug of choice for myoclonic seizures, aligning with standard medical knowledge.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
