Clindamycin\nopb. Cefepime\nopc. Metronidazole\nopd. Azithromycin\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nThe drug of choice for gonococcal urethritis is ceftriaxone, which is a first-line cephalosporin antibiotic. For non-gonococcal urethritis, azithromycin is commonly recommended due to its effectiveness against Chlamydia. While cefepime is also a cephalosporin, it is not first-line for urethritis. Therefore, azithromycin is the preferred choice for non-gonococcal urethritis, but it is not the drug of choice for gonococcal urethritis. The consensus indicates that ceftriaxone is the standard treatment for gonococcal urethritis, while azithromycin is effective for non-gonococcal cases.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The treatment of urethritis depends on whether it is gonococcal or non-gonococcal. For gonococcal urethritis, the standard treatment is ceftriaxone, a cephalosporin antibiotic. For non-gonococcal urethritis, which is often caused by Chlamydia trachomatis, azithromycin is commonly used due to its effectiveness. While the enhanced information correctly identifies ceftriaxone as the drug of choice for gonococcal urethritis, it is not listed among the options. Azithromycin, however, is effective for non-gonococcal urethritis and is also used in combination with ceftriaxone for gonococcal infections to cover potential co-infection with Chlamydia. Therefore, azithromycin is the best choice among the given options for treating both gonococcal and non-gonococcal urethritis.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
