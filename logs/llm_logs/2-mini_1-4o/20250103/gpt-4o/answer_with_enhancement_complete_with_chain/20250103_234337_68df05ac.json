Outer hair cells in basal area\nopb. Inner hair cells in basal area\nopc. Outer hair cells in apical area\nopd. Inner hair cells in apical area\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nAminoglycosides are known to be ototoxic and primarily affect the outer hair cells in the cochlea, particularly in the basal area. This is due to their mechanism of disrupting protein synthesis, leading to cell death, with outer hair cells being more vulnerable to damage. The majority of the damage occurs in the basal area of the cochlea, which is consistent with the consensus that aminoglycosides are associated with hearing loss through their impact on these specific hair cells. Evidence supports that aminoglycosides interact with genes and calcium channels in outer hair cells, further confirming their targeted effect in this region.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Aminoglycosides are a class of antibiotics known for their ototoxic effects, primarily affecting the cochlea in the inner ear. The cochlea is responsible for converting sound waves into nerve signals, and it contains both outer and inner hair cells. Aminoglycosides are particularly known to damage the outer hair cells, which are crucial for amplifying sound and enhancing frequency selectivity. The basal area of the cochlea is responsible for high-frequency sound detection and is more susceptible to damage from aminoglycosides due to its higher metabolic activity and exposure to these drugs. This aligns with the consensus that aminoglycosides primarily affect the outer hair cells in the basal area of the cochlea, leading to high-frequency hearing loss. Therefore, the most likely correct option is that aminoglycosides affect the outer hair cells in the basal area.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
