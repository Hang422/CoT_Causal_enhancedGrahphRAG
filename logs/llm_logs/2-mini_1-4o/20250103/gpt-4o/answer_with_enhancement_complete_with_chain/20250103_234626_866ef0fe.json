It is more common with huminsulin\nopb. It may occur in the presence of infections\nopc. It may be due to antibodies to insulin\nopd. Use of glucocorticoids may be useful in severe cases\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nInsulin resistance is a key feature of type 2 diabetes and is often associated with various factors. The statement regarding human insulin being more common in insulin resistance is misleading; while insulin resistance can occur in patients treated with human insulin, it is not inherently more common with this form of insulin compared to others. Insulin resistance can indeed occur during infections, which is a true statement. The idea that insulin resistance may be due to antibodies to insulin is possible but not a common cause, thus making this statement less reliable. Finally, the use of glucocorticoids is known to worsen insulin resistance rather than being useful in severe cases, contradicting the claim. Therefore, the correct answer is that the use of glucocorticoids may be useful in severe cases, as this is not true based on consensus.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Insulin resistance is a condition where the body's cells become less responsive to insulin, leading to higher blood sugar levels. It is a hallmark of type 2 diabetes and can be influenced by various factors. The statement that insulin resistance is more common with human insulin (opa) is misleading, as insulin resistance is not inherently more common with human insulin compared to other types. Infections can exacerbate insulin resistance (opb), which is a true statement. Antibodies to insulin can cause insulin resistance (opc), although this is not a common cause, it is still possible. The use of glucocorticoids (opd) is known to worsen insulin resistance, not improve it, making this statement incorrect. Therefore, the statement that glucocorticoids may be useful in severe cases is false, as they typically exacerbate insulin resistance.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
