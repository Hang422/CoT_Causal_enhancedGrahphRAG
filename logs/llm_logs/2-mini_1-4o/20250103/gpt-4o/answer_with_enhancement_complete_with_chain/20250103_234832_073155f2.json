Platelet dysfunction\nopb. Aspirin inhibits the action of heparin\nopc. Enhanced hypersensitivity of heparin\nopd. Therapy of heparin cannot be monitored\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nAspirin is an antiplatelet agent that inhibits platelet aggregation, leading to increased bleeding risk. This is particularly concerning in patients already on heparin, an anticoagulant, as the combination can significantly heighten the risk of hemorrhage. The reasoning chains correctly highlight that aspirin causes platelet dysfunction, which complicates heparin therapy due to the potential for increased bleeding. The evidence paths support the interaction between aspirin and heparin, emphasizing the risk of hemorrhage associated with aspirin use. Therefore, the primary reason aspirin is not given to patients on heparin is due to its potential to cause platelet dysfunction and increase bleeding risk, rather than any direct inhibition of heparin's action or monitoring issues.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Aspirin is known to cause platelet dysfunction by irreversibly inhibiting the enzyme cyclooxygenase, which is crucial for the synthesis of thromboxane A2, a promoter of platelet aggregation. This antiplatelet effect increases the risk of bleeding, especially when combined with heparin, an anticoagulant that prevents clot formation by inhibiting thrombin and factor Xa. The combination of these two drugs can significantly heighten the risk of hemorrhage due to their synergistic effects on the coagulation pathway. Therefore, the primary reason aspirin is not given to patients on heparin is due to its potential to cause platelet dysfunction, leading to increased bleeding risk. This aligns with standard medical knowledge and consensus, making 'platelet dysfunction' the most likely correct answer.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
