Interleukin-6\nopb. Interleukin-6 receptor\nopc. Interleukin-5\nopd. Interleukin-5 receptor\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nTocilizumab is a monoclonal antibody that primarily targets the Interleukin-6 receptor (IL-6R). It is used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, a condition characterized by inflammation where Interleukin-6 plays a significant role. The reasoning chains indicate that Tocilizumab inhibits the action of Interleukin-6 by binding to its receptor, which is crucial for its signaling in inflammatory processes. Evidence paths confirm that Tocilizumab interacts with the Interleukin-6 receptor and is effective in treating autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis. Therefore, the correct answer is that Tocilizumab is a monoclonal antibody against the Interleukin-6 receptor.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Tocilizumab is a monoclonal antibody used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. It specifically targets the Interleukin-6 receptor (IL-6R), not Interleukin-6 itself. This distinction is important because the drug works by inhibiting the action of Interleukin-6 by binding to its receptor, thereby blocking the signaling pathway that contributes to inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis. The enhanced information aligns with the standard medical consensus that Tocilizumab is an IL-6 receptor antagonist. Therefore, the most likely correct option is that Tocilizumab is a monoclonal antibody against the Interleukin-6 receptor.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
