Monotherapy for acute episodes\nopb. Monitoring of serum concentration is not useful for guiding dose adjustment\nopc. Can result in leucocytosis\nopd. Can result in hypehyroidism on long term use\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nLithium is not typically used as monotherapy for acute manic episodes; it is often combined with other medications for better efficacy. Monitoring of serum concentration is crucial for guiding dose adjustment, as lithium has a narrow therapeutic index. Lithium can cause leucocytosis, which is an increase in white blood cell count, aligning with the evidence path indicating its effect on bone marrow. Long-term use of lithium is more commonly associated with hypothyroidism rather than hyperthyroidism, as it can lead to thyroid dysfunction. Therefore, the true statement is that lithium can result in leucocytosis.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

It is not typically used as monotherapy for acute manic episodes (opa), as it is often combined with other medications for better efficacy. Monitoring of serum concentration is crucial for guiding dose adjustment (opb), due to lithium's narrow therapeutic index. Lithium can indeed cause leucocytosis (opc), which is an increase in white blood cell count, and this is a known effect. Long-term use of lithium is more commonly associated with hypothyroidism rather than hyperthyroidism (opd), as it can lead to thyroid dysfunction.
