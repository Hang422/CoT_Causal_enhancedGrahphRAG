Glucocoicoids\nopb. Mineralcoicoids\nopc. Aldosterone\nopd. Androgens\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nThe zona reticularis of the adrenal cortex primarily secretes androgens, which is supported by standard physiological consensus. The reasoning chain correctly identifies androgens as the major hormone secreted by this layer, aligning with the evidence path that shows the zona reticularis is a location of androgens. While the zona reticularis may produce some glucocorticoids, they are not the primary hormones secreted, and mineralocorticoids and aldosterone are primarily associated with other zones of the adrenal cortex (zona glomerulosa for aldosterone). The evidence paths confirm the production of androgens in the zona reticularis, supporting the conclusion that androgens are the major hormones secreted by this zone.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The adrenal cortex is divided into three zones: zona glomerulosa, zona fasciculata, and zona reticularis. Each zone is responsible for producing different types of hormones. The zona reticularis primarily secretes androgens, which are a group of hormones that play a role in male traits and reproductive activity. While the zona reticularis can produce some glucocorticoids, they are not the primary hormones secreted by this zone. Mineralocorticoids, including aldosterone, are primarily produced by the zona glomerulosa. Therefore, based on standard physiological knowledge and consensus, the major hormone secreted by the zona reticularis is androgens.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
