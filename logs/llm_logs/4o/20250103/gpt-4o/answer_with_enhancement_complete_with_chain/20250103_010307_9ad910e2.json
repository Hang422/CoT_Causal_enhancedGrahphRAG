Directly simulated by fall in PaO2\nopb. Connected with cardiac center\nopc. Inhibited during swallowing\nopd. Situated in midbrain\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nThe respiratory center is located in the brainstem, specifically in the medulla oblongata and pons, and is not situated in the midbrain. It is connected with the cardiac center through autonomic pathways, reflecting the integration of respiratory and cardiovascular functions. The respiratory center is not directly stimulated by a fall in PaO2; instead, it is primarily responsive to changes in PaCO2 and pH levels. During swallowing, the respiratory center is temporarily inhibited to prevent aspiration. The retrieved evidence path regarding the brainstem's location does not directly address the respiratory center's function or connections, so it is not directly relevant to the question.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The respiratory center is located in the brainstem, specifically in the medulla oblongata and pons, not in the midbrain, which rules out option opd. It is primarily responsive to changes in PaCO2 and pH, rather than directly to a fall in PaO2, eliminating option opa. The respiratory center is connected with the cardiac center through autonomic pathways, reflecting the integration of respiratory and cardiovascular functions, supporting option opb. During swallowing, the respiratory center is temporarily inhibited to prevent aspiration, which supports option opc. Both options opb and opc are correct, but since the question asks for what is 'true regarding the respiratory center,' and considering the context of the question, option opc is more directly related to the function of the respiratory center itself.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opc\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}",
