They are called as \"high ceiling\" diuretics\nopb. They act on Na+.K+.2Cl- symporter\nopc. They can cause hyperuricemia\nopd. Loop diuretics lead to hypercalcemia and hypomagnesimia\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nLoop diuretics are known as 'high ceiling' diuretics due to their potent diuretic effect, which aligns with the consensus that they significantly increase urine output (Option A is true). They act on the Na+.K+.2Cl- symporter in the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle, inhibiting the reabsorption of sodium, potassium, and chloride ions, which is a well-established mechanism (Option B is true). Loop diuretics can cause hyperuricemia by increasing uric acid reabsorption, which is a recognized side effect (Option C is true). However, loop diuretics increase the excretion of calcium, leading to hypocalcemia, not hypercalcemia. They also increase magnesium excretion, leading to hypomagnesemia. Therefore, the statement that loop diuretics lead to hypercalcemia is incorrect (Option D is false). The retrieved evidence paths support the understanding that loop diuretics are associated with increased calcium excretion, which can lead to hypocalcemia, contradicting the claim of hypercalcemia.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "
