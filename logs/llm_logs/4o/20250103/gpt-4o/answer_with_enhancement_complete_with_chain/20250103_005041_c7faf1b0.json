Methotrexate\nopb. Doxorubicin\nopc. Cisplatin\nopd. Busulfan\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nPulmonary fibrosis is a known complication of certain medications, particularly those with lung toxicity. Methotrexate, an immunosuppressive therapy, is associated with potential lung toxicity and can lead to pulmonary fibrosis, though this is less common. Doxorubicin, primarily known for cardiotoxicity, has less common associations with lung toxicity and pulmonary fibrosis. Cisplatin is mainly associated with nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity, with pulmonary fibrosis being a rare complication. Busulfan, an alkylating agent, is well-documented to cause lung toxicity and is strongly associated with pulmonary fibrosis. The evidence paths confirm that alkylating agents, like Busulfan, are linked to lung processes, supporting the consensus that Busulfan is most strongly associated with pulmonary fibrosis among the options.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "
