Fatty acids\nopb. Ketone bodies\nopc. Glucose\nopd. Any of the above\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nIn normal conditions, the primary source of energy for cardiac muscle is fatty acids. This is due to the process of beta-oxidation, which efficiently produces ATP, making fatty acids the predominant energy source, accounting for approximately 60-70% of the heart's energy needs. Ketone bodies and glucose can also be used for ATP production, but they serve as secondary and lesser energy sources, respectively. Ketone bodies are more utilized during fasting or diabetic states, while glucose is more significant during high-intensity activities or ischemic conditions. The retrieved evidence path broadly associates oxidation with ATP production, which supports the role of fatty acids and ketone bodies in energy metabolism but does not specifically address the primary energy source in normal conditions. Therefore, the consensus is that fatty acids are the main energy source for cardiac muscle under normal physiological conditions.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "
