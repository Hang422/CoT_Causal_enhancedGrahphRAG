Lipase\nopb. Pepsinogens\nopc. HCI\nopd. None\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nThe stomach secretes pepsinogens and hydrochloric acid (HCl), which are essential for protein digestion and creating an acidic environment, respectively. Gastric lipase is also secreted by the stomach, contributing to lipid digestion, although it is not the primary source of lipase in the body, as the pancreas secretes the majority of lipase. Therefore, while lipase is secreted by the stomach, it is not its main secretion. The retrieved evidence paths confirm the secretion of pepsinogens by the stomach but do not provide additional relevant information for the other options. Thus, the correct answer is that lipase, while secreted by the stomach, is not primarily secreted by it, making it the least characteristic secretion of the stomach among the options.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The stomach is known to secrete several substances, including pepsinogens and hydrochloric acid (HCl), which are crucial for digestion. Pepsinogens are precursors to pepsin, an enzyme that digests proteins, and HCl creates an acidic environment necessary for pepsin activity. Gastric lipase is also secreted by the stomach and plays a role in lipid digestion, although it is not the primary source of lipase in the body, as the pancreas is the main producer of lipase. Given the options, all substances listed are secreted by the stomach, but lipase is the least characteristic secretion because it is not the primary source of lipase in the body. Therefore, the best-supported option is that lipase, while secreted by the stomach, is not primarily secreted by it, making it the least characteristic secretion of the stomach among the options.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}\n```",
