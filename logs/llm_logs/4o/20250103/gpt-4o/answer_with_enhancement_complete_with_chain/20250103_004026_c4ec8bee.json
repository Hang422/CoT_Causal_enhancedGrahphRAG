Ca transporter\nopb. Cu transporter\nopc. Zn transporter\nopd. Se transporter\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nMenke's Kinky hair syndrome is a genetic disorder caused by a defect in copper metabolism, specifically due to a mutation in the ATP7A gene, which encodes a copper-transporting ATPase. This defect leads to impaired copper transport and results in copper deficiency (hypocupremia), which manifests as neurological symptoms, connective tissue disorders, and characteristic kinky hair. The reasoning chains correctly identify the defect in the Cu transporter as the cause of Menke's Kinky hair syndrome. The retrieved evidence paths support this by linking Menke's syndrome to symptoms like neurological issues and connective tissue diseases, both associated with copper deficiency. Therefore, the correct answer is that Menke's Kinky hair syndrome is due to a defect in the Cu transporter.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "
