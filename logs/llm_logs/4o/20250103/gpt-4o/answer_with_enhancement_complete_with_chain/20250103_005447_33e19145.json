HGPRTase\nopb. Adenosine deaminase\nopc. APRTase\nopd. Acid maltase\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nIn evaluating the potential enzyme deficiencies in the child, we consider the following: HGPRTase deficiency is associated with the accumulation of uric acid, leading to gout-like symptoms and neurological issues, which aligns with known symptoms of Lesch-Nyhan syndrome. Adenosine deaminase deficiency results in the accumulation of toxic metabolites causing severe combined immunodeficiency, characterized by recurrent infections. APRTase deficiency leads to the accumulation of adenine and the formation of 2,8-dihydroxyadenine stones, resulting in kidney stones. Acid maltase deficiency, also known as Pompe disease, causes glycogen accumulation in lysosomes, leading to muscle weakness and cardiomyopathy. The retrieved evidence paths, while broad, support the link between glycogen accumulation and cardiomyopathy, relevant to acid maltase deficiency. Therefore, if the child presents with muscle weakness and cardiomyopathy, acid maltase deficiency is the most likely enzyme deficiency.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

Acid maltase deficiency, or Pompe disease, is associated with glycogen accumulation in lysosomes, causing muscle weakness and cardiomyopathy.
