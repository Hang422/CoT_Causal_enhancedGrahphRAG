Propanolol\nopb. Oral contraceptives\nopc. Reserpine\nopd. Flupenthixol\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nPropranolol, a beta-blocker, is known to have central nervous system effects, including the potential to cause depression, aligning with the consensus that beta-blockers can affect mood. Oral contraceptives can lead to hormonal changes that may result in mood alterations, including depression, which is consistent with known side effects. Reserpine depletes monoamines such as serotonin, which is strongly associated with causing depression, supporting the consensus. Flupenthixol, an antipsychotic, acts as a dopamine receptor antagonist and is generally used to improve mood in depressive disorders, and is not typically associated with causing depression. Therefore, Flupenthixol is the option least associated with depression as a side effect.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"To determine which medication is not associated with depression as a side effect, we evaluate each option based on known pharmacological effects. Propranolol, a beta-blocker, is known to potentially cause depression due to its central nervous system effects. Oral contraceptives can alter mood due to hormonal changes, which may include depression. Reserpine depletes monoamines like serotonin, which is directly linked to causing depression. Flupenthixol, on the other hand, is an antipsychotic that is often used to treat depressive symptoms and is not typically associated with causing depression. Therefore, based on standard medical knowledge and consensus, Flupenthixol is the least likely to cause depression as a side effect.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}\n```",
