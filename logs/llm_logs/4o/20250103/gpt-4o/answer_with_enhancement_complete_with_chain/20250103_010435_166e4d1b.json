Discoid lupus erythematous\nopb. Rheumatoid ahritis\nopc. Infectious mononucleosis\nopd. All of the above\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nChloroquine is well-established for its use in treating discoid lupus erythematosus due to its anti-inflammatory effects, which aligns with the consensus and is supported by evidence that chloroquine treats lupus erythematosus, discoid. While chloroquine has immunomodulatory effects that could potentially benefit rheumatoid arthritis, it is not a standard treatment for this condition, and the evidence does not strongly support its use here. Chloroquine's antiviral properties are not effective against infectious mononucleosis, which is primarily caused by the Epstein-Barr virus, and there is no consensus or evidence supporting its use for this condition. Therefore, chloroquine is primarily useful in discoid lupus erythematosus.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Chloroquine is primarily used for its anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties. It is well-established in the treatment of discoid lupus erythematosus, where it helps manage symptoms and reduce flare-ups. While chloroquine has some immunomodulatory effects that could theoretically benefit rheumatoid arthritis, it is not a standard or widely accepted treatment for this condition, as more effective and targeted therapies are available. Regarding infectious mononucleosis, chloroquine does not have a role, as this condition is caused by the Epstein-Barr virus, and chloroquine's antiviral properties are not effective against it. Therefore, based on the consensus and available evidence, chloroquine is primarily useful in treating discoid lupus erythematosus.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
