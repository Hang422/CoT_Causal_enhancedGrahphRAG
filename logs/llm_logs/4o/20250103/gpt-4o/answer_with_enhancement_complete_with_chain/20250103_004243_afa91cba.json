Collecting duct\nopb. Glomerulus\nopc. Proximal convoluted tubule\nopd. Loop of Henle\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nAldosterone primarily acts on the distal nephron, specifically the collecting duct, where it promotes sodium reabsorption and potassium excretion, contributing to water retention and electrolyte balance. This aligns with the consensus that aldosterone increases sodium channels in the collecting duct, enhancing sodium reabsorption. The retrieved evidence paths, while broad, support the role of aldosterone in nephron processes related to excretory function and uptake, which are consistent with its action in the collecting duct. The glomerulus, proximal convoluted tubule, and loop of Henle are not primary sites of aldosterone action, as supported by standard physiological understanding.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Aldosterone is a hormone that plays a crucial role in regulating sodium and potassium balance in the body. It primarily acts on the distal nephron, specifically the collecting duct, where it enhances sodium reabsorption and potassium excretion. This action is well-documented in standard medical physiology, and the enhanced information provided aligns with this consensus. The other options, including the glomerulus, proximal convoluted tubule, and loop of Henle, are not primary sites of aldosterone action. Therefore, based on standard medical knowledge and the supporting enhanced information, the collecting duct is the most likely site of aldosterone action.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
