Ascaris\nopb. Filariasis\nopc. Malaria\nopd. Oncocerciasis\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nIvermectin is indicated for the treatment of Ascaris, Filariasis, and Oncocerciasis, as it is effective against these parasitic infections. The retrieved evidence path confirms that Ivermectin treats Filariasis, supporting its indication for this condition. However, Ivermectin is not effective against Malaria, and therefore, it is not indicated for this disease. This aligns with the standard medical consensus that Ivermectin is not used for treating Malaria.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Ivermectin is an antiparasitic medication primarily used to treat infections caused by certain parasites. It is indicated for the treatment of Ascaris (roundworm), Filariasis (caused by Wuchereria bancrofti and other filarial worms), and Oncocerciasis (river blindness caused by Onchocerca volvulus). However, Ivermectin is not effective against Malaria, which is caused by Plasmodium parasites and typically treated with antimalarial drugs such as chloroquine, artemisinin-based combination therapies, or other specific antimalarials. The enhanced information confirms that Ivermectin is not indicated for Malaria, aligning with standard medical consensus. Therefore, the most likely correct answer is that Ivermectin is not indicated for Malaria.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opc\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
