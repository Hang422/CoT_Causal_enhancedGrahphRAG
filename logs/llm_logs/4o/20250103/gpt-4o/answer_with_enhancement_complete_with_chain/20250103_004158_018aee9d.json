Fibrinolysis\nopb. Activation of collagenase\nopc. Destruction of VWF\nopd. Stabilization of fibrin\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nPlasmin is primarily known for its role in fibrinolysis, where it breaks down fibrin clots, which is a well-established function. This aligns with the consensus and is supported by evidence paths indicating plasmin's involvement in fibrinolysis. The activation of collagenase by plasmin is less well-documented but suggests a possible role in tissue remodeling, though this is not a primary function. The destruction of von Willebrand factor (VWF) by plasmin is possible, as plasmin can degrade various proteins, including VWF, but this is not its main function. The stabilization of fibrin contradicts the primary role of plasmin in fibrinolysis, as plasmin breaks down fibrin rather than stabilizing it. Therefore, the function of plasmin that is not aligned with its known roles is the stabilization of fibrin.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "
