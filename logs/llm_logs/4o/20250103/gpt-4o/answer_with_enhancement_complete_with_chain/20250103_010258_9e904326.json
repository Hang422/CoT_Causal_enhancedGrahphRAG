Dexamethasone\nopb. Betamethasone\nopc. Hydrocoisone\nopd. Prednisolone\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nCongenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) is often due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency, leading to excess androgen production and risk of virilization in a female fetus. The standard treatment involves using a glucocorticoid that can cross the placenta to suppress fetal adrenal androgen production. Dexamethasone is the drug of choice because it effectively crosses the placenta and suppresses fetal adrenal gland activity, thereby reducing androgen production and preventing virilization. The retrieved evidence paths, while broad, support the role of dexamethasone in treating conditions associated with excess androgen production, aligning with its use in CAH. Other options like betamethasone, hydrocortisone, and prednisolone are less preferred due to either lower placental transfer or different clinical indications. Therefore, dexamethasone is the consensus-supported choice for managing CAH in a pregnant female to prevent virilization in the fetus.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "
