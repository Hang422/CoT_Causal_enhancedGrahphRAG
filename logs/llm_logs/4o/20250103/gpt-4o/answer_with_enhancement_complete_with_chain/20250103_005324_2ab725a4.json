Aprepitant\nopb. Dexamethasone\nopc. Ondansetrin\nopd. All of the above\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nIn the context of chemotherapy-induced vomiting, all three drugs—Aprepitant, Dexamethasone, and Ondansetron—are used as antiemetics, each with distinct mechanisms of action. Aprepitant is an NK1 receptor antagonist that blocks substance P, effectively preventing vomiting. Dexamethasone, a corticosteroid, has anti-inflammatory properties that help reduce nausea. Ondansetron is a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist that blocks serotonin, preventing vomiting. The combination of these drugs provides complementary antiemetic effects, making 'All of the above' the most comprehensive option. The evidence paths confirm the roles of these drugs in their respective categories, supporting their use in managing chemotherapy-induced vomiting.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

Aprepitant, Dexamethasone, and Ondansetron each have distinct mechanisms of action that target different pathways involved in nausea and vomiting. Aprepitant is an NK1 receptor antagonist, Dexamethasone is a corticosteroid with anti-inflammatory effects, and Ondansetron is a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist. The use of all three drugs together is a common practice in clinical settings to provide comprehensive antiemetic coverage. Therefore, the option 'All of the above' is the most accurate and supported by medical consensus.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
