Sparfloxacin\nopb. Tetracycline\nopc. Gentamicin\nopd. Clofazimine\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nPseudotumour cerebri, also known as idiopathic intracranial hypertension, is a condition characterized by increased intracranial pressure without an obvious cause. Among the listed options, tetracycline is well-documented in medical literature as a drug that can cause Pseudotumour cerebri. This aligns with the reasoning chain that links tetracycline to increased intracranial pressure and subsequently to Pseudotumour cerebri. The other options, including sparfloxacin, gentamicin, and clofazimine, do not have a known association with Pseudotumour cerebri. The retrieved evidence path regarding clofazimine's effect on skin discoloration is irrelevant to the question of Pseudotumour cerebri and should not influence the decision. Therefore, the consensus supports tetracycline as the drug that can cause Pseudotumour cerebri.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Pseudotumour cerebri, or idiopathic intracranial hypertension, is a condition where there is increased intracranial pressure without a detectable cause. Certain medications are known to be associated with this condition, and tetracycline is one of the most well-documented drugs in this regard. The mechanism is not entirely understood, but it is believed that tetracycline can lead to increased intracranial pressure, possibly due to its effects on cerebrospinal fluid dynamics. The other options, sparfloxacin, gentamicin, and clofazimine, do not have a recognized association with Pseudotumour cerebri in the medical literature. Therefore, based on standard medical knowledge and consensus, tetracycline is the most likely drug to cause Pseudotumour cerebri.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
