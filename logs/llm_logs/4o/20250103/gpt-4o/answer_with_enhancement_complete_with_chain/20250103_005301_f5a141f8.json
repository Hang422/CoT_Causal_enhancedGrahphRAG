Hyponatremia\nopb. Hyperkalemia\nopc. Hypoglycemia\nopd. Metabolic alkalosis\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nAdrenal insufficiency is characterized by decreased production of aldosterone and cortisol. This leads to hyponatremia due to decreased sodium reabsorption and hyperkalemia due to decreased potassium excretion, both of which are consistent with standard medical consensus. Additionally, decreased cortisol results in reduced gluconeogenesis, causing hypoglycemia. Metabolic acidosis, not alkalosis, is associated with adrenal insufficiency due to decreased hydrogen ion excretion. The evidence paths related to hyperkalemia and metabolic acidosis support these points, confirming that metabolic alkalosis is not associated with adrenal insufficiency.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Adrenal insufficiency is characterized by a deficiency in the production of hormones such as aldosterone and cortisol. This hormonal deficiency leads to several physiological changes. The lack of aldosterone results in decreased sodium reabsorption and potassium excretion, causing hyponatremia and hyperkalemia, respectively. The deficiency in cortisol reduces gluconeogenesis, leading to hypoglycemia. Additionally, the lack of aldosterone can cause a buildup of hydrogen ions, resulting in metabolic acidosis. Metabolic alkalosis, on the other hand, is not associated with adrenal insufficiency, as it involves an increase in blood pH due to excessive bicarbonate or loss of hydrogen ions, which is contrary to the effects seen in adrenal insufficiency. Therefore, metabolic alkalosis is the condition not associated with adrenal insufficiency.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
