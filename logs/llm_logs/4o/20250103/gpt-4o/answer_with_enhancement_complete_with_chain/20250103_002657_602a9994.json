Atrial flutter\nopb. Parkinsonian tremor\nopc. Thyrotoxicosis\nopd. HOCM\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nPropranolol, a non-selective beta-blocker, is effective in managing atrial flutter by decreasing heart rate and controlling arrhythmias. It is also beneficial in thyrotoxicosis by reducing sympathetic overactivity, thus alleviating symptoms. However, propranolol is not typically used for Parkinsonian tremor, as it primarily affects essential tremor and not the tremor associated with Parkinson's disease. In hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM), propranolol can reduce heart rate but may exacerbate outflow obstruction due to its negative inotropic effects. Therefore, propranolol is not useful for Parkinsonian tremor, aligning with standard medical consensus.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "
