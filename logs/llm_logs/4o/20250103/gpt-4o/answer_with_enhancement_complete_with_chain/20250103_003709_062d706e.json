Hyoscine\nopb. Metoclopramide\nopc. Prochlorperazine\nopd. Ondansetron\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nHyoscine, also known as scopolamine, is an anticholinergic drug that effectively inhibits the vestibular system, making it useful in the prophylaxis of motion sickness. This aligns with the standard medical consensus that anticholinergics are effective for this purpose. Metoclopramide, Prochlorperazine, and Ondansetron are primarily dopamine and serotonin antagonists, respectively, and are more effective for treating nausea and vomiting related to other causes, such as chemotherapy or postoperative nausea, rather than specifically for motion sickness. The retrieved evidence paths confirm the roles of these drugs as dopamine and serotonin antagonists but do not provide additional relevant information for motion sickness prophylaxis. Therefore, Hyoscine is the most appropriate choice for preventing motion sickness.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Motion sickness is primarily caused by conflicting signals in the vestibular system, which can be effectively managed by anticholinergic drugs. Hyoscine, also known as scopolamine, is an anticholinergic that works by blocking acetylcholine receptors in the vestibular system, thereby preventing the symptoms of motion sickness. This aligns with the standard medical consensus that anticholinergics are effective for this purpose. The other options, Metoclopramide, Prochlorperazine, and Ondansetron, are primarily used for nausea and vomiting due to other causes, such as chemotherapy or postoperative conditions, and are not typically used for motion sickness prophylaxis. Therefore, based on the pharmacological action and standard medical practice, Hyoscine is the most appropriate choice for preventing motion sickness.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
