Stagnant hypoxia\nopb. Anemic hypoxia\nopc. Hypoxic hypoxia\nopd. Histotoxic hypoxia\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nShock is primarily associated with stagnant hypoxia due to decreased blood flow and reduced oxygen delivery to tissues, which aligns with the consensus that shock leads to impaired circulation. The evidence path indicating shock as a manifestation of hemorrhage supports this, as hemorrhage can cause reduced blood flow. Anemic hypoxia can occur in shock due to blood loss and reduced hemoglobin levels, but it is less directly linked compared to stagnant hypoxia. Hypoxic hypoxia, characterized by impaired oxygen delivery, is a possible but less specific outcome of shock. Histotoxic hypoxia, where cells cannot utilize oxygen despite normal delivery, is not typically caused by shock, as shock primarily affects circulation rather than cellular oxygen utilization. Therefore, stagnant hypoxia is the most directly related to shock.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Shock is a condition characterized by inadequate tissue perfusion and oxygenation due to impaired circulation. The primary type of hypoxia associated with shock is stagnant hypoxia, which occurs when there is a reduction in blood flow, leading to decreased oxygen delivery to tissues. This aligns with the consensus that shock leads to impaired circulation, making stagnant hypoxia the most directly related type of hypoxia in this context. While anemic hypoxia can occur due to blood loss in shock, it is less directly linked compared to stagnant hypoxia. Hypoxic hypoxia and histotoxic hypoxia are less relevant in the context of shock, as they involve different mechanisms of impaired oxygen delivery or utilization. Therefore, stagnant hypoxia is the most likely correct answer.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}",
