Ethanolamine oleate\nopb. Octreotide\nopc. Propanolol\nopd. Phytonadione\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nThe drug of choice for bleeding oesophageal varices is Octreotide. Octreotide works by causing vasoconstriction of the splanchnic circulation, which reduces portal pressure and helps control bleeding from oesophageal varices. This aligns with the consensus that Octreotide is effective in acute management of variceal bleeding due to its ability to reduce portal hypertension. Propranolol, while useful in preventing variceal bleeding by reducing portal hypertension through beta-blockade, is not the first choice for acute bleeding. Ethanolamine oleate is used in sclerotherapy to obliterate varices but is not the primary pharmacological choice. Phytonadione (Vitamin K) improves coagulation but is not directly effective in controlling variceal bleeding. The evidence paths confirm Octreotide's role in treating conditions related to blood circulation, supporting its use in this context.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"In the management of acute bleeding oesophageal varices, the primary goal is to control the bleeding and reduce portal pressure. Octreotide, a somatostatin analogue, is widely recognized for its ability to cause vasoconstriction in the splanchnic circulation, thereby reducing portal pressure and controlling bleeding. This aligns with the consensus in medical practice that Octreotide is the drug of choice for acute management of variceal bleeding. Propranolol is used for prophylaxis to prevent bleeding by reducing portal hypertension but is not suitable for acute bleeding. Ethanolamine oleate is used in sclerotherapy, and Phytonadione (Vitamin K) is used to correct coagulopathy but does not directly address the bleeding varices. Therefore, based on standard medical knowledge and consensus, Octreotide is the most appropriate choice for acute bleeding oesophageal varices.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
