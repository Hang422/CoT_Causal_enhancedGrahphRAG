Liver\nopb. Adipose tissue\nopc. RBC\nopd. Brain\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nThe Hexose Monophosphate (HMP) shunt, also known as the pentose phosphate pathway, is present in most cells as it provides NADPH for reductive biosynthesis and ribose-5-phosphate for nucleotide synthesis. In the liver, adipose tissue, and brain, the HMP shunt is active due to their need for NADPH in fatty acid synthesis and other biosynthetic processes. In red blood cells (RBCs), the HMP shunt is crucial for generating NADPH to maintain reduced glutathione, which protects against oxidative damage. The reasoning chain suggesting the HMP shunt does not occur in RBCs due to the lack of mitochondria is incorrect, as the pathway is cytosolic and does not require mitochondria. Therefore, the HMP shunt occurs in RBCs despite their lack of mitochondria. The correct answer is that the HMP shunt occurs in all the listed organs, including RBCs, and the question may be misleading as it implies an exception that does not exist based on standard biochemical consensus.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "
