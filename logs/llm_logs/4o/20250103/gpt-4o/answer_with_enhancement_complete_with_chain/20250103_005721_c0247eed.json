Inactivation of serotonin\nopb. Conversion of angiotensin–I to angiotensin–II\nopc. Inactivation of bradykinin\nopd. Metabolism of basic drugs by cytochrome P–450 system\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nThe best-known metabolic function of the lung is the conversion of angiotensin-I to angiotensin-II. This process is facilitated by the presence of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) in the lungs, which is a well-established fact in medical physiology. While the lung does participate in the inactivation of bradykinin and serotonin, these functions are not as prominently recognized as the conversion of angiotensin-I to angiotensin-II. The metabolism of basic drugs by the cytochrome P-450 system is primarily a function of the liver, not the lung. Therefore, the conversion of angiotensin-I to angiotensin-II is the most significant and well-known metabolic function of the lung.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "
