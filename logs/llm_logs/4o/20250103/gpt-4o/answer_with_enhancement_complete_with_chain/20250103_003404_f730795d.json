B1\nopb. B2\nopc. B6\nopd. B12\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nWernicke's encephalopathy is primarily caused by a deficiency in thiamine, which is vitamin B1. This condition is often associated with chronic alcoholism, which can lead to malnutrition and subsequently thiamine deficiency. The symptoms of Wernicke's encephalopathy, such as neurological symptoms, confusion, ataxia, and ocular abnormalities, are directly linked to thiamine deficiency. The retrieved evidence paths support this by showing the connection between Wernicke's encephalopathy and thiamine deficiency, as well as the role of chronic alcoholism in causing malnutrition and thiamine deficiency. Therefore, the major vitamin deficiency in Wernicke's encephalopathy is vitamin B1.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "
