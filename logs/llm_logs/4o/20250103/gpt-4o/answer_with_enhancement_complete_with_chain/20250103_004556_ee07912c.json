Cinchonism\nopb. Hyperglycemia\nopc. Hypoglycemia\nopd. Hypokalemia\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nQuinine is known to cause hypoglycemia due to increased insulin secretion, which can lead to symptoms like sweating and palpitation. This aligns with the consensus that hypoglycemia is a likely cause of these symptoms in patients treated with quinine. While quinine can have cardiac effects, leading to palpitations, these are more commonly associated with cinchonism, which typically includes tinnitus and visual disturbances, not just sweating and palpitations. Hypokalemia is less directly linked to quinine use and is not a primary cause of the symptoms described. Hyperglycemia is not a recognized effect of quinine and is unlikely to be the cause. Therefore, the most consensus-supported explanation for the symptoms of sweating and palpitation in this context is hypoglycemia.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "
