Which of the following enzymes is defective?\n\n                    ### Options\n                    opa. Fructokinase\nopb. Aldolase A\nopc. Aldolase B\nopd. Sucrase\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nThe symptoms of vomiting, lethargy, and severe jaundice in a 6-month-old baby after weaning with fruit juice suggest a defect in fructose metabolism. The standard medical consensus indicates that Aldolase B is crucial for the metabolism of fructose-1-phosphate, a key step in fructose metabolism. A deficiency in Aldolase B leads to hereditary fructose intolerance, characterized by the accumulation of toxic metabolites such as fructose-1-phosphate, causing severe symptoms like vomiting, lethargy, and jaundice. The reasoning chain for Aldolase B aligns with this consensus, making it the most likely enzyme defect. Fructokinase deficiency, while related to fructose metabolism, typically results in benign fructosuria without severe symptoms. Aldolase A is not primarily involved in fructose metabolism, and sucrase is unrelated to fructose metabolism. Therefore, the defective enzyme is most likely Aldolase B.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

The key enzyme involved in the metabolism of fructose-1-phosphate is Aldolase B.
