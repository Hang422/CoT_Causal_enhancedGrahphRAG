Acute renal failure\nopb. Development of antiplatelet antibodies\nopc. Encephalitis secondary to liver dysfunction\nopd. Hemorrhagic stroke\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nFibrinolytic drugs, used to dissolve blood clots in the treatment of acute myocardial infarction, increase the risk of bleeding due to systemic fibrinolysis. This increased bleeding tendency can lead to hemorrhagic complications, with hemorrhagic stroke being a significant adverse effect. The reasoning chains correctly identify the pathway from fibrinolytic drug use to hemorrhagic stroke through mechanisms such as plasmin formation and degradation of fibrin, which align with the consensus that these drugs can cause systemic bleeding. The retrieved evidence paths support this by linking fibrinolytic agents to hemorrhage and hemorrhagic stroke, confirming that hemorrhagic stroke is the most likely adverse effect of fibrinolytic therapy in this context.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Fibrinolytic drugs, such as tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), are used to dissolve clots in the treatment of acute myocardial infarction. These drugs work by converting plasminogen to plasmin, which then degrades fibrin and dissolves the clot. However, this mechanism also increases the risk of systemic bleeding, as it affects the body's ability to maintain hemostasis. Among the potential adverse effects, hemorrhagic stroke is a well-documented and significant risk associated with fibrinolytic therapy. This is due to the increased bleeding tendency caused by the systemic action of these drugs. Other options, such as acute renal failure, development of antiplatelet antibodies, and encephalitis secondary to liver dysfunction, are not commonly associated with fibrinolytic therapy. Therefore, based on standard medical knowledge and consensus, hemorrhagic stroke is the most likely adverse effect of fibrinolytic drugs in the treatment of acute myocardial infarction.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
