This range is crucial for its use as a bronchodilator in conditions like asthma and COPD, where effective bronchodilation is achieved within this range. Theophylline has a narrow therapeutic index, necessitating careful monitoring to avoid toxicity, which occurs above 20 micrograms per liter. The retrieved evidence path confirms theophylline's role as a bronchodilator, supporting its therapeutic use within the 10-20 microgram per liter range. Therefore, the correct therapeutic range is 10-20 micrograms per liter, aligning with standard medical consensus.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The therapeutic blood range of theophylline is a well-established parameter in pharmacology. Theophylline is used primarily as a bronchodilator in the treatment of respiratory diseases such as asthma and COPD. The standard therapeutic range is 10-20 micrograms per liter, which is crucial for achieving effective bronchodilation while minimizing the risk of toxicity. Theophylline has a narrow therapeutic index, meaning that levels above 20 micrograms per liter can lead to toxic effects. Therefore, the most likely correct option based on standard medical knowledge and consensus is 10-20 micrograms per liter.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
