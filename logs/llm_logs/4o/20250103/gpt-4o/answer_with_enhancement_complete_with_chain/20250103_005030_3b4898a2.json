Meningitis\nopb. Pericarditis\nopc. Ileo-caecal tuberculosis\nopd. Adrenal involvement\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nSteroids are indicated in tuberculous meningitis and pericarditis due to their anti-inflammatory effects, as inflammation is a key component in these conditions. The evidence paths support this by showing the interaction of steroids with inflammation-related genes (IL13, ELAVL2) in the meninges and pericardium. In ileo-caecal tuberculosis, steroids are not typically used as it is a localized intestinal infection where anti-inflammatory treatment is not standard. For adrenal tuberculosis, while steroids mimic adrenal hormones, they are not primarily used for inflammation in this context, and the evidence paths confirm their role in hormone preparation rather than treating inflammation. Therefore, steroids are not indicated in ileo-caecal tuberculosis.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"In the management of tuberculosis, steroids are used as adjunctive therapy in certain forms where inflammation plays a significant role in the disease's morbidity. Tuberculous meningitis and pericarditis are conditions where inflammation can lead to severe complications, and steroids are used to reduce this inflammation. In ileo-caecal tuberculosis, the primary treatment is anti-tubercular drugs, and steroids are not typically indicated as the condition is a localized intestinal infection without the same inflammatory complications. In adrenal tuberculosis, while steroids may be used to replace adrenal hormones if the gland is destroyed, they are not used to treat inflammation. Therefore, the most likely correct answer, based on standard medical knowledge, is that steroids are not indicated in ileo-caecal tuberculosis.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opc\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}",
