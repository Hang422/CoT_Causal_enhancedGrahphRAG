None of the above\nopb. Albumin\nopc. Globulins\nopd. Chylomicrons\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nFree fatty acids are transported in the blood bound to albumin, which is a well-established consensus in biochemistry. Albumin acts as a carrier for free fatty acids, facilitating their transport to cells where they can enter mitochondria for oxidation. The retrieved evidence path supports this by indicating that nonesterified fatty acids are associated with albumins. Globulins and chylomicrons do not transport free fatty acids; globulins primarily transport hormones and vitamins, while chylomicrons are involved in the transport of dietary lipids from the intestines. Therefore, the correct option is that free fatty acids are transported by albumin.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

Albumin acts as a carrier for free fatty acids, facilitating their transport to various tissues, including muscle and liver, where they can be taken up by cells and enter mitochondria for oxidation. This is a consensus in the field, and the enhanced information supports this understanding. Globulins and chylomicrons do not serve this function; globulins are more involved in transporting hormones and vitamins, while chylomicrons transport dietary lipids from the intestines.
