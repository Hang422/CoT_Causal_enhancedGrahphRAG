Alpha IEN\nopb. Beta IFN\nopc. Gamma IFN\nopd. Natalizumab\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nFor relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS), the drug of choice is typically Beta Interferon (Beta IFN). Beta IFN modulates the immune response, reduces inflammation, and decreases the relapse rate, which aligns with the standard medical consensus for RRMS treatment. Natalizumab is also used in RRMS, as it blocks immune cell migration and prevents CNS inflammation, thereby reducing relapse frequency. However, it is generally considered when patients do not respond to first-line treatments like Beta IFN. Gamma Interferon is not recommended for MS as it may worsen symptoms, and Alpha IEN lacks an established benefit for MS. The retrieved evidence paths do not directly support the use of Natalizumab for RRMS, as they are too broad and unrelated to MS treatment. Therefore, Beta IFN remains the primary consensus-supported choice for RRMS.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) is commonly treated with disease-modifying therapies that aim to reduce the frequency and severity of relapses. Beta Interferon (Beta IFN) is a well-established first-line treatment for RRMS. It works by modulating the immune system to reduce inflammation and decrease the relapse rate. Natalizumab is another effective treatment for RRMS, but it is typically reserved for patients who do not respond adequately to first-line therapies like Beta IFN due to its risk profile, including the potential for progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). Gamma Interferon is not used in MS treatment as it can exacerbate the disease, and Alpha IEN is not recognized as a treatment for MS. Based on standard medical knowledge and consensus, Beta IFN is the drug of choice for RRMS.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
