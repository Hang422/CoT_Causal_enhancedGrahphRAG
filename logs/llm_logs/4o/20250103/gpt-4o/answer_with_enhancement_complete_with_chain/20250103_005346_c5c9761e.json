Salbutamol\nopb. Ketotifen\nopc. Fluticasone\nopd. Monteleukast\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nSalbutamol is a beta adrenergic agonist that causes bronchodilation and is available in aerosol form, making it suitable for the treatment of bronchial asthma. This aligns with the consensus that beta agonists like Salbutamol are commonly used in inhalers for asthma management. Ketotifen is an antihistamine, not a beta adrenergic agonist, and is not typically used in aerosol form for asthma. Fluticasone is a corticosteroid used in asthma management for its anti-inflammatory properties and is available in aerosol form, but it is not a beta adrenergic agonist. Montelukast is a leukotriene receptor antagonist, administered orally, and not used as an aerosol, nor is it a beta adrenergic agonist. Therefore, Salbutamol is the correct answer for a beta adrenergic agonist used as an aerosol for bronchial asthma treatment.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The question asks for a beta adrenergic agonist used as an aerosol for the treatment of bronchial asthma. Salbutamol is a well-known beta-2 adrenergic agonist that is commonly used in inhaler form to provide quick relief from asthma symptoms by causing bronchodilation. Ketotifen is an antihistamine and not a beta adrenergic agonist, thus not used in aerosol form for asthma. Fluticasone, while available in aerosol form, is a corticosteroid and not a beta adrenergic agonist. Montelukast is a leukotriene receptor antagonist, taken orally, and not used as an aerosol. Therefore, based on standard medical knowledge and consensus, Salbutamol is the correct choice for a beta adrenergic agonist used as an aerosol in asthma treatment.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
