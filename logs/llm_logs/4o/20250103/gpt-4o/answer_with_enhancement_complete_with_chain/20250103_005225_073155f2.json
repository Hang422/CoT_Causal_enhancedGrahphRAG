Platelet dysfunction\nopb. Aspirin inhibits the action of heparin\nopc. Enhanced hypersensitivity of heparin\nopd. Therapy of heparin cannot be monitored\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nAspirin is not given to a patient who is already on heparin primarily because it causes platelet dysfunction, which increases the risk of bleeding. Aspirin inhibits cyclooxygenase, leading to reduced thromboxane A2 production, which is crucial for platelet aggregation. This results in platelet dysfunction and an increased bleeding tendency, especially when combined with heparin, an anticoagulant. The retrieved evidence supports this by linking platelet dysfunction and hemorrhage with heparin use. There is no evidence or consensus to suggest that aspirin directly inhibits heparin's action, enhances hypersensitivity to heparin, or affects the monitoring of heparin therapy. Therefore, the correct reason for avoiding aspirin in patients on heparin is due to the increased risk of bleeding from platelet dysfunction.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Aspirin is known to cause platelet dysfunction by inhibiting the enzyme cyclooxygenase, which reduces the production of thromboxane A2, a molecule essential for platelet aggregation. This leads to an increased risk of bleeding. When a patient is on heparin, an anticoagulant, the combination with aspirin can significantly increase the risk of bleeding due to the additive effects on the coagulation pathway. There is no evidence to suggest that aspirin inhibits the action of heparin, enhances hypersensitivity to heparin, or affects the monitoring of heparin therapy. Therefore, the primary reason for avoiding aspirin in patients on heparin is due to the risk of bleeding from platelet dysfunction.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
