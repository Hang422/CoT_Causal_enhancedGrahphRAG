Krabbe's disease\nopb. Fabry's disease\nopc. Fragile syndrome\nopd. All\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nGlycogen storage diseases are a group of metabolic disorders that specifically involve the storage and metabolism of glycogen. Krabbe's disease, Fabry's disease, and Fragile X syndrome are not related to glycogen metabolism. Krabbe's disease is a lysosomal storage disorder affecting the nervous system, Fabry's disease is a lysosomal storage disorder affecting multiple organs, and Fragile X syndrome is a genetic disorder affecting intellectual development. None of these conditions are classified as glycogen storage diseases. Therefore, the correct answer is that all the options listed (Krabbe's disease, Fabry's disease, Fragile X syndrome) are not glycogen storage diseases.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "
