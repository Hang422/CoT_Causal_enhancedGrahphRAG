Striated\nopb. Large T tubules\nopc. Troponin system present\nopd. Caldesmon is impoant regulatory protein\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nCardiac muscle is characterized by a striated appearance, similar to skeletal muscle, due to the arrangement of actin and myosin filaments, which is a consensus fact. It also features large T tubules that facilitate efficient calcium handling, crucial for cardiac muscle contraction. The presence of the troponin system in cardiac muscle is well-established, as it plays a key role in the regulation of contraction by binding calcium ions. However, caldesmon is not an important regulatory protein in cardiac muscle; it is more relevant in smooth muscle regulation. The retrieved evidence path mentioning caldesmon in relation to the myocardium is misleading in this context, as it does not apply to cardiac muscle regulation. Therefore, the correct answer is that caldesmon is not a feature of cardiac muscle.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Cardiac muscle is known for its striated appearance due to the organized arrangement of actin and myosin filaments, similar to skeletal muscle. It also has large T tubules that are essential for calcium handling, which is crucial for muscle contraction. The troponin system is present in cardiac muscle and plays a significant role in regulating contraction by interacting with calcium ions. Caldesmon, however, is not a regulatory protein associated with cardiac muscle; it is primarily involved in the regulation of smooth muscle contraction. Therefore, the feature that does not belong to cardiac muscle is the presence of caldesmon as an important regulatory protein.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
