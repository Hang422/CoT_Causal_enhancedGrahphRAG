This hormone is:\n\n                    ### Options\n                    opa. Endothelial growth factor (EGF)\nopb. Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG)\nopc. Human chorionic somatotropin (HCS)\nopd. Relaxin\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nThe hormone secreted by the placenta that is utilized in the early detection of pregnancy is human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). This is supported by the consensus that hCG is produced by the placenta shortly after implantation and can be detected in both urine and blood, making it a reliable marker for early pregnancy tests. The retrieved evidence paths, while broad, confirm that hCG is involved in early diagnosis processes. Other options, such as endothelial growth factor (EGF), human chorionic somatotropin (HCS), and relaxin, do not align with the consensus for early pregnancy detection. Therefore, hCG is the correct answer.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "
