Contraction of gall bladder\nopb. Secretion of pancreatic juice rich in enzymes\nopc. Increases the secretion of enterokinase\nopd. All\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nCholecystokinin (CCK) is a hormone known to stimulate the contraction of the gallbladder, leading to the release of bile, and to stimulate the pancreas to secrete pancreatic juice rich in digestive enzymes. These actions are well-supported by physiological consensus. The evidence paths confirm CCK's role in gallbladder contraction and pancreatic enzyme secretion, aligning with the consensus. However, the effect of CCK on enterokinase secretion is not well-established or supported by strong evidence, making it less likely to be a primary action of CCK. Therefore, the most accurate actions of CCK are the contraction of the gallbladder and the secretion of enzyme-rich pancreatic juice, supporting options 'opa' and 'opb'. Option 'opd' is incorrect as it includes an unsupported action regarding enterokinase.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Cholecystokinin (CCK) is a well-studied hormone with established roles in the digestive system. It is primarily known for stimulating the contraction of the gallbladder, which facilitates the release of bile into the small intestine. Additionally, CCK stimulates the pancreas to secrete pancreatic juice that is rich in digestive enzymes, aiding in the digestion of fats and proteins. These actions are well-supported by physiological consensus. However, the role of CCK in increasing the secretion of enterokinase is not well-documented or supported by strong evidence in the medical literature. Therefore, the most accurate actions of CCK are the contraction of the gallbladder and the secretion of enzyme-rich pancreatic juice, supporting options 'opa' and 'opb'. Since option 'opd' includes an unsupported action regarding enterokinase, it is not the correct choice.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}",
