Selenium\nopb. Phosphorus\nopc. Boron\nopd. Zinc\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nSelenium deficiency is well-documented to cause oxidative stress, which can lead to cardiomyopathy, making it the most likely option linked to cardiomyopathy. Phosphorus deficiency may cause muscle weakness, but there is no clear consensus linking it directly to cardiomyopathy. Boron deficiency lacks a clear physiological impact related to cardiomyopathy. Zinc deficiency can lead to immune dysfunction, which might have indirect effects on cardiac health, but it is not directly linked to cardiomyopathy. The evidence path regarding paresis and disease leading to cardiomyopathies is too broad and does not specifically support any of the options. Therefore, selenium deficiency is the most consensus-supported cause of cardiomyopathy among the options provided.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Cardiomyopathy is a disease of the heart muscle that can be caused by various factors, including nutritional deficiencies. Among the options provided, selenium deficiency is the most well-documented cause of cardiomyopathy. Selenium is an essential trace element that plays a critical role in protecting cells from oxidative damage through its incorporation into selenoproteins, such as glutathione peroxidase. A deficiency in selenium can lead to increased oxidative stress, which is known to contribute to the development of cardiomyopathy. This is supported by the condition known as Keshan disease, a type of cardiomyopathy linked to selenium deficiency. The other options, phosphorus, boron, and zinc, do not have a strong or direct association with cardiomyopathy. Therefore, based on standard medical knowledge and the enhanced information provided, selenium deficiency is the most likely cause of cardiomyopathy among the options given.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
