Endometrial carcinoma\nopc. >Carcinoma in contralateral breast\nopd. >Cataract\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nTamoxifen is known to increase the risk of thromboembolism and endometrial carcinoma, which aligns with standard medical consensus and is supported by evidence paths. It also has a known association with an increased risk of cataracts. However, tamoxifen is generally considered to have a protective effect against contralateral breast cancer, rather than increasing the risk. Therefore, the adverse effect not typically associated with tamoxifen use is 'carcinoma in contralateral breast.'\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Tamoxifen is a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) commonly used in the treatment of estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer. It is well-documented to increase the risk of thromboembolism and endometrial carcinoma due to its estrogenic effects on the endometrium and pro-thrombotic effects. Additionally, tamoxifen has been associated with an increased risk of cataracts. However, tamoxifen is known to reduce the risk of developing cancer in the contralateral breast, as it acts as an estrogen antagonist in breast tissue. Therefore, the adverse effect not typically associated with tamoxifen use is 'carcinoma in contralateral breast.' This aligns with standard medical knowledge and consensus.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opc\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
