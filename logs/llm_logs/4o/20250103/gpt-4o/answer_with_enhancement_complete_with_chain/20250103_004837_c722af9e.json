All of the following are true about heparin except-\n\n                    ### Options\n                    opa. Weakest acid found in living things\nopb. Most commercial preparations of heparin now utilize pig intestinal slimes\nopc. Act via Antithrombin activation\nopd. Produce thrombocytopenia\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nHeparin is a widely used anticoagulant in cardiac surgery. It acts primarily through the activation of Antithrombin, which is a well-established mechanism of action. Most commercial preparations of heparin are derived from pig intestinal mucosa, which aligns with current manufacturing practices. A known side effect of heparin is thrombocytopenia, a condition characterized by a low platelet count. However, the statement that heparin is the 'weakest acid found in living things' is incorrect and not supported by biochemical consensus. Heparin is a highly sulfated glycosaminoglycan, which does not make it the weakest acid in living organisms. Therefore, the correct answer is that heparin is not the weakest acid found in living things.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "
