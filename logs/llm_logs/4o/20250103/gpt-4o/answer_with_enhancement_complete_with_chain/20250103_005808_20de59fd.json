Vitamin A\nopb. Vitamin K\nopc. Vitamin E\nopd. Vitamin D\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nVitamin K is the only fat-soluble vitamin among the options that functions as a coenzyme. It plays a crucial role in the gamma-carboxylation of certain glutamate residues in proteins involved in blood coagulation, acting as a coenzyme for the enzyme gamma-glutamyl carboxylase. The retrieved evidence paths support this by associating Vitamin K with blood coagulation factors, confirming its role in coagulation processes. In contrast, Vitamin A is primarily involved in vision and skin health, Vitamin E functions as an antioxidant protecting cell membranes, and Vitamin D is involved in calcium homeostasis and bone health. None of these other vitamins function as coenzymes, aligning with the consensus that Vitamin K is unique in this regard.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The question asks which fat-soluble vitamin functions as a coenzyme. Among the options, Vitamin K is well-documented to act as a coenzyme. It is essential for the gamma-carboxylation of glutamate residues in proteins, a critical step in the blood coagulation process. This role is facilitated by its function as a coenzyme for the enzyme gamma-glutamyl carboxylase. In contrast, the other vitamins listed do not serve as coenzymes. Vitamin A is involved in vision and epithelial health, Vitamin E acts as an antioxidant, and Vitamin D is crucial for calcium regulation and bone health. Therefore, based on standard medical knowledge and consensus, Vitamin K is the only fat-soluble vitamin among the options that functions as a coenzyme.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
