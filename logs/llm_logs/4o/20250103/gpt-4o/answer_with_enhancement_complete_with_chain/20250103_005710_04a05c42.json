Penicillin G\nopb. Tetracycline\nopc. Azithromycin\nopd. Doxycycline\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nThe drug of choice for Treponema pallidum, which causes syphilis, is Penicillin G. This is supported by medical consensus as Penicillin G is highly effective against syphilis and is the first-line treatment. Tetracycline and Doxycycline are alternative treatments, typically used when there is a penicillin allergy, but they are less effective than Penicillin G. Azithromycin is sometimes used, but due to resistance concerns, it is not considered a first-line treatment. The retrieved evidence path broadly associates syphilis with pharmaceutical preparations, which aligns with the consensus that specific antibiotics are used to treat bacterial infections like syphilis.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Treponema pallidum is the bacterium responsible for syphilis. The standard medical treatment for syphilis is Penicillin G, which is highly effective and considered the first-line therapy. This is supported by medical consensus and guidelines, which recommend Penicillin G as the drug of choice due to its efficacy in treating all stages of syphilis. Alternatives like Tetracycline and Doxycycline are used primarily in cases of penicillin allergy, but they are not as effective as Penicillin G. Azithromycin is not typically used as a first-line treatment due to concerns about resistance. Therefore, based on the consensus and standard medical practice, Penicillin G is the most appropriate choice.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
