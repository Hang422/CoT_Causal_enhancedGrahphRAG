Retinol\nopb. Retinal\nopc. Retinoic acids\nopd. All of the above\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nVitamin A is a group of compounds that includes retinol, retinal, and retinoic acids, each playing distinct roles in the body. Retinol is crucial for vision and immune function, retinal is essential for vision, particularly in the retina, and retinoic acids are involved in regulating gene expression. The reasoning chain for each option aligns with the consensus that vitamin A functions are related to all these forms. The evidence paths, while broad, support the involvement of vitamin A in retinal processes, confirming its role in vision. Therefore, the correct answer is that the function of vitamin A is related to all of the above: retinol, retinal, and retinoic acids.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "
