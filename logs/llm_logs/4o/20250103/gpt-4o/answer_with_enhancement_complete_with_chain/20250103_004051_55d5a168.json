Spectrin\nopb. Ankyrin\nopc. Tubulin\nopd. Laminin\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nThe plasma membrane of a cell is connected to the cytoskeleton primarily through the interaction of spectrin and ankyrin. Spectrin is a cytoskeletal protein that binds to the plasma membrane, helping to stabilize cell shape. Ankyrin acts as an anchor, connecting spectrin to membrane proteins, thereby linking the cytoskeleton to the plasma membrane. This interaction is well-supported by evidence showing that ankyrin interacts with spectrin in cells, particularly erythrocytes. Tubulin, while a component of microtubules, does not directly bind to the plasma membrane, and its role is more structural within the cytoskeleton itself. Laminin is an extracellular matrix protein and does not directly participate in binding the cytoskeleton to the plasma membrane. Therefore, the most accurate answer is that ankyrin facilitates the connection between the plasma membrane and the cytoskeleton by anchoring spectrin.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The plasma membrane is connected to the cytoskeleton through a network of proteins that include spectrin and ankyrin. Spectrin is a cytoskeletal protein that provides structural support and helps maintain the shape of the cell. Ankyrin acts as an intermediary, anchoring spectrin to integral membrane proteins, thus linking the cytoskeleton to the plasma membrane. This interaction is particularly well-documented in erythrocytes, where it plays a crucial role in maintaining cell integrity. Tubulin, while a key component of microtubules, does not directly bind to the plasma membrane. Laminin is part of the extracellular matrix and does not directly connect the cytoskeleton to the plasma membrane. Therefore, the most accurate answer is that ankyrin facilitates this connection by anchoring spectrin to the membrane.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
