Aldosterone\nopb. DOCA\nopc. Fludrocoeisone\nopd. Triamcinolone\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nAldosterone is the most potent mineralocorticoid, characterized by its strong sodium retention and significant impact on increasing blood volume, which aligns with its role in causing hypernatremia. Fludrocortisone also exhibits strong mineralocorticoid activity but is primarily used for its glucocorticoid effects, making it less potent than aldosterone in mineralocorticoid terms. DOCA (Desoxycorticosterone acetate) has moderate mineralocorticoid activity, causing hypernatremia but is less potent than aldosterone. Triamcinolone has minimal mineralocorticoid activity and is primarily a glucocorticoid, making it the least potent in this category. Therefore, based on consensus and evidence, aldosterone is the most potent mineralocorticoid.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Mineralocorticoids are hormones that regulate electrolyte and water balance by acting on the kidneys. Aldosterone is the primary and most potent endogenous mineralocorticoid, known for its strong effects on sodium retention and potassium excretion, which directly influence blood volume and pressure. Fludrocortisone, while having significant mineralocorticoid activity, is primarily used for its glucocorticoid effects and is not as potent as aldosterone in terms of mineralocorticoid activity. DOCA (Desoxycorticosterone acetate) has moderate mineralocorticoid activity but is less potent than aldosterone. Triamcinolone is primarily a glucocorticoid with minimal mineralocorticoid activity. Based on standard medical knowledge and consensus, aldosterone is recognized as the most potent mineralocorticoid.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
