This results in polyuria and the production of dilute urine with low osmolality. Standard medical consensus indicates that urine osmolality in Diabetes insipidus is typically less than 300 mmol/L. The retrieved evidence path supports the link between Diabetes insipidus and polyuria, which is consistent with the condition's characteristic of producing dilute urine. Therefore, the most accurate option is that urine osmolality in Diabetes insipidus is <300 mmol/L.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "
