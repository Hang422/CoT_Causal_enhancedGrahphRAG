Chlorothiazide\nopb. Beta blockers\nopc. ACE inhibitors\nopd. Amlodipine\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nSpironolactone is a potassium-sparing diuretic that can lead to increased potassium levels, posing a risk of hyperkalemia. ACE inhibitors also increase potassium levels, and their concurrent use with spironolactone is contraindicated due to the significant risk of hyperkalemia. Chlorothiazide, a thiazide diuretic, promotes potassium excretion and may counteract spironolactone's potassium retention, but it is not contraindicated. Beta blockers and amlodipine do not have a direct effect on potassium levels and are not contraindicated with spironolactone. The evidence paths confirm spironolactone's role in potassium retention and the risk of hyperkalemia, supporting the contraindication with ACE inhibitors.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Spironolactone is a potassium-sparing diuretic, which means it can increase potassium levels in the body. ACE inhibitors also have the potential to increase potassium levels. When used together, the risk of hyperkalemia is significantly increased, which can be dangerous. Therefore, the concurrent use of spironolactone and ACE inhibitors is contraindicated. Chlorothiazide, on the other hand, is a thiazide diuretic that promotes potassium excretion and can be used to counteract the potassium-retaining effects of spironolactone. Beta blockers and amlodipine do not have a direct effect on potassium levels and are not contraindicated with spironolactone. Based on this information, the most likely correct option is that ACE inhibitors are contraindicated with spironolactone.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opc\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
