Single dose in ascariasis\nopb. Immunostimulant\nopc. Paralysis of worms by depolarisation\nopd. Immunodepressant in high doses\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nLevamisole is used as a single dose treatment for ascariasis, which aligns with its known efficacy in treating this parasitic infection. It acts as an immunostimulant, enhancing the immune response, which is supported by its association with immunologic adjuvants. Levamisole causes paralysis of worms through depolarization of worm muscles, a well-established mechanism of action. However, its use as an immunodepressant in high doses is not widely accepted or supported by standard medical consensus, making this option the exception. The retrieved evidence paths support its role in treating ascariasis and its immunostimulant properties but do not substantiate its use as an immunodepressant.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Levamisole is a medication with multiple uses. It is well-documented as a single-dose treatment for ascariasis (option opa), where it effectively targets parasitic worms. It also acts as an immunostimulant (option opb), enhancing the immune response, which is supported by its use in certain immunologic conditions. The mechanism of action of levamisole involves causing paralysis of worms through depolarization (option opc), which is a well-established pharmacological effect. However, the use of levamisole as an immunodepressant in high doses (option opd) is not supported by standard medical literature or consensus. There is no substantial evidence or common practice supporting its role as an immunodepressant, making this option the exception. Therefore, based on standard medical knowledge and consensus, the most likely correct answer is that levamisole is not used as an immunodepressant in high doses.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
