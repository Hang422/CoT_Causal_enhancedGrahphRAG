Osteoporosis\nopb. Endometrial hyperplasia\nopc. Ovarian cancer\nopd. Decreased triglyceride level\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nTamoxifen is a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) that can cause endometrial hyperplasia due to its partial agonist effect on the endometrium, which is a well-documented side effect. This aligns with the consensus that tamoxifen increases the risk of endometrial changes. While tamoxifen has a complex effect on bone density, it is generally not associated with causing osteoporosis; rather, it may have a protective effect on bone in postmenopausal women. The evidence path related to bone density and menopause is not directly relevant to tamoxifen's effects. Tamoxifen is known to decrease triglyceride levels, which is consistent with its modulation of estrogen receptors affecting lipid metabolism. The link between tamoxifen and ovarian cancer is less clear, with no strong consensus supporting a direct causative relationship. Therefore, the most consensus-aligned effects of tamoxifen are endometrial hyperplasia and decreased triglyceride levels.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "
