Tamsulosin\nopb. Prazosin\nopc. Oxazocin\nopd. Dolazoline\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nTamsulosin and Prazosin are both alpha-1 adrenergic blockers that provide symptomatic relief in benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) by relaxing smooth muscle in the prostate, thereby improving urine flow. Tamsulosin is particularly well-known and widely used for this purpose, with a high efficacy rate. Oxazocin, while also an alpha-1 adrenergic blocker, is less commonly used and has a lower efficacy rate for BPH symptom relief. Dolazoline does not have a clear mechanism or established efficacy for BPH symptom relief, making it an unsuitable choice. The retrieved evidence path, while broad, supports the understanding that improved urine flow is associated with symptom relief in BPH, aligning with the mechanism of action of alpha-1 adrenergic blockers like Tamsulosin and Prazosin.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The core medical principle here is the use of alpha-1 adrenergic blockers to provide symptomatic relief in benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) by relaxing the smooth muscle in the prostate and bladder neck, which improves urine flow. Among the options provided, Tamsulosin (opa) and Prazosin (opb) are both known to be effective alpha-1 adrenergic blockers for this purpose. However, Tamsulosin is particularly well-known and widely used specifically for BPH due to its selectivity for alpha-1A adrenergic receptors, which are predominantly found in the prostate. This selectivity reduces the risk of systemic side effects compared to non-selective alpha blockers like Prazosin. Oxazocin (opc) is less commonly used and not well-documented for BPH, and Dolazoline (opd) does not have an established role in BPH treatment. Therefore, based on standard medical knowledge and consensus, Tamsulosin is the most likely correct answer.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
