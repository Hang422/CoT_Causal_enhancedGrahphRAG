Abciximab\nopb. Eptifibatide\nopc. Tirofiban\nopd. Prasugrel\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nGp2b3A inhibitors are a class of antiplatelet drugs that include Abciximab, Eptifibatide, and Tirofiban. These drugs work by inhibiting the glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor on platelets, preventing platelet aggregation. Prasugrel, on the other hand, is an antiplatelet agent that functions as a P2Y12 receptor inhibitor, not a Gp2b3A inhibitor. The retrieved evidence path supports this by associating Prasugrel with P2Y12 interaction, confirming it is not a Gp2b3A inhibitor. Therefore, the correct answer is that Prasugrel is not a Gp2b3A inhibitor.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

The drugs Abciximab, Eptifibatide, and Tirofiban are well-known members of this class. Prasugrel, however, is not a Gp2b3A inhibitor; it is a P2Y12 receptor inhibitor, which works through a different mechanism to prevent platelet aggregation. This distinction is well-established in pharmacology, and there is a clear consensus that Prasugrel does not belong to the Gp2b3A inhibitor class.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 100\n}\n```",
