Vitamin A\nopb. Vitamin B\nopc. Vitamin C\nopd. Vitamin E\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nNyctalopia, or night blindness, is primarily due to a deficiency in Vitamin A. This is because Vitamin A is essential for the formation of rhodopsin, a visual pigment in the retina necessary for low-light vision. The reasoning chains correctly identify Vitamin A deficiency as the cause of nyctalopia, aligning with the consensus that Vitamin A is crucial for retinal health and function. The retrieved evidence paths support this by linking malnutrition and night blindness to Vitamin A deficiency, reinforcing the role of Vitamin A in preventing night vision impairment. Other vitamins, such as B, C, and E, are not directly associated with nyctalopia, making Vitamin A the correct answer.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "
