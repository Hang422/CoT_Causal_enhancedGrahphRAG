Cough suppression\nopb. Anti-emesis\nopc. Miosis\nopd. Truncal rigidity\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nOpioids are known to have several pharmacological actions. Cough suppression is a well-documented effect of opioids, as they act on the central nervous system to reduce the cough reflex. Miosis, or pupil constriction, is another common effect due to opioid action on the parasympathetic nervous system. Truncal rigidity, characterized by muscle stiffness, is also a recognized effect, particularly with high doses or certain opioid types. However, anti-emesis is not a typical action of opioids; in fact, opioids often cause nausea and vomiting as side effects. Therefore, anti-emesis is not a pharmacological action of opioids, aligning with the consensus that opioids are more likely to induce rather than prevent emesis.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "
