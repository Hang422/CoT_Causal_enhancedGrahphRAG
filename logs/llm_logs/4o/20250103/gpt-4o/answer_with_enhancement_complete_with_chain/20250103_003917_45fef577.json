Propanolol\nopb. Aiprazolam\nopc. Buspirone\nopd. Haloperidol\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nPropranolol is a beta-blocker that can be used off-label for anxiety, particularly for physical symptoms like tremors and palpitations, but it is not primarily an anxiolytic. Alprazolam is a benzodiazepine, widely recognized and used for treating anxiety disorders. Buspirone is an anxiolytic specifically used for managing anxiety. Haloperidol is an antipsychotic and is not typically used for anxiety treatment. The evidence paths confirm that benzodiazepines treat anxiety, supporting Alprazolam's use. The path indicating antipsychotics treat anxiety is misleading for Haloperidol, as it is not a standard treatment for anxiety. Therefore, Haloperidol is the drug not typically used for anxiety.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"To determine which drug is not used for anxiety, we need to consider the primary indications and common off-label uses of each option. Propranolol, while primarily a beta-blocker for cardiovascular conditions, is often used off-label to manage physical symptoms of anxiety, such as tremors and palpitations. Alprazolam is a benzodiazepine, widely recognized and used for treating anxiety disorders. Buspirone is an anxiolytic specifically indicated for managing anxiety. Haloperidol, on the other hand, is an antipsychotic primarily used for treating schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders. It is not typically used for anxiety treatment.
