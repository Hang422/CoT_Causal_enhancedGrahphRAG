Bromocriptine\nopb. Levodopa\nopc. Amantadine\nopd. Metoclopramide\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nHyperprolactinemia is a side effect of metoclopramide. Metoclopramide acts as a dopamine receptor antagonist, which leads to increased prolactin secretion and can result in hyperprolactinemia. This is supported by evidence paths showing metoclopramide's association with dopamine receptor blockade. In contrast, bromocriptine is a dopamine agonist, levodopa is a dopamine precursor, and amantadine stimulates dopamine release; all these actions increase dopamine levels, which typically decrease prolactin secretion, making hyperprolactinemia unlikely with these drugs.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Hyperprolactinemia is a condition characterized by elevated levels of prolactin in the blood. It is commonly associated with medications that antagonize dopamine receptors, as dopamine normally inhibits prolactin secretion. Metoclopramide is a dopamine receptor antagonist, which can lead to increased prolactin levels and result in hyperprolactinemia. In contrast, bromocriptine is a dopamine agonist, levodopa is a precursor to dopamine, and amantadine promotes dopamine release, all of which would typically decrease prolactin levels. Therefore, based on the pharmacological actions of these drugs, metoclopramide is the most likely to cause hyperprolactinemia.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
