      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in the field of Physiology.\n                    You are a medical expert determining the final answer.\n\n            ### Instructions:\n            - Use standard medical knowledge as the primary guide.\n            - Consider enhanced information only if it aligns with consensus.\n            - If conflicting or unclear, present the most likely correct answer based on known facts.\n            - It's acceptable to show moderate confidence if the question is complex, but still choose one best answer.\n\n\n                    ### Question\n                    In circulatory biomechanics which of the following is true?\n\n                    ### Options\n                    opa. Blood viscosity is increased in anemia\nopb. Blood viscosity is decreased in polycythemia\nopc. Cardiac output is increased in anemia\nopd. Cardiac output is decreased in Beri-Beri\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nIn circulatory biomechanics, the following consensus-aligned facts are relevant: 1) In anemia, there is a decrease in red blood cells, leading to decreased blood viscosity, which is consistent with the reasoning chain for option opa. 2) In polycythemia, there is an increase in red blood cells, leading to increased blood viscosity, contradicting the reasoning chain for option opb. 3) Anemia results in decreased oxygen delivery, which typically causes an increase in cardiac output to compensate, aligning with the reasoning chain for option opc. 4) Beri-Beri, caused by thiamine deficiency, leads to impaired energy metabolism and vasodilation, which generally results in increased cardiac output, contradicting the reasoning chain for option opd. The retrieved evidence paths, while broad, support the relationship between erythrocytes, hemoglobin, and blood viscosity, confirming the consensus understanding of blood viscosity changes in anemia and polycythemia.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"In circulatory biomechanics, blood viscosity and cardiac output are influenced by various physiological conditions. In anemia, there is a reduction in red blood cells, leading to decreased blood viscosity, which contradicts option opa. In polycythemia, the increase in red blood cells results in increased blood viscosity, contradicting option opb. Anemia causes decreased oxygen delivery, prompting the body to increase cardiac output to maintain adequate tissue oxygenation, supporting option opc. Beri-Beri, due to thiamine deficiency, typically results in vasodilation and increased cardiac output, contradicting option opd. Therefore, the most likely correct statement is that cardiac output is increased in anemia to compensate for reduced oxygen-carrying capacity.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opc\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
