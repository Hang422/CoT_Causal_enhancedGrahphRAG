Anti depressants\nopb. Anti psychotics\nopc. Anti epileptics\nopd. Mood stabilizers\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nSchizophrenia is primarily treated with antipsychotics, which target dopamine dysregulation and are effective in reducing positive symptoms such as hallucinations and delusions. Antipsychotics may also help with negative and cognitive symptoms, though to a lesser extent. Antidepressants are not the primary treatment for schizophrenia but may be used adjunctively to address comorbid depression. Antiepileptics and mood stabilizers are not standard treatments for schizophrenia but may be considered in specific cases for mood stabilization. The evidence paths confirm the association of antipsychotics with schizophrenia treatment, while the links to antidepressants, antiepileptics, and mood stabilizers suggest potential but not primary roles in management.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Schizophrenia is a complex psychiatric disorder primarily characterized by positive symptoms such as hallucinations and delusions, as well as negative symptoms and cognitive impairments. The mainstay of treatment for schizophrenia is antipsychotic medications, which primarily target dopamine dysregulation in the brain. These medications are effective in reducing positive symptoms and can also have some effect on negative and cognitive symptoms. While antidepressants, antiepileptics, and mood stabilizers may be used in certain cases to address specific symptoms or comorbid conditions, they are not the primary treatment for schizophrenia. Therefore, based on standard medical knowledge and consensus, antipsychotics are the most appropriate and effective treatment for schizophrenia.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
