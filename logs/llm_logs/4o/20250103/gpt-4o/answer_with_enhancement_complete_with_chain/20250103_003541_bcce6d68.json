Nimodipine\nopb. Amlodipine\nopc. Diltiazem\nopd. Verapamil\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nNimodipine is a calcium channel blocker specifically indicated for the treatment of subarachnoid hemorrhage due to its ability to cause vasodilation and reduce cerebral vasospasm, which improves outcomes in this condition. This aligns with the consensus that nimodipine is used to prevent cerebral vasospasm following subarachnoid hemorrhage. The evidence path supports this by showing nimodipine's interaction with calcium channel blockers and its role in vasodilation. In contrast, amlodipine, diltiazem, and verapamil, while also calcium channel blockers, primarily cause systemic vasodilation and lower blood pressure, and are not specifically indicated for cerebral vasospasm in subarachnoid hemorrhage. The retrieved evidence paths confirm their classification as calcium channel blockers but do not provide specific support for their use in subarachnoid hemorrhage, aligning with the consensus that they are not the preferred treatment in this context.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"In the context of subarachnoid hemorrhage, the primary concern is the prevention of cerebral vasospasm, which can lead to delayed cerebral ischemia. Nimodipine, a calcium channel blocker, is specifically indicated for this purpose due to its ability to selectively dilate cerebral blood vessels and reduce the risk of vasospasm. This is supported by clinical guidelines and consensus in the medical community. Other calcium channel blockers like amlodipine, diltiazem, and verapamil are not specifically indicated for subarachnoid hemorrhage as they primarily affect systemic blood pressure and do not have the same targeted effect on cerebral vasospasm. Therefore, based on standard medical knowledge and consensus, nimodipine is the most appropriate choice for this condition.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
