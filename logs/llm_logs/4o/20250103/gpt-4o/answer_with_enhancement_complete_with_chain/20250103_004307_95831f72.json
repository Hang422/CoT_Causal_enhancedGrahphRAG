Vitamin A\nopb. Vitamin B6\nopc. Vitamin B9\nopd. Vitamin B12\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nSubacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord is a well-established feature of Vitamin B12 deficiency. This condition arises due to impaired myelin synthesis and accumulation of methylmalonic acid, both of which contribute to neurotoxicity and demyelination of the spinal cord. The retrieved evidence path supports this by linking Vitamin B12 deficiency to neurological symptoms, which aligns with the consensus that Vitamin B12 deficiency leads to subacute combined degeneration. Other vitamins listed, such as Vitamin A, B6, and B9, are not associated with this specific condition.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "
