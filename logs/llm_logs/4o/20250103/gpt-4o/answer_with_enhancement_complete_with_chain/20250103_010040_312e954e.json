Penicillin\nopb. Cotrimoxazole\nopc. Kanamycin\nopd. Levofloxacin\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nPneumocystis pneumonia, caused by Pneumocystis jirovecii (formerly known as P. carinii), is an opportunistic infection commonly seen in immunocompromised patients, such as those with HIV/AIDS. The standard treatment and prophylaxis for this type of pneumonia is Cotrimoxazole (Trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole), which is effective against P. jirovecii. Penicillin is ineffective as it targets bacterial infections, whereas P. jirovecii is a fungal organism. Kanamycin and Levofloxacin are not effective or recommended for P. jirovecii pneumonia, as they do not target this organism. The retrieved evidence paths, while broad, confirm interactions between pharmaceutical preparations and Trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole, supporting its use in treating P. jirovecii pneumonia. Therefore, Cotrimoxazole is the drug of choice for pneumonia caused by P. jirovecii.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

The standard treatment for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia is Cotrimoxazole (Trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole), which is effective in both treatment and prophylaxis of this infection.
