Strongyloidiasis\nopb. Trichomoniasis\nopc. Schistosomiasis\nopd. Rhinosporidiosis\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nPraziquantel is an antiparasitic medication primarily effective against trematodes, making it the treatment of choice for Schistosomiasis. It is not effective against protozoa, fungi, or nematodes, and therefore is not used for the treatment of Trichomoniasis, Rhinosporidiosis, or Strongyloidiasis. The retrieved evidence path associating Praziquantel with a fungus is irrelevant to its known use and should be disregarded. The consensus supports Praziquantel's use specifically for Schistosomiasis.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "
