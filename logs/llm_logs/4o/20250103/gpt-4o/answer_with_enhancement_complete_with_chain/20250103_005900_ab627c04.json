Allopurinol\nopb. Probenecid\nopc. Indomethacin\nopd. Aspirin\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nProbenecid is a uricosuric drug as it increases the renal excretion of uric acid, thereby reducing serum uric acid levels. This aligns with the consensus that uricosuric drugs promote the excretion of uric acid in the urine. Allopurinol, while used in the management of gout, is not primarily uricosuric; it works by inhibiting xanthine oxidase to decrease uric acid production. Indomethacin is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug and does not have uricosuric properties. Aspirin has a complex effect on uric acid excretion: low doses can decrease excretion, while high doses may increase it, but it is not consistently used as a uricosuric agent. Therefore, Probenecid is the correct answer as the uricosuric drug.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The question asks for an uricosuric drug, which is a type of medication that increases the excretion of uric acid in the urine. Among the options provided, Probenecid is well-known for its uricosuric properties, as it enhances the renal clearance of uric acid, thereby lowering serum uric acid levels. Allopurinol, although used in gout management, functions by inhibiting xanthine oxidase to reduce uric acid production, not by increasing its excretion. Indomethacin is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) and does not have uricosuric effects. Aspirin has a dose-dependent effect on uric acid excretion, but it is not primarily used as a uricosuric agent. Therefore, based on standard medical knowledge and consensus, Probenecid is the most likely correct answer as the uricosuric drug.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
