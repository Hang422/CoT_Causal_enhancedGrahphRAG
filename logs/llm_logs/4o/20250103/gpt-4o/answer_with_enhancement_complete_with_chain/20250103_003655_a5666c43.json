Proximal tubule\nopb. Distal tubules\nopc. Loop of Henle\nopd. Collecting duct\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nAldosterone primarily acts on the distal tubules and the collecting duct of the nephron. It promotes sodium reabsorption and potassium excretion, which are key functions in these segments. The evidence path indicating aldosterone's role in body fluid retention supports its action in these areas, as sodium reabsorption leads to water retention. The proximal tubule and loop of Henle are not primary sites of aldosterone action, as consensus indicates its effects are most significant in the distal tubules and collecting duct.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Aldosterone is a hormone that plays a crucial role in regulating sodium and potassium balance in the body. It primarily acts on the distal tubules and the collecting duct of the nephron. In these segments, aldosterone promotes sodium reabsorption and potassium excretion, which are essential for maintaining fluid balance and blood pressure. The proximal tubule and the loop of Henle are not the primary sites of aldosterone action. The enhanced information aligns with the standard medical consensus that aldosterone's effects are most significant in the distal tubules and collecting duct. Therefore, the most likely correct answer is that aldosterone acts on the distal tubules and the collecting duct.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
