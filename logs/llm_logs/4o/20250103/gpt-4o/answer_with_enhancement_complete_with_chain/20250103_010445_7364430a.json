Leucine\nopb. Lysine\nopc. Methionine\nopd. Proline\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nEssential amino acids are those that cannot be synthesized by the human body and must be obtained from the diet. Leucine, lysine, and methionine are all essential amino acids, as they are required for protein synthesis, growth, tissue repair, and various metabolic processes, including methylation. Proline, on the other hand, is a non-essential amino acid because the body can synthesize it. The evidence paths, while broad, confirm the interaction of leucine and lysine with cellular processes, supporting their roles as essential amino acids. Therefore, the correct answer is that proline is not an essential amino acid.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

Leucine, lysine, and methionine are well-established as essential amino acids due to their critical roles in protein synthesis and metabolic processes. Proline, however, is classified as a non-essential amino acid because the body can produce it from other compounds.
