Thiamine\nopb. Pyridoxine\nopc. Niacin\nopd. Riboflavin\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nINH (isoniazid) is known to interfere with pyridoxine (vitamin B6) metabolism, leading to pyridoxine deficiency, which can cause peripheral neuropathy. The standard treatment for INH-induced neuropathy is supplementation with pyridoxine. All reasoning chains correctly identify pyridoxine as the treatment, aligning with medical consensus. The retrieved evidence paths support this by indicating that pyridoxine treats neuropathy and that isoniazid is associated with pyridoxine metabolism issues. Therefore, the correct treatment for INH-induced neuropathy is pyridoxine supplementation.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

It is known to interfere with the metabolism of pyridoxine (vitamin B6), leading to a deficiency that can result in peripheral neuropathy. The standard medical treatment for INH-induced neuropathy is supplementation with pyridoxine. This is because pyridoxine supplementation can prevent or reverse the neuropathy caused by isoniazid. The enhanced information supports this consensus, indicating that pyridoxine is the correct treatment for INH-induced neuropathy. Other options such as thiamine, niacin, and riboflavin are not relevant to the specific mechanism of INH-induced neuropathy.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 100\n}\n```",
