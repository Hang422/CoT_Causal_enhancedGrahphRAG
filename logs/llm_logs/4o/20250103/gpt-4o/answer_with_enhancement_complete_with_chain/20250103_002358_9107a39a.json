Morphine patch\nopb. Diazepam\nopc. Clobazam\nopd. Haloperidol\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nIn the palliation of dyspnoea in a lung cancer patient, the use of a morphine patch is supported by consensus as it binds to opioid receptors, reducing the perception of breathlessness. This aligns with evidence showing morphine's role in treating conditions associated with opioid receptor activity. Diazepam, while having a sedative effect that can reduce anxiety, is less directly effective for dyspnoea palliation, as its primary action is not on the respiratory system. Clobazam, another benzodiazepine, similarly may reduce anxiety but is not primarily indicated for dyspnoea. Haloperidol, an antipsychotic, may provide sedation but is not typically used for dyspnoea palliation. Therefore, the morphine patch is the most consensus-supported option for effectively alleviating dyspnoea in this context.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"In the management of dyspnoea in lung cancer patients, opioids like morphine are commonly used due to their ability to reduce the sensation of breathlessness by acting on opioid receptors. This is a well-established practice in palliative care. While benzodiazepines such as diazepam and clobazam can help alleviate anxiety, they do not directly address the sensation of dyspnoea. Haloperidol, an antipsychotic, is not typically used for this purpose. The morphine patch is specifically indicated for the palliation of dyspnoea in cancer patients, making it the most appropriate choice based on medical consensus.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
