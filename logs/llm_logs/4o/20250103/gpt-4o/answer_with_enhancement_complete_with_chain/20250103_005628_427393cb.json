Succinylcholine\nopb. Tubocurare\nopc. Pyridostigmine\nopd. Halothane\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nIn patients with myasthenia gravis, the use of neuromuscular blockers is critical to consider due to their effects on muscle strength. Succinylcholine, a depolarizing neuromuscular blocker, can exacerbate muscle weakness and is contraindicated in myasthenia gravis. This aligns with the consensus that depolarizing agents can worsen the condition. Tubocurare, a non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocker, also increases muscle weakness and is generally avoided in myasthenia gravis, but it is not as strongly contraindicated as succinylcholine. Pyridostigmine, an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, improves neuromuscular transmission and is used to treat myasthenia gravis, thus not contraindicated. Halothane, a general anesthetic, does not directly affect the neuromuscular junction and is not contraindicated in myasthenia gravis. The evidence paths confirm the interactions of succinylcholine with acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, supporting its contraindication due to potential exacerbation of muscle weakness.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "
