Tolazoline\nopb. Clonidine\nopc. Bismuth\nopd. Oxymetazoline\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nTolazoline is a vasodilator used in diagnostic tests for pulmonary hypertension due to its ability to increase blood flow, aligning with the consensus that it can be used to assess pulmonary vascular reactivity. The evidence paths support its role in vasodilation, which is relevant to its use in such tests. Clonidine, an alpha-2 adrenergic agonist, is used in diagnostic tests for pheochromocytoma due to its effect on reducing sympathetic outflow and blood pressure, which is consistent with standard medical practice. Bismuth is primarily used for gastrointestinal protection and ulcer treatment, not typically in diagnostic tests, which aligns with consensus. Oxymetazoline is a vasoconstrictor used for reducing nasal congestion and is not typically used in diagnostic tests, consistent with standard medical understanding. Therefore, Tolazoline is the drug used in the diagnostic test for pulmonary hypertension.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The question asks which drug is used in a specific diagnostic test. Based on standard medical knowledge, Tolazoline is known to be used in diagnostic tests for pulmonary hypertension due to its vasodilatory effects, which help assess pulmonary vascular reactivity. Clonidine is used in tests for pheochromocytoma, Bismuth is used for gastrointestinal issues, and Oxymetazoline is a nasal decongestant. Given the context and the enhanced information, Tolazoline is the most likely drug used in a diagnostic test related to pulmonary hypertension. This aligns with the consensus that Tolazoline's vasodilatory properties are useful in such tests.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}\n```",
