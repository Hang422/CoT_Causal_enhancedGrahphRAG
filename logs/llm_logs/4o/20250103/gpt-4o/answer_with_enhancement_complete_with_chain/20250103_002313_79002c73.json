Bromocriptine\nopb. Haloperidol\nopc. Reserpine\nopd. Chlorpromazine\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nBromocriptine is a dopamine agonist, which inhibits prolactin release, and therefore does not cause hyperprolactinemia. This aligns with the evidence path showing its interaction with dopamine. Haloperidol and Chlorpromazine are dopamine antagonists, which increase prolactin release and cause hyperprolactinemia, supported by their interactions with dopamine antagonists. Reserpine depletes monoamines, which can lead to increased prolactin levels and possible hyperprolactinemia, though this effect is less direct compared to dopamine antagonists. Therefore, Bromocriptine is the drug that does not cause hyperprolactinemia.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The core medical principle here involves understanding the effects of different drugs on prolactin levels. Bromocriptine is a dopamine agonist, which means it stimulates dopamine receptors. Dopamine inhibits prolactin release, so bromocriptine actually reduces prolactin levels and does not cause hyperprolactinemia. On the other hand, Haloperidol and Chlorpromazine are dopamine antagonists, which block dopamine receptors and lead to increased prolactin release, causing hyperprolactinemia. Reserpine works by depleting monoamines, including dopamine, which can indirectly lead to increased prolactin levels, although this effect is less direct than with dopamine antagonists. Therefore, based on the pharmacological actions of these drugs, Bromocriptine is the one that does not cause hyperprolactinemia.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
