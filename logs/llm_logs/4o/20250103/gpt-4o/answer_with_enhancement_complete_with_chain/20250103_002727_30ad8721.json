Imiquimod\nopb. Podophylline\nopc. Interferon\nopd. Acyclovir\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nImiquimod is a topical immunomodulator that activates the immune response and is used for the treatment of genital warts, aligning with standard medical consensus. The evidence path supports its role in treating conditions associated with immune response modulation. Podophylline is also used topically for genital warts but works through a cytotoxic mechanism, not as an immunomodulator. Interferon modulates the immune response and can be used for genital warts, but it is not typically a first-line topical treatment. Acyclovir is an antiviral used for herpes simplex virus infections and is not used for genital warts. Therefore, Imiquimod is the most appropriate choice for a topical immunomodulator used in the treatment of genital warts.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"The question asks for a topical immunomodulator used in the treatment of genital warts. Imiquimod is a well-known topical immunomodulator that works by activating the immune system to fight against the human papillomavirus (HPV) that causes genital warts. Podophylline is also used for genital warts but acts through a cytotoxic mechanism, not as an immunomodulator. Interferon is an immunomodulator but is not typically used topically as a first-line treatment for genital warts. Acyclovir is an antiviral medication used for herpes simplex virus infections, not for genital warts. Based on standard medical knowledge and consensus, Imiquimod is the most appropriate choice for a topical immunomodulator used in the treatment of genital warts.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
