PAS\nopb. Ethionamide\nopc. Cycloserine\nopd. Pyrazinamide\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nEthionamide is known to inhibit thyroid hormone synthesis, which can lead to reduced thyroid hormone levels and potentially cause hypothyroidism. This aligns with the consensus that ethionamide can cause hypothyroidism. PAS (p-Aminosalicylic Acid) has a possible but unclear impact on thyroid function, and there is no strong evidence linking it directly to hypothyroidism. Cycloserine and Pyrazinamide have no known effects on thyroid function and are unlikely to cause hypothyroidism. The retrieved evidence paths do not provide direct support for any of the options causing hypothyroidism, but they do not contradict the consensus that ethionamide is the most likely to cause this condition.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "
