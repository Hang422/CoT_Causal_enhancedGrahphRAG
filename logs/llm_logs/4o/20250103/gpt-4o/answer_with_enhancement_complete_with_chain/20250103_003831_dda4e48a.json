Produced by alpha cells of pancreas\nopb. Two polypeptide chains are bound by disulfide linkages\nopc. Shifts potassium outside the cell\nopd. S.c insulin tl/2 is 60 mins\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nInsulin is produced by the beta cells of the pancreas, not the alpha cells, which produce glucagon. Insulin consists of two polypeptide chains (A and B) that are connected by disulfide linkages, which is a true statement. Insulin facilitates the movement of potassium into cells, not outside, which contradicts the option suggesting otherwise. The half-life of subcutaneous insulin is approximately 5-10 minutes, not 60 minutes. The retrieved evidence paths broadly confirm insulin's role in energy metabolism and its association with the pancreas but do not directly address the specific options. Therefore, the correct statement regarding insulin is that it consists of two polypeptide chains bound by disulfide linkages.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"To determine the true statement regarding insulin, we first consider the production site: insulin is produced by the beta cells of the pancreas, not the alpha cells, which rules out option opa. Insulin is composed of two polypeptide chains (A and B) connected by disulfide linkages, making option opb correct. Insulin's role in potassium regulation involves moving potassium into cells, not outside, which makes option opc incorrect. The half-life of subcutaneous insulin is approximately 5-10 minutes, not 60 minutes, which makes option opd incorrect. Therefore, the most accurate statement based on standard medical knowledge is that insulin consists of two polypeptide chains bound by disulfide linkages.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
