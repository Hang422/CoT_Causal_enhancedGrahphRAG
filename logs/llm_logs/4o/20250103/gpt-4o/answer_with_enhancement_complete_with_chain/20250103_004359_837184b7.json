ENL\nopb. HIV neuropathy\nopc. HIV associated ulcer\nopd. Behcet's syndrome\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nThalidomide is well-established for use in ENL (erythema nodosum leprosum) due to its anti-inflammatory effects, and it is also used in Behcet's syndrome for its immunomodulatory properties. However, thalidomide is not typically used for HIV neuropathy, as there is a lack of evidence supporting its efficacy in this condition. While there is some exploration of thalidomide's use in HIV-associated ulcers, its efficacy remains unclear and not well-supported by consensus. Therefore, the option where thalidomide is not used is HIV neuropathy.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "
