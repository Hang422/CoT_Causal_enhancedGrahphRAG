Can be used in absence seizures\nopb. Can be mixed with saline\nopc. Can be given orally\nopd. It is the drug of choice for myoclonic seizures\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nFosphenytoin is a water-soluble prodrug of phenytoin, which allows it to be mixed with saline for intravenous or intramuscular administration, unlike phenytoin which is not water-soluble. This aligns with the consensus that fosphenytoin can be mixed with saline (Option B). Fosphenytoin, like phenytoin, is not effective for absence seizures and is not the drug of choice for myoclonic seizures, confirming that Options A and D are incorrect. Additionally, fosphenytoin is not administered orally, as it is designed for parenteral use, supporting the reasoning that Option C is incorrect. The retrieved evidence paths, while broad, confirm that fosphenytoin is used in the treatment of seizures, but do not provide specific insights into the differences between fosphenytoin and phenytoin regarding the options presented.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Fosphenytoin is a prodrug of phenytoin that is water-soluble, allowing it to be mixed with saline for intravenous or intramuscular administration. This is a key difference from phenytoin, which is not water-soluble and cannot be mixed with saline. Fosphenytoin is not effective for absence seizures, is not administered orally, and is not the drug of choice for myoclonic seizures, similar to phenytoin. Therefore, the primary distinction between fosphenytoin and phenytoin in the context of the options provided is its ability to be mixed with saline for administration.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
