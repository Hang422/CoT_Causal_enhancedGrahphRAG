Cholestyramine\nopb. Thiazide diuretics\nopc. Quinidine\nopd. Amlodipine\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nCholestyramine binds to digoxin in the gut, leading to decreased absorption and a significant drug interaction, as supported by its interaction with digoxin. Thiazide diuretics can cause hypokalemia, increasing the risk of digoxin toxicity, which is a significant interaction. Quinidine inhibits P-glycoprotein, resulting in increased digoxin levels and a significant interaction, confirmed by its interaction with P-glycoproteins. Amlodipine, a calcium channel blocker, does not significantly affect digoxin levels, and thus does not have a significant drug interaction with digoxin, as supported by its classification and interaction with calcium channel blockers. Therefore, the drug that does not have a significant interaction with digoxin is amlodipine.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Digoxin is known to have significant interactions with several drugs due to its narrow therapeutic index and its dependence on renal excretion and P-glycoprotein for clearance. Cholestyramine can bind to digoxin in the gastrointestinal tract, reducing its absorption and thus interacting significantly. Thiazide diuretics can lead to hypokalemia, which increases the risk of digoxin toxicity, making this a significant interaction. Quinidine inhibits P-glycoprotein, leading to increased serum levels of digoxin, which is a well-documented significant interaction. Amlodipine, on the other hand, is a calcium channel blocker that does not significantly alter digoxin levels or its pharmacokinetics, and thus does not have a significant interaction with digoxin. Based on standard pharmacological knowledge and the enhanced information provided, amlodipine is the drug that does not have a significant interaction with digoxin.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opd\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
