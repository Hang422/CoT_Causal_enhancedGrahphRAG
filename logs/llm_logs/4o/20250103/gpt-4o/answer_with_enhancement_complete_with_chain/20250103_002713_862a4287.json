Anti depressants\nopb. Anti psychotics\nopc. Anti epileptics\nopd. Mood stabilizers\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nSchizophrenia is primarily treated with antipsychotics, which are effective due to their ability to block dopamine receptors, addressing the dopamine dysregulation associated with the disorder. This aligns with the consensus that antipsychotics are the mainstay treatment for managing positive symptoms like hallucinations and delusions, and they may also help with negative and cognitive symptoms. The evidence paths support the association between schizophrenia and antipsychotic agents, confirming their role in symptom control. Antidepressants, while not primary treatments, may be used for comorbid depression in schizophrenia, as supported by evidence paths linking them to neurobehavioral manifestations. Antiepileptics and mood stabilizers are not standard treatments for schizophrenia but may be considered for mood stabilization in specific cases, though this is not their primary use. The evidence paths do not provide strong support for these options as primary treatments for schizophrenia.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "
