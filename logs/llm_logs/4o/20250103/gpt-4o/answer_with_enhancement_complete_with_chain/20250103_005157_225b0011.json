Better glucose tolerance\nopb. Muscle cramps\nopc. Decrease in urea level\nopd. Hypokalemia\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nTriamterene is a potassium-sparing diuretic, which means it helps retain potassium in the body, potentially leading to hyperkalemia rather than hypokalemia. Therefore, option 'opd' (Hypokalemia) is incorrect. The retention of potassium can sometimes lead to muscle cramps, supporting option 'opb' (Muscle cramps) as a plausible effect. Triamterene does not have a direct effect on glucose metabolism, making it unlikely to improve glucose tolerance, thus option 'opa' (Better glucose tolerance) is not supported. While diuretics can affect urea levels, triamterene's primary action is on potassium retention, and there is no strong consensus or evidence to suggest it significantly decreases urea levels, making option 'opc' (Decrease in urea level) less likely. The retrieved evidence paths confirm triamterene's role in potassium retention and its association with hyperkalemia, aligning with the consensus that muscle cramps can occur due to electrolyte imbalances.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "
