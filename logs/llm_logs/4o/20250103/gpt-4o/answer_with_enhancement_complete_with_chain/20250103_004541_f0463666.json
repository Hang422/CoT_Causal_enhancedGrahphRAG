      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in the field of Biochemistry.\n                    You are a medical expert determining the final answer.\n\n            ### Instructions:\n            - Use standard medical knowledge as the primary guide.\n            - Consider enhanced information only if it aligns with consensus.\n            - If conflicting or unclear, present the most likely correct answer based on known facts.\n            - It's acceptable to show moderate confidence if the question is complex, but still choose one best answer.\n\n\n                    ### Question\n                    Starvation and diabetes mellitus can lead on to ketoacidosis which of the following features is in our of ketoacidosis due to diabetes mellitus.\n\n                    ### Options\n                    opa. Increase in glucagon/insulin ratio, increased CAMP and increased blood glucose\nopb. Decreased insulin, increased free fatty acid which is equivalent to blood glucose\nopc. Decreased insulin, increased free fatty acid which is not equivalent to blood glucose\nopd. Elevated insulin and free fatty acid, equivalent to blood glucose\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nIn ketoacidosis due to diabetes mellitus, the key feature is a decreased insulin level, leading to an increased glucagon/insulin ratio. This results in increased cAMP levels and elevated blood glucose, as the body shifts to using free fatty acids for energy due to lack of insulin. This aligns with option 'opa', which correctly describes the biochemical changes: increased glucagon/insulin ratio, increased cAMP, and increased blood glucose. The evidence path indicating interaction between nonesterified fatty acids and blood glucose supports the metabolic shift towards fatty acid utilization, but it is not directly equivalent to blood glucose levels. Therefore, option 'opc' is partially correct in noting that increased free fatty acids are not equivalent to blood glucose. Options 'opb' and 'opd' are incorrect as they either misrepresent the relationship between free fatty acids and blood glucose or incorrectly state insulin levels. The consensus supports 'opa' as the most accurate description of ketoacidosis in diabetes mellitus.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

Option 'opc' is partially correct in noting that increased free fatty acids are not equivalent to blood glucose, but it does not fully capture the key features of diabetic ketoacidosis.
