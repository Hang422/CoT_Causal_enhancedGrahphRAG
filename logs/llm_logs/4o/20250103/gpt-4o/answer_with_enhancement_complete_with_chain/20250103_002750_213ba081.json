Stomach\nopb. Duodenum\nopc. Ileum\nopd. Duodenum + Jejunum\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nIron is primarily absorbed in the duodenum, which is the major site for iron absorption in the human body. This is supported by the consensus that the duodenum is the primary location for iron uptake due to its physiological role in nutrient absorption. While there is some absorption in the jejunum, it is not significant enough to consider it a primary site. The stomach is not a primary site for iron absorption, as its role is more related to the initial digestion and solubilization of iron. The ileum is also not a primary site for iron absorption. The retrieved evidence paths, while broad, support the physiological role of the duodenum in iron absorption, aligning with the consensus that the duodenum is the key site for this process.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Iron absorption primarily occurs in the duodenum, which is the first part of the small intestine immediately following the stomach. This is due to the duodenum's role in nutrient absorption and its ability to handle the acidic chyme from the stomach, which aids in the solubilization and uptake of iron. While some iron absorption can occur in the jejunum, it is not significant enough to be considered a primary site. The stomach's role is more about preparing iron for absorption rather than absorbing it, and the ileum is not involved in significant iron absorption. Therefore, based on standard medical knowledge and consensus, the duodenum is the primary site for iron absorption.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
