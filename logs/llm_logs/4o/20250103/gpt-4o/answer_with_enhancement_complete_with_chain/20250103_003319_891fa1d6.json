Morphine\nopb. Dextromethorphan\nopc. Diphenhydramine\nopd. Aprepitant\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nDextromethorphan is known to cause hallucinations due to its action as an NMDA receptor antagonist, which alters neurotransmission. This is supported by evidence linking dextromethorphan to NMDA receptor interactions. Morphine, while primarily an opioid receptor agonist, can also cause central nervous system effects, including possible hallucinations, but this is less common compared to dextromethorphan. Diphenhydramine, an antihistamine with anticholinergic properties, can cause central nervous system effects such as hallucinations, but this is not its primary action. Aprepitant, a neurokinin-1 receptor antagonist used as an antiemetic, is unlikely to cause hallucinations, as its primary action does not involve pathways typically associated with such effects. Therefore, dextromethorphan is the most likely antitussive to lead to hallucinations.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Dextromethorphan is an antitussive that acts as an NMDA receptor antagonist, which can lead to altered neurotransmission and is known to cause hallucinations, especially at higher doses. This is a well-documented side effect and aligns with the pharmacological action of dextromethorphan. While morphine can also cause hallucinations due to its effects on the central nervous system, it is primarily an opioid analgesic, and hallucinations are not its primary side effect. Diphenhydramine, an antihistamine, can cause central nervous system effects, including hallucinations, but this is less common and not its primary action. Aprepitant is not typically associated with hallucinations. Therefore, based on the pharmacological profile and consensus, dextromethorphan is the most likely antitussive to lead to hallucinations.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
