Duodenum\nopb. Ileum\nopc. Jejunum\nopd. Colon\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nVitamin B12 absorption occurs in the ileum, where it binds to intrinsic factor, a glycoprotein secreted by the stomach's parietal cells. This complex travels through the duodenum and jejunum without being absorbed, reaching the ileum where specific receptors facilitate its uptake. The reasoning chains correctly identify the ileum as the site of absorption, aligning with standard medical consensus. The retrieved evidence paths, while broad, support the role of intrinsic factor in the uptake process occurring in the ileum. Other paths mentioning the duodenum are not directly relevant to the absorption process of Vitamin B12, as absorption does not occur there. Therefore, the correct answer is that Vitamin B12 intrinsic factor absorption occurs in the ileum.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Vitamin B12 absorption is a well-understood physiological process. The intrinsic factor, secreted by the stomach's parietal cells, binds to Vitamin B12, forming a complex that is resistant to digestion in the stomach and small intestine. This complex travels through the duodenum and jejunum without being absorbed. The absorption of Vitamin B12 occurs in the ileum, where specific receptors recognize and facilitate the uptake of the Vitamin B12-intrinsic factor complex. This process is supported by standard medical knowledge and aligns with the enhanced information provided. The other options, including the duodenum, jejunum, and colon, are not involved in the absorption of Vitamin B12, making the ileum the correct answer.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 100\n}",
