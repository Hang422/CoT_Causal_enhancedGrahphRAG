Vitamin B9\nopb. Vitamin B12\nopc. Vitamin B6\nopd. Vitamin B3\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nIsoniazid is known to interfere with pyridoxine (Vitamin B6) metabolism, leading to a deficiency in Vitamin B6. This is due to isoniazid's role as a pyridoxine antagonist and its ability to increase the excretion of pyridoxine. The retrieved evidence paths support this by associating isoniazid with pyridoxine metabolism and Vitamin B6 deficiency. Other vitamins such as B9, B12, and B3 are not typically affected by isoniazid in the same way, making Vitamin B6 deficiency the most likely outcome in patients on isoniazid therapy.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Isoniazid is an antibiotic commonly used in the treatment of tuberculosis. It is well-documented in medical literature that isoniazid can lead to a deficiency in Vitamin B6 (pyridoxine). This occurs because isoniazid acts as a pyridoxine antagonist, interfering with its metabolism and increasing its excretion. This interaction can lead to symptoms of Vitamin B6 deficiency, such as peripheral neuropathy. To prevent this, patients on isoniazid are often co-prescribed Vitamin B6 supplements. Other vitamins like B9, B12, and B3 are not typically affected by isoniazid in the same manner. Therefore, the most likely vitamin deficiency in patients taking isoniazid is Vitamin B6.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opc\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",
