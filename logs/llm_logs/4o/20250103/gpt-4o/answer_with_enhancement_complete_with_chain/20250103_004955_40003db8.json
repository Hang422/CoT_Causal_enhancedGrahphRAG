Heparin sulfate\nopb. Protamine sulfate\nopc. Low molecular weight heparin\nopd. Warfarin\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nFor prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism in patients undergoing cancer surgery, the standard consensus is to use Low Molecular Weight Heparin (LMWH) due to its effectiveness and convenience. LMWH is preferred over unfractionated heparin (Heparin sulfate) because it requires less frequent dosing and monitoring. Warfarin is not ideal for immediate prophylaxis due to its need for regular monitoring and delayed onset of action. Protamine sulfate is not an anticoagulant; it is used to reverse the effects of heparin, making it irrelevant for prophylaxis. The retrieved evidence paths confirm the association of anticoagulation with preventing thrombosis, which supports the use of anticoagulants like LMWH in this context. Therefore, LMWH is the anticoagulant of choice for this scenario.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "
