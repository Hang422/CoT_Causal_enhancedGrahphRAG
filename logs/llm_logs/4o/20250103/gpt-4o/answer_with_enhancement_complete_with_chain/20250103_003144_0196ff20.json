Ototoxicity\nopb. Nephrotoxicity\nopc. Coasting effect\nopd. Pulmonary fibrosis\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nCisplatin is well-documented to cause ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity, as supported by both standard medical consensus and the retrieved evidence paths. Ototoxicity leads to hearing loss, and nephrotoxicity results in kidney damage, both of which are common side effects of Cisplatin. The 'coasting effect,' referring to delayed neuropathy, is less commonly associated with Cisplatin but can occur, though it is not a primary side effect. Pulmonary fibrosis is not a recognized side effect of Cisplatin, and there is no strong evidence or consensus linking Cisplatin to pulmonary fibrosis. Therefore, the side effect not produced by Cisplatin is pulmonary fibrosis.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

The 'coasting effect' refers to a delayed onset of neuropathy, which can occur with some chemotherapy agents, including Cisplatin, though it is not as commonly highlighted as ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity. Pulmonary fibrosis, however, is not a recognized side effect of Cisplatin. This aligns with standard medical knowledge and consensus, which does not associate Cisplatin with pulmonary fibrosis.
