Increases liver glycogenolysis\nopb. Causes broachiolar constriction\nopc. Evokes extrasystoles in the heart\nopd. Produces restlessness and anxiety\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nEpinephrine, when administered intravenously in high doses, is known to increase liver glycogenolysis, leading to elevated blood glucose levels, which aligns with standard pharmacological consensus. It also evokes extrasystoles in the heart due to its stimulatory effects on cardiac beta-1 adrenergic receptors, increasing heart rate. Additionally, epinephrine can produce restlessness and anxiety as a result of heightened sympathetic nervous system activity, supported by evidence linking it to anxiety and hypertensive conditions. However, epinephrine typically causes bronchodilation rather than bronchiolar constriction, as it activates beta-2 adrenergic receptors in the lungs. Therefore, the action of causing bronchiolar constriction contradicts the known effects of epinephrine, making it the correct answer to the question of which action is not associated with high-dose intravenous epinephrine.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Epinephrine, a catecholamine, primarily acts on adrenergic receptors. At high doses, it stimulates both alpha and beta adrenergic receptors. It increases liver glycogenolysis (opa) by stimulating beta-2 receptors, leading to increased blood glucose levels. It can evoke extrasystoles in the heart (opc) due to its action on beta-1 adrenergic receptors, which increase heart rate and contractility. It also produces restlessness and anxiety (opd) as a result of its overall stimulatory effects on the sympathetic nervous system. However, epinephrine typically causes bronchodilation, not bronchiolar constriction, by activating beta-2 adrenergic receptors in the lungs. Therefore, the action of causing bronchiolar constriction (opb) is not consistent with the known pharmacological effects of epinephrine, making it the correct answer.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opb\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
