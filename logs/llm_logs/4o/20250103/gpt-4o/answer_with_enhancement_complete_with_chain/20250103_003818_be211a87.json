Erythromycin\nopb. Benzene hexachloride\nopc. Piperazine\nopd. Thiabendazole\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nScabies is a skin infestation caused by the mite Sarcoptes scabiei. The standard treatment for scabies involves topical scabicides. Erythromycin is an antibiotic effective against bacterial infections, not scabies, and thus is not suitable for this condition. Piperazine and Thiabendazole are anthelmintics used to treat worm infections, not scabies, and are therefore ineffective. Benzene hexachloride, also known as Lindane, is a topical treatment specifically used to kill scabies mites, making it the correct choice for treating scabies. The retrieved evidence paths, while correct, do not directly address scabies treatment and are not relevant to the decision-making process for this question.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "
