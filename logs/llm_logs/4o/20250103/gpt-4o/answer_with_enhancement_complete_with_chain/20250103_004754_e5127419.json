Hypoglycemia\nopb. Cinchonism\nopc. Arrhythmias\nopd. Sweating\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nThe most likely cause of restlessness and sweating following i.v. quinine administration is hypoglycemia. Quinine can increase insulin secretion, leading to decreased blood glucose levels, which is a well-known cause of hypoglycemia. Hypoglycemia is associated with symptoms such as restlessness and sweating, aligning with the patient's presentation. The evidence path 'hypoglycemia-CAUSES->(Agitation)' supports this reasoning. While cinchonism, arrhythmias, and direct stimulation of sweat glands are potential effects of quinine, they are less likely to explain the combination of restlessness and sweating in this context. Cinchonism typically presents with tinnitus, headache, and dizziness, and arrhythmias are more associated with cardiac symptoms. Direct stimulation of sweat glands by quinine is not a primary mechanism for causing restlessness and sweating together.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "
