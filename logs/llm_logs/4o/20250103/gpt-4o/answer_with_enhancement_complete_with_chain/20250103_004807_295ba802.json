Vitamin A\nopb. Vitamin C\nopc. Vitamin D\nopd. Vitamin B12\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nVitamin D is widely recognized for its role in improving insulin sensitivity, which can reduce insulin resistance and subsequently lower the risk of obesity and metabolic syndrome. This aligns with the consensus that Vitamin D supplementation can have beneficial effects on metabolic health. The evidence path supports this by linking Vitamin D to improved insulin sensitivity, which is a key factor in managing obesity and metabolic syndrome. In contrast, Vitamin A and Vitamin C, while having antioxidant properties, do not have a clear or direct impact on insulin resistance according to current consensus. Vitamin B12 is important for energy metabolism but lacks strong evidence for directly reducing insulin resistance or metabolic syndrome risk. Therefore, Vitamin D is the most supported option for reducing the risk of insulin resistance, obesity, and metabolic syndrome.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "
