You would be concerned about the use of this drug if the patient also had what comorbid condition\n\n                    ### Options\n                    opa. Glaucoma\nopb. Essential tremor\nopc. Diabetes\nopd. Supraventricular tachycardia\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nPropranolol is a non-selective beta-blocker used prophylactically after myocardial infarction. It can mask hypoglycemia symptoms, which is a concern in patients with diabetes, as it may decrease their awareness of hypoglycemic episodes. This aligns with the consensus that beta-blockers can interfere with glucose metabolism and mask adrenergic symptoms of hypoglycemia. The evidence path confirms propranolol's classification as a beta-blocker, supporting its role in affecting adrenergic responses. While propranolol can also cause bronchoconstriction, which is relevant for asthma, this is not directly related to the options provided. The concern with supraventricular tachycardia is less about propranolol's use and more about its therapeutic role in managing such conditions. Propranolol is actually used to manage essential tremor and glaucoma, making these conditions less concerning in this context. Therefore, the most concerning comorbid condition when using propranolol is diabetes due to the risk of masking hypoglycemia.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Propranolol is a non-selective beta-blocker commonly used after myocardial infarction to reduce the risk of further cardiac events. However, it can mask the symptoms of hypoglycemia, such as tachycardia and tremors, which are critical warning signs for patients with diabetes. This masking effect can lead to unrecognized and potentially dangerous hypoglycemic episodes. While propranolol is used to treat conditions like essential tremor and glaucoma, and it can be beneficial in managing supraventricular tachycardia, the primary concern in this scenario is its impact on diabetes management. Therefore, the most concerning comorbid condition when using propranolol is diabetes due to the risk of masking hypoglycemia.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opc\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
