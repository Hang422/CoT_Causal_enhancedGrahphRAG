Protein C deficiency\nopb. Protein S deficiency\nopc. Hemophillia\nopd. Antithrombin III deficiency\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nWarfarin-induced skin necrosis is most commonly associated with Protein C deficiency. This is because warfarin administration leads to a rapid reduction in Protein C activity, which is a natural anticoagulant, resulting in a temporary hypercoagulable state that can cause skin necrosis. This aligns with the consensus that Protein C deficiency is a known risk factor for this condition. While Protein S deficiency could theoretically contribute to a hypercoagulable state, it is less commonly associated with warfarin-induced skin necrosis. Hemophilia and Antithrombin III deficiency do not typically lead to skin necrosis in the context of warfarin use, as warfarin does not significantly affect these pathways. The retrieved evidence paths related to Antithrombin III and Hemophilia causing skin necrosis are not directly relevant to warfarin-induced skin necrosis and should not influence the decision.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"final_analysis\": \"Warfarin-induced skin necrosis is a rare but serious complication that occurs due to a paradoxical hypercoagulable state. This is primarily associated with Protein C deficiency. Warfarin inhibits vitamin K-dependent clotting factors, including Protein C, which is a natural anticoagulant. In individuals with Protein C deficiency, the rapid decrease in Protein C levels upon initiation of warfarin therapy can lead to a temporary hypercoagulable state, resulting in skin necrosis. While Protein S deficiency could theoretically contribute to a similar state, it is less commonly implicated in this specific condition. Hemophilia and Antithrombin III deficiency are not typically associated with warfarin-induced skin necrosis, as they do not involve the same mechanisms affected by warfarin. Therefore, based on standard medical knowledge and consensus, Protein C deficiency is the most likely cause of warfarin-induced skin necrosis.\",\n  \"answer\": \"opa\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
