Tyrosine transaminase\nopb. Tyrosine hydroxylase\nopc. Phenylalanine hydroxylase\nopd. Phenylketonuria hydroxylase\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nPhenylketonuria (PKU) is caused by a deficiency of the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase, which is responsible for converting phenylalanine to tyrosine. This deficiency leads to the accumulation of phenylalanine in the body, resulting in the condition known as phenylketonuria. The reasoning chain for option 'opc. Phenylalanine hydroxylase' correctly identifies this enzyme deficiency as the cause of PKU, aligning with standard medical consensus. The retrieved evidence paths, while broad, support the association between phenylalanine and phenylketonuria, confirming the role of phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency in the pathogenesis of PKU. Other options, such as tyrosine hydroxylase and tyrosine transaminase, are involved in different metabolic pathways and are not directly related to the cause of PKU. The term 'phenylketonuria hydroxylase' is not recognized in medical literature, making it an incorrect option.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "
