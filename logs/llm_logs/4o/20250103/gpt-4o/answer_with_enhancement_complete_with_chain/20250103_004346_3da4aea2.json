Retro bulbar neuritis\nopb. Deafness\nopc. Red urine\nopd. Peripheral neuritis\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nEthambutol is well-documented to cause optic nerve toxicity, leading to retro bulbar neuritis, which aligns with standard medical consensus. This is supported by evidence paths indicating Ethambutol's effects on the optic nerve. There is no strong consensus or evidence linking Ethambutol to deafness, red urine, or peripheral neuritis. Therefore, the most accurate and consensus-supported effect of Ethambutol is retro bulbar neuritis.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "

This is a well-documented side effect and is widely recognized in medical literature. There is no substantial evidence or consensus linking Ethambutol to causing deafness, red urine, or peripheral neuritis.
