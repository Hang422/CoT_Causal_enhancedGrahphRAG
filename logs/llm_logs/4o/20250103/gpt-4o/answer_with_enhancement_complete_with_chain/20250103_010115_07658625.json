What action should be taken regarding the treatment of the nurse\n\n                    ### Options\n                    opa. Monitor the nurse's blood to determine whether HIV transmission has occurred or not.\nopb. Treat with full doses of zidovudine for 2weeks.\nopc. Add acyclovir to the 4weeks zidovudine regimen\nopd. Administer zidovudine with lamivudine for 4weeks.\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nIn the case of a needle stick injury involving a patient with a high viral load and low CD4 count, there is a high risk of HIV transmission. Standard medical consensus recommends immediate post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) to reduce the risk of seroconversion. The recommended PEP regimen is a combination of antiretroviral drugs, typically including zidovudine and lamivudine, administered for 4 weeks. This regimen is supported by evidence indicating its effectiveness in preventing HIV transmission. Monitoring the nurse's blood without initiating PEP is inadequate as it delays necessary intervention. A 2-week course of zidovudine alone is considered insufficient according to current guidelines. The retrieved evidence paths, while broad, support the use of zidovudine as part of a PEP regimen for viral prevention, aligning with the consensus for a 4-week combination therapy.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "
