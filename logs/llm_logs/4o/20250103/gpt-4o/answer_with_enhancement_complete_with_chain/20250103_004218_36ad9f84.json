Acyclovir\nopb. Vidarabine\nopc. Ganciclovir\nopd. Amantadine\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nIn the treatment of herpes simplex encephalitis, the standard antiviral medication is Acyclovir, which is widely accepted and used due to its effectiveness against the herpes simplex virus. Vidarabine was historically used but has largely been replaced by Acyclovir due to better efficacy and safety profiles. Ganciclovir is primarily used for cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections and is not typically used for herpes simplex encephalitis. Amantadine is not an antiviral for herpes simplex virus; it is used for influenza A and has no role in treating herpes simplex encephalitis. Therefore, the drug not used for herpes simplex encephalitis is Amantadine.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "
