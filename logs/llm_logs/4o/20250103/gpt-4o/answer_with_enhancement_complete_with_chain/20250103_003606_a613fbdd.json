Adenylyl cyclase\nopc. Na+-K+-ATPase\nopd. Galactosyl transferase\n\n### Enhanced Information (For Contextual Support):\nEnzymatic markers of the plasma membrane typically include enzymes that are localized to or function at the plasma membrane. 5'-nucleotidase, adenylyl cyclase, and Na+-K+-ATPase are all well-established markers of the plasma membrane due to their roles and localization. 5'-nucleotidase is involved in nucleotide metabolism at the cell surface, adenylyl cyclase is a key enzyme in signal transduction pathways at the plasma membrane, and Na+-K+-ATPase is crucial for maintaining ion gradients across the plasma membrane. In contrast, galactosyl transferase is primarily localized to the Golgi apparatus, where it functions in glycosylation processes, and is not considered a marker for the plasma membrane. The evidence path indicating the Golgi apparatus as part of the cell membrane is too broad and does not specifically support galactosyl transferase as a plasma membrane marker. Therefore, the correct answer is that galactosyl transferase is not a marker for the plasma membrane.\n\n                    ### Task:\n                1. Identify the core medical principle and the most likely correct option based on consensus.\n                2. If the evidence is not perfectly clear, pick the best-supported option and explain the reasoning.\n                3. Provide a final analysis and a confidence score (0-100%).\n\n                ### Output Format:\n                {\n                  \"final_analysis\": \"Step-by-step reasoning, prioritizing medical consensus and acknowledging complexity if present.\",\n                  \"answer\": \"Option key (e.g. opa, opb, ...)\",\n                  \"confidence\": A number between 0-100\n                }\n                    "
