      "content": "\n        You are a medical expert. Generate multiple reasoning chains for the following question.\n\n            Each chain:\n            - Uses '->' to connect sequential reasoning states.\n            - Each step is a single state or result, not a complete causal sentence in one step.\n              Example:\n                Correct: \"Insulin\" -> \"decreased blood glucose\" -> \"improved metabolism\" -> 90%\n                Incorrect: \"Insulin decreases blood glucose\" in one step.\n            - End with a confidence percentage (0-100%).\n\n            If a step clearly conflicts with widely accepted medical knowledge, you may indicate uncertainty (e.g., \n            \"possible\", \"unclear\") and slightly lower confidence. However, do this only if necessary. If unsure, \n            it is acceptable to show a plausible chain with moderate confidence.\n\n            ### Question\n            Accidental from a needle stick, an unknown quantity of blood from an AIDS patient is injected into a nurse, lab reports of the patient show CD4 count 20/microL and a viral RNA load of more than 10^7copies/ml. What action should be taken regarding the treatment of the nurse\n\n            ### Options\n    opa. Monitor the nurse's blood to determine whether HIV transmission has occurred or not.\nopb. Treat with full doses of zidovudine for 2weeks.\nopc. Add acyclovir to the 4weeks zidovudine regimen\nopd. Administer zidovudine with lamivudine for 4weeks.\n\n            ### Instructions:\n            - Keep steps simple, each step just one state or outcome.\n            - '->' separates each step.\n            \n            ### Output Format:\n            Start each chain with \"CHAIN:\" on a new line.\n            Example:\n            CHAIN: \"Insulin\" -> \"decreased blood glucose\" -> \"improved metabolic state\" -> 90%"
