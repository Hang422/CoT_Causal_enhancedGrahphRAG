A spontaneous pneumothorax occurs when air enters the pleural space, causing part of the lung to collapse, which aligns with the X-ray finding. The other options, such as myocardial infarction, acute cor pulmonale, and aortic dissection, do not typically present with an area devoid of lung markings on an X-ray.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opa\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
