  "response": "```json\n{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"The substantia nigra is a critical component of the basal ganglia system and is involved in the regulation of movement. It is known for its role in the production of dopamine, which is a neurotransmitter essential for motor control. The efferent fibers of the substantia nigra, specifically the pars compacta, project to the corpus striatum, which includes the caudate nucleus and putamen. This dopaminergic pathway is crucial for modulating the activity of the striatum and is implicated in disorders such as Parkinson's disease.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opb\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
