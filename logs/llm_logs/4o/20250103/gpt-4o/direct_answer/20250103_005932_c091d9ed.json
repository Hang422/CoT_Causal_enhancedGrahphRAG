The zona reticularis primarily secretes androgens, which are a group of hormones that play a role in male traits and reproductive activity. While the zona fasciculata mainly produces glucocorticoids and the zona glomerulosa produces mineralocorticoids like aldosterone, the zona reticularis is specifically associated with the production of androgens.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opd\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
