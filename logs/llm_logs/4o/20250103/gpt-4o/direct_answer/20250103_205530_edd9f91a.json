  "response": "```json\n{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Tamoxifen is a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) commonly used in the treatment of estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer. It has mixed agonist and antagonist effects on estrogen receptors in different tissues. In the endometrium, tamoxifen acts as an estrogen agonist, which can lead to endometrial hyperplasia and increase the risk of endometrial cancer. It does not typically cause osteoporosis; in fact, it may have a protective effect on bone density. Tamoxifen is not associated with an increased risk of ovarian cancer, and it can have a favorable effect on lipid profiles, including decreasing triglyceride levels.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opb\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
