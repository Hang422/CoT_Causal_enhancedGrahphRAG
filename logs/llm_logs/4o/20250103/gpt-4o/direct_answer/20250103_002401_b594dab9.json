  "response": "```json\n{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Bleeding esophageal varices are a serious complication often associated with portal hypertension, commonly due to liver cirrhosis. The primary goal in managing acute variceal bleeding is to control the hemorrhage and stabilize the patient. Octreotide, a somatostatin analogue, is frequently used as it reduces portal blood flow and pressure, thereby helping to control bleeding. Ethanolamine oleate is a sclerosant used in endoscopic sclerotherapy, but it is not the first-line pharmacological treatment. Propranolol is used for prophylaxis to prevent variceal bleeding but not for acute management. Phytonadione (vitamin K) is used to correct coagulopathy but does not directly address variceal bleeding. Therefore, the drug of choice for acute bleeding esophageal varices is Octreotide.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opb\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
