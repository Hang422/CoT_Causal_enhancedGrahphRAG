They act on the Na+-K+-2Cl- symporter in the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle. They can cause hyperuricemia due to increased reabsorption of uric acid. However, loop diuretics typically lead to hypocalcemia, not hypercalcemia, and hypomagnesemia due to increased excretion of calcium and magnesium.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opd\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
