  "response": "```json\n{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Tamoxifen is a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) used in the treatment of estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer. It is known to have several adverse effects. Thromboembolism is a recognized risk due to its estrogenic effects on the liver, which can increase clotting factors. Endometrial carcinoma is a potential risk because tamoxifen acts as an estrogen agonist in the uterus, which can stimulate endometrial proliferation. Cataracts have also been reported as a possible side effect. However, tamoxifen is generally protective against the development of breast cancer in the contralateral breast, rather than causing it.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opc\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
