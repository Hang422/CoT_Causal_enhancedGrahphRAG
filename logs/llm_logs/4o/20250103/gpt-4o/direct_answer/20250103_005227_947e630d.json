Pilocarpine is a miotic agent used to treat acute angle closure glaucoma by constricting the pupil and opening the angle. Clozapine and fluphenazine are antipsychotic medications, and paroxetine is an SSRI antidepressant. Antipsychotics and SSRIs can have anticholinergic effects, which may exacerbate glaucoma. Among the options, clozapine is known for its significant anticholinergic properties, making it particularly unsuitable for patients with glaucoma.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opb\",\n    \"confidence\": 90\n}\n```",
