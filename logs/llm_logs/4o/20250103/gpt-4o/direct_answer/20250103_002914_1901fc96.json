  "response": "```json\n{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Atropine is a muscarinic receptor antagonist, which means it specifically blocks the effects of acetylcholine on muscarinic receptors. Bradycardia caused by the infusion of acetylcholine is mediated through muscarinic receptors in the heart. Therefore, atropine can block this effect. The other options involve mechanisms that are not mediated by muscarinic receptors: nicotine affects nicotinic receptors, and neostigmine increases skeletal muscle strength by inhibiting acetylcholinesterase, affecting nicotinic receptors at the neuromuscular junction.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opc\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
