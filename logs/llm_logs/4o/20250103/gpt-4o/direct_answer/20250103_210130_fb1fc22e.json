  "response": "```json\n{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Peptic ulcer disease caused by chronic use of NSAIDs is often due to the inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis, which leads to decreased gastric mucosal protection. Misoprostol is a prostaglandin E1 analog that can help prevent NSAID-induced gastric ulcers by replacing the protective prostaglandins. Therefore, it is the drug of choice for this condition. Esomeprazole, a proton pump inhibitor, can also be used to reduce gastric acid secretion, but it does not address the prostaglandin deficiency directly.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opc\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
