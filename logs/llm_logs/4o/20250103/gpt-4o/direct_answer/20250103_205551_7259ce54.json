  "response": "```json\n{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Dobutamine is a synthetic catecholamine that primarily acts as a selective beta-1 adrenergic receptor agonist, which increases cardiac contractility and output with less effect on heart rate compared to dopamine. Unlike dopamine, dobutamine does not activate peripheral dopaminergic receptors, which are responsible for renal vasodilation. Therefore, the correct answer is that dobutamine does not activate peripheral dopaminergic receptors.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opd\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
