Cholestyramine can reduce the absorption of digoxin, and quinidine can increase digoxin levels by reducing its clearance. Thiazide diuretics can lead to hypokalemia, which can enhance digoxin toxicity. Amlodipine, a calcium channel blocker, does not have a significant interaction with digoxin, making it the exception among the options provided.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opd\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
