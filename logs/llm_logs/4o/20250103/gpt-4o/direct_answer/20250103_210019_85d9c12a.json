  "response": "```json\n{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Epinephrine, also known as adrenaline, is a hormone and medication that primarily acts on alpha and beta adrenergic receptors. When administered in high doses intravenously, it typically increases liver glycogenolysis (option a), causes bronchodilation rather than bronchoconstriction (option b), can evoke extrasystoles in the heart due to its stimulatory effects on cardiac tissue (option c), and can produce restlessness and anxiety due to its effects on the central nervous system (option d). Therefore, the action that is not consistent with the effects of high-dose intravenous epinephrine is bronchiolar constriction.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opb\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
