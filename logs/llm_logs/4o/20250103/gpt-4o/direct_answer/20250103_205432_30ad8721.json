It works by stimulating the immune system to release cytokines, which help in clearing the human papillomavirus (HPV) infection that causes these warts. Podophylline is a plant-derived compound used for wart treatment but is not an immunomodulator. Interferon is an immunomodulator but is not typically used topically for genital warts. Acyclovir is an antiviral medication used for herpes infections, not for genital warts.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opa\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
