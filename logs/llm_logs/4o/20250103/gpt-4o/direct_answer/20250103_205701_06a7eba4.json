  "response": "```json\n{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"The fluidity of the plasma membrane is influenced by the types of fatty acids present in the phospholipids and the presence of cholesterol. Unsaturated fatty acids, like arachidonic acid, increase membrane fluidity due to their kinked structure, which prevents tight packing of the lipid molecules. Saturated fatty acids, such as palmitic acid and stearic acid, decrease fluidity because they allow for tighter packing. Cholesterol has a complex role; it can both increase and decrease fluidity depending on the temperature and the specific lipid environment. However, in general, cholesterol tends to stabilize the membrane structure. Therefore, among the given options, arachidonic acid, being an unsaturated fatty acid, is most likely to increase membrane fluidity.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opa\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
