  "response": "```json\n{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Methotrexate is a weak acid, and maintaining a high urinary pH helps to keep it in its ionized form, which is more soluble in urine. This reduces the risk of methotrexate crystallizing in the renal tubules, which can lead to nephrotoxicity. Therefore, the correct reason for maintaining a high urinary pH during methotrexate treatment is that methotrexate is a weak acid.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opd\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
