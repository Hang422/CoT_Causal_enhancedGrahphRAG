  "response": "```json\n{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"The respiratory center is primarily located in the medulla oblongata and pons, not the midbrain. It is not directly stimulated by a fall in PaO2; rather, it is more sensitive to changes in PaCO2 and pH. The respiratory center is connected with the cardiac center as both are part of the autonomic nervous system and are located in the brainstem. Swallowing temporarily inhibits respiration to prevent aspiration, which is a protective reflex.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opc\",\n    \"confidence\": 90\n}\n```",
