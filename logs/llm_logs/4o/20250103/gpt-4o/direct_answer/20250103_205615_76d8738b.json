However, when it comes to their transport into the mitochondria for oxidation, they are not directly transported by albumin. Instead, they are activated to acyl-CoA and then transported into the mitochondria via the carnitine shuttle system. The options provided do not include the correct mechanism for mitochondrial transport. Therefore, none of the options directly answer the question correctly.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opa\",\n    \"confidence\": 90\n}\n```",
