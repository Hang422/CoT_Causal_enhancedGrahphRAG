  "response": "```json\n{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Cyclic AMP (cAMP) primarily acts by activating protein kinase A (PKA), which is a key mechanism in many signaling pathways. While cAMP is produced by the activation of adenylate cyclase, it does not directly activate adenylate cyclase. cAMP does not directly cause Ca2+ release, although it can influence pathways that involve calcium signaling. Therefore, the most direct action of cAMP is the activation of protein kinase.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opa\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
