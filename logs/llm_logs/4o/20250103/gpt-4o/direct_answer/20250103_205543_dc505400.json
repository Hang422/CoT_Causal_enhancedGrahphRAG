It works by reducing the frequency of urination during sleep. The other options, Fluvoxamine, Phenelzine, and Bupropion, are not typically used for this condition. Fluvoxamine is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), Phenelzine is a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI), and Bupropion is an atypical antidepressant, none of which are indicated for nocturnal enuresis.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opa\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
