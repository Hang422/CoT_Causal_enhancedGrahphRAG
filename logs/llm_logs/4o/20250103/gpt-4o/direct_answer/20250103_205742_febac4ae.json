  "response": "```json\n{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"The enzyme responsible for the conversion of androgens to estrogens in the ovarian follicle is aromatase. Aromatase catalyzes the aromatization of androgens, such as testosterone and androstenedione, into estrogens, such as estradiol and estrone. This process is crucial for estrogen production in the ovaries. 5 alpha reductase is involved in the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone, desmolase is involved in steroidogenesis, and isomerase is involved in the conversion of steroid precursors but not specifically in the conversion of androgens to estrogens.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opa\",\n    \"confidence\": 100\n}\n```",
