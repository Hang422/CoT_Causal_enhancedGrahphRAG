This is because Methimazole has been associated with teratogenic effects, such as aplasia cutis and other congenital malformations, when used during the first trimester. PTU is considered safer during this period, although it is typically switched to Methimazole in the second trimester to avoid potential liver toxicity associated with prolonged PTU use.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opb\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
