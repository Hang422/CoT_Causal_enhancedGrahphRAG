LMWH is favored due to its predictable pharmacokinetics, ease of administration, and lower risk of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia compared to unfractionated heparin. It is also more effective and safer than warfarin in the perioperative setting for cancer patients.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opc\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
