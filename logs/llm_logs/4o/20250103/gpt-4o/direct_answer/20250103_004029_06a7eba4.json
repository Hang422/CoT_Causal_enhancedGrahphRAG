  "response": "```json\n{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"The fluidity of the plasma membrane is influenced by the types of fatty acids and cholesterol present. Unsaturated fatty acids, like arachidonic acid, increase membrane fluidity due to their kinked structure, which prevents tight packing of the lipid molecules. In contrast, saturated fatty acids like palmitic acid and stearic acid decrease fluidity because they allow for tighter packing. Cholesterol has a complex role; it can both increase and decrease fluidity depending on the temperature and the specific lipid environment. However, in general, unsaturated fatty acids are more directly associated with increased fluidity.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opa\",\n    \"confidence\": 90\n}\n```",
