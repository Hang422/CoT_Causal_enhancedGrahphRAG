  "response": "```json\n{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Enzymatic markers of the plasma membrane are typically enzymes that are associated with the membrane's structure and function. 5'-nucleotidase, adenylyl cyclase, and Na+-K+-ATPase are well-known enzymes associated with the plasma membrane. 5'-nucleotidase is involved in nucleotide metabolism, adenylyl cyclase is involved in the conversion of ATP to cyclic AMP, and Na+-K+-ATPase is crucial for maintaining the electrochemical gradient across the plasma membrane. Galactosyl transferase, however, is primarily associated with the Golgi apparatus, where it plays a role in glycosylation processes. Therefore, it is not considered a marker of the plasma membrane.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opd\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
