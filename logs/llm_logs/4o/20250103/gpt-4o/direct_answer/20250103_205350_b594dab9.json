  "response": "```json\n{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Octreotide is a somatostatin analogue that is commonly used as the drug of choice for acute management of bleeding esophageal varices. It works by reducing portal venous pressure and splanchnic blood flow, which helps control the bleeding. Ethanolamine oleate is a sclerosing agent used in endoscopic sclerotherapy, but it is not the first-line pharmacological treatment. Propranolol is used for prophylaxis to prevent variceal bleeding but not for acute bleeding. Phytonadione (vitamin K) is used to correct coagulopathy but does not directly address variceal bleeding.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opb\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
