This process is crucial for the production of estrogens, such as estradiol, during the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle. 5 alpha reductase is involved in the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone, desmolase is involved in steroidogenesis, and isomerase is involved in the conversion of steroid precursors but not specifically in the conversion of androgens to estrogens.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opa\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
