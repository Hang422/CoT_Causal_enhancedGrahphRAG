  "response": "```json\n{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"The plasma membrane is connected to the cytoskeleton through various proteins that provide structural support and stability. Spectrin is a cytoskeletal protein that forms a meshwork on the inner surface of the plasma membrane, particularly in red blood cells, and is linked to the membrane through ankyrin. Ankyrin is a protein that anchors the spectrin-actin cytoskeleton to the plasma membrane by binding to integral membrane proteins. Tubulin is a component of microtubules, and laminin is an extracellular matrix protein, neither of which directly bind the plasma membrane to the cytoskeleton. Therefore, ankyrin is the correct answer as it directly facilitates the connection between the plasma membrane and the cytoskeleton.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opb\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
