Certain drugs are known to cause myopathy as a side effect. Chloroquine and Zidovudine are both associated with myopathy. Betamethasone, a corticosteroid, can cause muscle weakness but is not typically associated with myopathy in the same way as the others. Chloramphenicol, an antibiotic, is not commonly linked to myopathy. Therefore, the drug that does not cause myopathy is Chloramphenicol.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opc\",\n    \"confidence\": 90\n}\n```",
