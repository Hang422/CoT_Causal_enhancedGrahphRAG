It also plays a role in activating collagenase, which is involved in the breakdown of collagen. Plasmin can degrade von Willebrand factor (VWF) to some extent. However, stabilization of fibrin is not a function of plasmin; rather, it is the role of factor XIII, which cross-links fibrin to stabilize the clot.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opd\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
