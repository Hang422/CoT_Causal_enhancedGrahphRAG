It consists of two polypeptide chains, A and B, which are connected by disulfide bonds. Insulin facilitates the uptake of glucose and potassium into cells, not the shift of potassium outside the cell. The half-life of subcutaneously administered insulin is variable, but typically ranges from 4 to 6 minutes in circulation, not 60 minutes.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opb\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
