  "response": "```json\n{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"In diabetic ketoacidosis, there is a decrease in insulin levels, leading to an increase in free fatty acids due to enhanced lipolysis. These free fatty acids are converted into ketone bodies, causing ketoacidosis. The blood glucose levels are elevated due to decreased insulin, which is not equivalent to the increase in free fatty acids. Therefore, the correct feature of ketoacidosis due to diabetes mellitus is decreased insulin, increased free fatty acid which is not equivalent to blood glucose.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opc\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
