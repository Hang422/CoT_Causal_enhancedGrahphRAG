  "response": "```json\n{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"The medullary respiratory neurons are primarily stimulated by changes in the levels of carbon dioxide (PCO2) and hydrogen ions (H+) in the blood, which are indicators of the body's need to increase ventilation. A rise in PCO2 and H+ concentration will increase respiratory neuron activity to expel more CO2 and maintain pH balance. A drop in Po2 can also stimulate respiratory activity, although it is a less sensitive trigger compared to CO2 levels. However, a rise in Po2 does not stimulate respiratory neurons and is not a factor that increases their activity.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opc\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
