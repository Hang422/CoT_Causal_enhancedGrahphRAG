  "response": "```json\n{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Finasteride is a 5α reductase inhibitor that is commonly used to treat both benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH) and male pattern baldness (androgenetic alopecia). It works by inhibiting the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT), which is involved in the pathogenesis of both conditions. Flutamide is an antiandrogen, prazosin is an alpha-blocker, and minoxidil is a vasodilator used topically for hair growth, none of which are 5α reductase inhibitors.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opb\",\n    \"confidence\": 100\n}\n```",
