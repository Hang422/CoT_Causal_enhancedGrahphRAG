  "response": "```json\n{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Inherited hyperammonemia is typically associated with deficiencies in enzymes of the urea cycle, which is responsible for converting ammonia to urea for excretion. The enzymes listed in the options are not directly part of the urea cycle. However, N-acetyl glutamate synthetase is crucial for the activation of carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I, the first enzyme in the urea cycle. A deficiency in N-acetyl glutamate synthetase can lead to hyperammonemia due to impaired urea cycle function.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opc\",\n    \"confidence\": 90\n}\n```",
