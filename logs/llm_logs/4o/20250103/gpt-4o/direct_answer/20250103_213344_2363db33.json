  "response": "```json\n{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"The Hexose Monophosphate (HMP) shunt, also known as the pentose phosphate pathway, is a metabolic pathway parallel to glycolysis. It is present in all cells that require NADPH for biosynthetic reactions and ribose-5-phosphate for nucleotide synthesis. The pathway is particularly active in tissues involved in fatty acid and steroid synthesis, such as the liver and adipose tissue, and in cells that require protection against oxidative damage, such as red blood cells (RBCs). The brain, however, primarily relies on glycolysis and the citric acid cycle for its energy needs and has a lower demand for NADPH, making the HMP shunt less prominent in this organ.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opd\",\n    \"confidence\": 90\n}\n```",
