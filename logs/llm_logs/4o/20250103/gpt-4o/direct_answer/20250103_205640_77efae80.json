  "response": "```json\n{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"The symptoms described in the question, including aggressive behavior, self-mutilation, joint pain, and reduced urinary output, are characteristic of Lesch-Nyhan syndrome. This condition is caused by a deficiency of the enzyme hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT), which is not listed among the options. However, the closest match in terms of purine metabolism disorders is Adenosine Deaminase deficiency, which is associated with immunodeficiency rather than the specific symptoms described. Given the options, none directly match the expected enzyme deficiency for Lesch-Nyhan syndrome.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opb\",\n    \"confidence\": 50\n}\n```",
