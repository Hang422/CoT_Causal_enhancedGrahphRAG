These enzymes are directly involved in the urea cycle, which is responsible for converting ammonia into urea for excretion. Ornithine amino transferase, however, is not part of the urea cycle and its deficiency does not typically result in hyperammonemia.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opd\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
