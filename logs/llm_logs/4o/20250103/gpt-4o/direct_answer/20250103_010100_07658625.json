  "response": "```json\n{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"In the case of a needle stick injury involving a high-risk exposure to HIV, such as from a patient with a very low CD4 count and high viral load, post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) is recommended. The standard PEP regimen involves a combination of antiretroviral drugs. Zidovudine (AZT) and lamivudine (3TC) are commonly used together as part of a PEP regimen. Acyclovir is not used for HIV PEP as it is an antiviral for herpes viruses, not HIV. Monitoring alone is not sufficient due to the high risk of transmission. Therefore, the most appropriate action is to administer zidovudine with lamivudine for 4 weeks.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opd\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
