  "response": "```json\n{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Constriction of the afferent arteriole reduces blood flow into the glomerulus, leading to a decrease in glomerular filtration pressure. This results in a reduction of the glomerular filtration rate (GFR), which subsequently decreases urinary output. Therefore, the correct answer is that both the GFR and urine output decrease.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opa\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
