  "response": "```json\n{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"For prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism in patients undergoing cancer surgery, low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) is the preferred anticoagulant. LMWH is favored due to its predictable pharmacokinetics, ease of administration, and lower risk of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia compared to unfractionated heparin. Protamine sulfate is not an anticoagulant; it is used to reverse the effects of heparin. Warfarin is not typically used for immediate prophylaxis in the surgical setting due to its delayed onset of action.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opc\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
