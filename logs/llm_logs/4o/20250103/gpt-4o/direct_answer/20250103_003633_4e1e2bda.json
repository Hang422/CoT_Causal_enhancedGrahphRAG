One of the key substances they secrete is androgen-binding protein (ABP), which helps concentrate testosterone in the seminiferous tubules, facilitating spermatogenesis. Testosterone is produced by Leydig cells, not Sertoli cells. LH (Luteinizing Hormone) and FSH (Follicle Stimulating Hormone) are hormones secreted by the anterior pituitary gland, not by Sertoli cells.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opa\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
