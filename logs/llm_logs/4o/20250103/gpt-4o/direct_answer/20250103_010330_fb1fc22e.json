  "response": "```json\n{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Peptic ulcer disease caused by chronic use of NSAIDs is often due to the inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis, which leads to decreased gastric mucosal protection. Misoprostol is a prostaglandin E1 analog that helps to protect the gastric lining by increasing mucus and bicarbonate secretion and enhancing mucosal blood flow. Therefore, it is specifically used to prevent NSAID-induced gastric ulcers. Esomeprazole, a proton pump inhibitor, is also used to treat peptic ulcers by reducing gastric acid secretion, but Misoprostol is more directly indicated for NSAID-induced ulcers.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opc\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
