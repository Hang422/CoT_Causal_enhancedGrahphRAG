  "response": "```json\n{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Cholesterol is transported from the liver to peripheral tissues primarily by low-density lipoproteins (LDL). LDL is responsible for delivering cholesterol to cells throughout the body, where it can be used for membrane synthesis and other functions. High-density lipoproteins (HDL) are involved in reverse cholesterol transport, carrying cholesterol from peripheral tissues back to the liver. Very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL) primarily transport triglycerides, and chylomicrons are involved in the transport of dietary lipids from the intestines. Therefore, LDL is the main transporter of cholesterol from the liver to peripheral tissues.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opb\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
