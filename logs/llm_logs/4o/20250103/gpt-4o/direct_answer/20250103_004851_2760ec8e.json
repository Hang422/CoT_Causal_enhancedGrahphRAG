  "response": "```json\n{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"In circulatory biomechanics, anemia typically leads to decreased blood viscosity due to the reduced number of red blood cells. This can result in increased cardiac output as the heart compensates for the lower oxygen-carrying capacity by pumping more blood. Conversely, polycythemia, which involves an increased number of red blood cells, leads to increased blood viscosity. Beri-Beri, a condition caused by thiamine deficiency, can lead to increased cardiac output due to peripheral vasodilation and high-output heart failure, not decreased cardiac output.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opc\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
