It is not associated with causing hypokalemia; in fact, it can lead to hyperkalemia. Muscle cramps can occur as a side effect of diuretics, including triamterene, due to electrolyte imbalances. Triamterene does not typically affect glucose tolerance or urea levels directly.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opb\",\n    \"confidence\": 90\n}\n```",
