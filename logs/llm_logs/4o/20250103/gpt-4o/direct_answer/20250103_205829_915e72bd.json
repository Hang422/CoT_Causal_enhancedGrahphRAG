  "response": "```json\n{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"The stomach secretes several substances that aid in digestion. Pepsinogens are secreted by the chief cells and are precursors to pepsin, an enzyme that digests proteins. Hydrochloric acid (HCl) is secreted by the parietal cells and helps create an acidic environment for pepsin to function. Gastric lipase is also secreted by the stomach and plays a role in the digestion of lipids. Therefore, all the options listed are secreted by the stomach.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opd\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
