  "response": "```json\n{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"In patients with cancer, particularly those with lung cancer, dyspnea (difficulty breathing) is a common symptom. Opioids, such as morphine, are often used to palliate dyspnea because they can reduce the sensation of breathlessness by acting on the central nervous system. Morphine patches provide a continuous release of the medication, which can be beneficial for managing chronic symptoms like dyspnea. While benzodiazepines like diazepam and clobazam can help with anxiety, they are not primarily used for dyspnea. Haloperidol is an antipsychotic and is not typically used for dyspnea management.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opa\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
