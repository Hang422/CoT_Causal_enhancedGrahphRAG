  "response": "```json\n{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"The renal system is responsible for producing several important peptides and hormones. Renin is an enzyme produced by the juxtaglomerular cells of the kidney. Erythropoietin is a hormone produced by the kidneys that stimulates red blood cell production. 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol (1,25DHCC), also known as calcitriol, is the active form of vitamin D and is produced in the kidneys. Angiotensin I, however, is not produced by the renal system; it is formed in the bloodstream when renin acts on angiotensinogen, which is produced by the liver.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opb\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
