  "response": "```json\n{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"The symptoms described in the question, including aggressive behavior, self-mutilation, joint pain, and reduced urinary output, are characteristic of Lesch-Nyhan syndrome. This condition is caused by a deficiency of the enzyme hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT), which is not listed among the options. However, the closest match to the symptoms and the condition described is a deficiency in purine metabolism, which is related to the enzyme Adenosine Deaminase (ADA). While ADA deficiency is more commonly associated with severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), the symptoms in the question align more closely with a purine metabolism disorder, suggesting a possible misalignment in the options provided. Given the options, Adenosine Deaminase is the most relevant choice.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opb\",\n    \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
