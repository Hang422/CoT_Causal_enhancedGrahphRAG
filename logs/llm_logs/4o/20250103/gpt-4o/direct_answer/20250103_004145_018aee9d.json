  "response": "```json\n{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Plasmin is an important enzyme in the fibrinolytic system, primarily responsible for breaking down fibrin clots, a process known as fibrinolysis. It also plays a role in activating collagenase, which is involved in the breakdown of collagen. However, plasmin does not stabilize fibrin; rather, it degrades it. Additionally, while plasmin can degrade various proteins, its role in the destruction of von Willebrand factor (VWF) is not a primary or well-established function. Therefore, the option that does not align with the known functions of plasmin is the stabilization of fibrin.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opd\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
