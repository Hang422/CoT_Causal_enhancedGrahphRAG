The condition described is consistent with hereditary fructose intolerance (HFI), which is caused by a deficiency in the enzyme Aldolase B. This enzyme is responsible for the breakdown of fructose-1-phosphate, and its deficiency leads to the accumulation of toxic metabolites, causing the symptoms observed.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opc\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
