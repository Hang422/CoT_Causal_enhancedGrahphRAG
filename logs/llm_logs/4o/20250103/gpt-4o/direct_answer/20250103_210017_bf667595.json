  "response": "```json\n{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Neurogenic diabetes insipidus, also known as central diabetes insipidus, is characterized by a deficiency of the hormone vasopressin (antidiuretic hormone, ADH) due to a problem with its production in the hypothalamus or release from the posterior pituitary gland. Desmopressin is a synthetic analog of vasopressin and is the drug of choice for treating neurogenic diabetes insipidus because it specifically targets the V2 receptors in the kidneys, effectively reducing urine output and managing the condition. Vasopressin itself can be used, but desmopressin is preferred due to its longer duration of action and fewer side effects.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opc\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
