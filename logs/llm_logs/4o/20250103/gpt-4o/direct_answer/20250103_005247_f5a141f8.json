This leads to hyponatremia due to loss of sodium, hyperkalemia due to retention of potassium, and hypoglycemia due to decreased gluconeogenesis. Metabolic alkalosis is not typically associated with adrenal insufficiency; instead, metabolic acidosis may occur due to the accumulation of hydrogen ions.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opd\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
