  "response": "```json\n{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"The patient is experiencing torsades de pointes, a type of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia that can be induced by medications that prolong the QT interval. Erythromycin is known to prolong the QT interval, and when combined with other medications that have the same effect, the risk of torsades de pointes increases. Cisapride, a medication used for GERD, is known to significantly prolong the QT interval and has been associated with cases of torsades de pointes, especially when used in combination with other QT-prolonging drugs like erythromycin. The other medications listed (famotidine, lansoprazole, and metoclopramide) are not typically associated with significant QT prolongation to the same extent as cisapride.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opa\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
