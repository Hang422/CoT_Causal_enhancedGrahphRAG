Among the options provided, erythromycin estolate is well-documented to cause cholestatic jaundice as a side effect. This is due to its potential to cause liver injury, particularly in the form of cholestasis. The other drugs listed, such as INH (isoniazid), pyrazinamide, and ethionamide, are more commonly associated with hepatocellular injury rather than cholestatic jaundice.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opb\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
