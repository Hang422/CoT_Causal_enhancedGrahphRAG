They are involved in various physiological processes, including inflammation and tissue repair. PARs are known to protect epithelial cells, but they are not directly associated with the release of PGE2 (prostaglandin E2), which is typically released through other pathways involving cyclooxygenase enzymes.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opc\",\n    \"confidence\": 90\n}\n```",
