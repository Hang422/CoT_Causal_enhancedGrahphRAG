  "response": "```json\n{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"The redistribution phenomenon is a pharmacokinetic process where a drug initially distributes to highly perfused organs like the brain and then redistributes to less perfused tissues like muscle and fat. This is commonly seen with highly lipid-soluble drugs that are administered intravenously. Thiopentone, a barbiturate used for induction of anesthesia, is a classic example of a drug that exhibits this phenomenon. It rapidly induces anesthesia due to its quick distribution to the brain, but its effects are short-lived as it redistributes to other tissues.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opc\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
