Its primary role is to stimulate the pancreas to secrete bicarbonate-rich fluid, which helps neutralize the acidity of the chyme. While it also has other effects, such as inhibiting gastric acid secretion and promoting bile production, the most important action is the stimulation of bicarbonate secretion by the pancreas.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opb\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
