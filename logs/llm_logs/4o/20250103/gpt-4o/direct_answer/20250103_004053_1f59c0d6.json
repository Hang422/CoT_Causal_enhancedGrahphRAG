This condition is characterized by the accumulation of chylomicron remnants and IDL due to defective clearance. The presence of palmar xanthomas and increased risk of atherosclerosis and coronary artery disease are classic signs. The underlying pathophysiology is typically due to Apo E deficiency, specifically the presence of Apo E2/E2 genotype, which impairs the binding of lipoproteins to hepatic receptors, leading to their accumulation.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opd\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
