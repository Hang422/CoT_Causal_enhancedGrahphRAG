Methimazole is associated with congenital malformations such as aplasia cutis and choanal atresia when used in the first trimester. PTU is considered safer during this period, although it is typically switched to Methimazole in the second trimester to avoid potential liver toxicity associated with prolonged PTU use.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opb\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
