  "response": "```json\n{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Glycoproteins are proteins that have carbohydrate groups attached to the polypeptide chain. The carbohydrate is typically attached via a glycosidic bond, which is a covalent bond formed between a carbohydrate molecule and another molecule. This makes option 'opa' the most accurate description of a characteristic of glycoproteins. The other options do not accurately describe the typical characteristics of glycoproteins. Option 'opb' refers to a core protein, which is more relevant to proteoglycans, and option 'opc' is incorrect as glycoproteins usually have shorter carbohydrate chains compared to proteoglycans.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opa\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
