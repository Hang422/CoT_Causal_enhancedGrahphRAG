  "response": "```json\n{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Acetaminophen (paracetamol) is not classified as a traditional NSAID because it has minimal anti-inflammatory properties. It primarily acts as an analgesic and antipyretic. Unlike other NSAIDs, acetaminophen does not significantly inhibit cyclooxygenase in peripheral tissues, which is why it is associated with a much lower risk of gastric irritation and ulceration. Diclofenac, ibuprofen, and naproxen are all traditional NSAIDs that can cause gastric irritation due to their mechanism of action involving COX inhibition, which reduces protective gastric prostaglandins.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opb\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
