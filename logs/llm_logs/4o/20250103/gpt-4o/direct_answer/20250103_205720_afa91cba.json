It primarily acts on the cells of the distal convoluted tubule and the collecting duct in the nephron of the kidney. Its main function is to increase sodium reabsorption and potassium excretion, which helps in maintaining blood pressure and fluid balance. Among the given options, the collecting duct is the correct site where aldosterone exerts its effects.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opa\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
