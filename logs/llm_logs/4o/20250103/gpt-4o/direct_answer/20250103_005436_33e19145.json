  "response": "To provide an accurate response, I need more context about the child's symptoms or condition. Each of the enzymes listed is associated with specific metabolic disorders:\n\n1. **HGPRTase (Hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase)**: Deficiency in this enzyme is associated with Lesch-Nyhan syndrome, characterized by neurological and behavioral abnormalities, and hyperuricemia.\n\n2. **Adenosine deaminase**: Deficiency leads to Severe Combined Immunodeficiency (SCID), characterized by a severely compromised immune system.\n\n3. **APRTase (Adenine phosphoribosyltransferase)**: Deficiency can lead to 2,8-dihydroxyadenine urolithiasis, causing kidney stones.\n\n4. **Acid maltase (also known as alpha-glucosidase)**: Deficiency causes Pompe disease, characterized by muscle weakness and respiratory issues.\n\nWithout specific symptoms or context, it's challenging to determine which enzyme deficiency is likely. If you can provide more details about the child's symptoms or condition, I can offer a more precise analysis.\n\nFor now, I'll make an assumption based on commonality and provide a general response:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Without specific symptoms, it's challenging to determine the enzyme deficiency. However, based on commonality in pediatric cases, Adenosine deaminase deficiency is a frequent cause of immunodeficiency in children.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opb\",\n    \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```\n\nPlease provide more details for a more accurate analysis.",
