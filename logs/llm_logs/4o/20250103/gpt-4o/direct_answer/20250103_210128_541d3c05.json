Chloroquine and Zidovudine are both associated with myopathy as potential side effects. Chloramphenicol is primarily associated with hematological side effects, such as aplastic anemia, rather than myopathy. Betamethasone, a corticosteroid, can cause muscle weakness but is not typically associated with myopathy in the same way as the other drugs listed. Therefore, the drug least likely to cause myopathy among the options is Betamethasone.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opb\",\n    \"confidence\": 90\n}\n```",
