  "response": "```json\n{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Epinephrine, also known as adrenaline, is a hormone and medication that primarily acts on alpha and beta adrenergic receptors. When administered intravenously in high doses, it typically increases liver glycogenolysis (option a), causes bronchodilation rather than constriction (option b), can evoke extrasystoles in the heart due to its stimulatory effects (option c), and can produce restlessness and anxiety due to its central nervous system effects (option d). Therefore, bronchiolar constriction is not an action of epinephrine; it actually causes bronchodilation.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opb\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
