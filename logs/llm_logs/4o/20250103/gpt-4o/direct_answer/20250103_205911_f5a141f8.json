  "response": "```json\n{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Adrenal insufficiency, also known as Addison's disease, is characterized by a deficiency in the production of adrenal hormones, particularly cortisol and aldosterone. This condition typically leads to hyponatremia (low sodium levels) due to decreased aldosterone, which causes sodium loss. Hyperkalemia (high potassium levels) is also common because aldosterone normally promotes potassium excretion. Hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) can occur due to reduced cortisol, which is important for glucose metabolism. Metabolic alkalosis, however, is not typically associated with adrenal insufficiency. Instead, metabolic acidosis is more common due to the accumulation of hydrogen ions and decreased bicarbonate reabsorption.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opd\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
