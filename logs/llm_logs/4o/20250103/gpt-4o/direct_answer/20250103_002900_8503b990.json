  "response": "```json\n{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Fosphenytoin is a prodrug of phenytoin, designed to overcome some of the limitations associated with phenytoin administration. One key difference is that fosphenytoin can be mixed with saline, unlike phenytoin, which requires a specific diluent due to its poor solubility and risk of precipitation. This makes option 'opb' the correct choice. Fosphenytoin is not used for absence seizures, cannot be given orally, and is not the drug of choice for myoclonic seizures.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opb\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
