  "response": "```json\n{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"High Density Lipoprotein (HDL) is known for its protective role against cardiovascular diseases. It is involved in reverse cholesterol transport, where it helps to clear cholesterol from atheromas and transport it to the liver for excretion. HDL also has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, which help reduce the oxidation of Low Density Lipoprotein (LDL) and the formation of foam cells. However, HDL is not considered the best predictor of coronary artery disease (CAD); rather, the ratio of total cholesterol to HDL or LDL levels is often used as a better predictor.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opc\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
