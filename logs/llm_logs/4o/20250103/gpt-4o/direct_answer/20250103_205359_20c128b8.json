  "response": "```json\n{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Fluconazole is an antifungal medication that works by inhibiting the enzyme lanosterol 14-alpha-demethylase, which is crucial in the synthesis of ergosterol, an essential component of fungal cell membranes. This mechanism of action aligns with option 'opd'. Fluconazole is not highly effective against aspergillosis, as itraconazole or voriconazole are preferred for this condition, making option 'opa' incorrect. It does penetrate the blood-brain barrier, which is why it is used to treat cryptococcal meningitis, so option 'opb' is incorrect. Fluconazole has excellent oral bioavailability, often greater than that of ketoconazole, making option 'opc' incorrect.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opd\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
