It works by inhibiting sodium reabsorption in the kidneys, which helps to retain potassium. Therefore, it is more likely to cause hyperkalemia (high potassium levels) rather than hypokalemia (low potassium levels). Muscle cramps can be a side effect of triamterene due to electrolyte imbalances, including changes in sodium and potassium levels.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opb\",\n    \"confidence\": 90\n}\n```",
