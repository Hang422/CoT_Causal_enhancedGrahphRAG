Naltrexone works by blocking opioid receptors, reducing the pleasurable effects of alcohol. Acamprosate helps to stabilize the chemical balance in the brain that is disrupted by alcohol dependence. Disulfiram works by causing unpleasant reactions when alcohol is consumed. Flumazenil, on the other hand, is primarily used as a benzodiazepine antagonist and is not used in the treatment of alcohol dependence.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opc\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
