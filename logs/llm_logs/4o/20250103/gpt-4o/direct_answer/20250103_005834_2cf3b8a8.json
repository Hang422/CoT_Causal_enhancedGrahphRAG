  "response": "```json\n{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Naltrexone, Acamprosate, and Disulfiram are all medications commonly used in the treatment of alcohol dependence. Naltrexone is an opioid antagonist that reduces cravings and the rewarding effects of alcohol. Acamprosate helps to stabilize the chemical balance in the brain that is disrupted by alcohol dependence. Disulfiram works by causing unpleasant reactions when alcohol is consumed, thus deterring drinking. Flumazenil, on the other hand, is a benzodiazepine antagonist used primarily to reverse the effects of benzodiazepines and is not used in the treatment of alcohol dependence.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opc\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
