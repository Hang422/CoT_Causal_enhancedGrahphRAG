  "response": "```json\n{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Dobutamine is a synthetic catecholamine that primarily acts as a beta-1 adrenergic agonist, leading to increased cardiac contractility and heart rate. Unlike dopamine, dobutamine does not activate peripheral dopaminergic receptors, which are responsible for renal and mesenteric vasodilation. Dopamine, on the other hand, can activate both dopaminergic and adrenergic receptors depending on the dose. Therefore, the key difference is that dobutamine does not activate peripheral dopaminergic receptors.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opd\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
