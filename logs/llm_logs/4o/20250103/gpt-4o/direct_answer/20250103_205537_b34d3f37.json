  "response": "```json\n{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"The symptoms described in the question are characteristic of acute intermittent porphyria (AIP), a disorder affecting the heme biosynthesis pathway. The darkening of urine upon exposure to sunlight and the exacerbation of symptoms after taking certain drugs like erythromycin are indicative of this condition. AIP is caused by a deficiency in the enzyme porphobilinogen deaminase, leading to an accumulation of porphyrin precursors. Therefore, the patient has difficulty in synthesizing heme.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opa\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
