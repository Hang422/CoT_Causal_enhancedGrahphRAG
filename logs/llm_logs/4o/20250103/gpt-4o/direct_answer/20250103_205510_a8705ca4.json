  "response": "```json\n{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Cholecystokinin (CCK) is a hormone that plays several roles in the digestive system. It is known to stimulate the contraction of the gallbladder, leading to the release of bile into the small intestine. Additionally, CCK stimulates the pancreas to secrete a juice that is rich in digestive enzymes, aiding in the digestion of fats and proteins. However, CCK does not directly increase the secretion of enterokinase. Therefore, the correct actions of CCK include both the contraction of the gallbladder and the secretion of pancreatic juice rich in enzymes.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opd\",\n    \"confidence\": 90\n}\n```",
