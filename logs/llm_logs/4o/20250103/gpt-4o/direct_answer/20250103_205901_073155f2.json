  "response": "```json\n{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Aspirin is known to cause platelet dysfunction by irreversibly inhibiting the cyclooxygenase enzyme, which leads to decreased production of thromboxane A2, a promoter of platelet aggregation. When combined with heparin, which is an anticoagulant, the risk of bleeding increases due to the additive effects on hemostasis. Therefore, aspirin is not given with heparin primarily because of its effect on platelet function.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opa\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
