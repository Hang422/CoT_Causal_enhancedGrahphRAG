  "response": "```json\n{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"In patients with myasthenia gravis, the use of neuromuscular blocking agents can exacerbate muscle weakness. Succinylcholine, a depolarizing neuromuscular blocker, is contraindicated because it can cause prolonged paralysis in these patients due to their altered neuromuscular transmission. Tubocurare, a non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocker, is also typically avoided for similar reasons, but succinylcholine is more specifically contraindicated due to its mechanism of action. Pyridostigmine is actually used to treat myasthenia gravis, and halothane is an anesthetic that does not directly affect neuromuscular transmission in the same way.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opa\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
