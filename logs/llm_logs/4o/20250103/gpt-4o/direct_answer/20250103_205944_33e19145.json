Each of the enzymes listed is associated with specific metabolic disorders:\n\n1. **HGPRTase (Hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase)**: Deficiency leads to Lesch-Nyhan syndrome, characterized by hyperuricemia, self-mutilation, and neurological symptoms.\n\n2. **Adenosine deaminase**: Deficiency causes Severe Combined Immunodeficiency (SCID), leading to severe immunodeficiency and recurrent infections.\n\n3. **APRTase (Adenine phosphoribosyltransferase)**: Deficiency can lead to 2,8-dihydroxyadenine urolithiasis, causing kidney stones.\n\n4. **Acid maltase (also known as alpha-glucosidase)**: Deficiency results in Pompe disease, characterized by muscle weakness and cardiomyopathy.\n\nPlease provide additional details about the child's symptoms or condition to make an informed decision.",
