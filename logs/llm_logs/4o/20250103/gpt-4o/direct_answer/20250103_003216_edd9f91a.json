  "response": "```json\n{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Tamoxifen is a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) commonly used in the treatment of estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer. It acts as an estrogen antagonist in breast tissue but can have estrogen-like effects in other tissues. One of the known side effects of tamoxifen is endometrial hyperplasia, which is due to its partial agonist effect on the endometrium. This can increase the risk of endometrial cancer. Tamoxifen is not typically associated with causing osteoporosis; in fact, it may have a protective effect on bone density in postmenopausal women. It is also not directly linked to causing ovarian cancer or decreasing triglyceride levels.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opb\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
