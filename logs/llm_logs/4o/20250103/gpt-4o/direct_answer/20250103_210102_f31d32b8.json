Hyperparathyroidism often leads to hypercalcemia, while primary aldosteronism is associated with hypokalemia and hypertension. Diabetes mellitus can lead to various electrolyte imbalances, but hypermagnesemia is not a common feature. Kwashiorkor, a form of severe malnutrition, can lead to various electrolyte disturbances, including hypermagnesemia, due to impaired renal function and altered metabolism.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opc\",\n    \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
