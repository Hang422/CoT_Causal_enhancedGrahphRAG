  "response": "```json\n{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"In the context of a 9-year-old boy with uncomplicated pulmonary tuberculosis, the most accurate statement is that his 3-year-old sibling should receive INH prophylaxis. This is because young children who are close contacts of someone with active tuberculosis are at higher risk of developing the disease and are often given isoniazid prophylaxis to prevent infection. Baseline auditory function tests are not essential for the drugs mentioned, as they are more relevant for drugs like streptomycin. Polyarthralgia is not a common adverse effect of the drugs listed; it is more associated with pyrazinamide, which is not mentioned here. The mother, as a close contact, may need evaluation for prophylaxis, but the question does not provide enough information to definitively say she does not need it.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opa\",\n    \"confidence\": 90\n}\n```",
