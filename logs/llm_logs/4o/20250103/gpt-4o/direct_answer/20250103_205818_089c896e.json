  "response": "```json\n{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Gastrin is a hormone primarily secreted by G cells in the antrum of the stomach and the duodenum. It plays a crucial role in stimulating gastric acid secretion by the parietal cells of the stomach. Gastrin secretion is stimulated by the presence of peptides and amino acids in the stomach, as well as by vagal stimulation. Therefore, the statement that gastrin gets stimulated by endoluminal peptides in the stomach is true.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opd\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
