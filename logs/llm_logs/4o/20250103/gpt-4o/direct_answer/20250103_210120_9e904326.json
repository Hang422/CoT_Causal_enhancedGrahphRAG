In cases where a fetus is suspected to have CAH, especially the severe form, prenatal treatment with glucocorticoids can be considered to prevent virilization in female fetuses. Dexamethasone is the drug of choice for this purpose because it crosses the placenta and suppresses the fetal adrenal gland's overproduction of androgens. It is important to note that this treatment is typically initiated early in pregnancy and should be managed by a specialist due to potential risks and ethical considerations.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opa\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
