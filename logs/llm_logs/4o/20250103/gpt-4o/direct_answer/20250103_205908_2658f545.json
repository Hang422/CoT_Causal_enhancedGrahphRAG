  "response": "```json\n{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Inherited hyperammonemia is typically associated with deficiencies in enzymes of the urea cycle, which is responsible for converting ammonia to urea for excretion. The enzymes listed in options 'opa', 'opb', and 'opd' are part of the Krebs cycle, not the urea cycle. N-acetyl glutamate synthetase, listed in option 'opc', is an enzyme that plays a regulatory role in the urea cycle by producing N-acetylglutamate, an essential activator of carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I, the first enzyme of the urea cycle. A deficiency in N-acetyl glutamate synthetase can lead to hyperammonemia due to impaired urea cycle function.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opc\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
