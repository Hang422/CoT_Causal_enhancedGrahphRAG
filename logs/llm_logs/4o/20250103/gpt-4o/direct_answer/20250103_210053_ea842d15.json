  "response": "```json\n{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"The medullary respiratory neurons are primarily stimulated by changes in the levels of carbon dioxide (PCO2) and hydrogen ions (H+) in the blood. An increase in PCO2 or H+ concentration leads to increased respiratory neuron activity to expel more CO2 and maintain pH balance. A drop in Po2 can also stimulate respiratory activity, particularly through peripheral chemoreceptors. However, a rise in Po2 does not stimulate respiratory neurons and may actually reduce their activity. Therefore, a rise in Po2 is the exception among the factors listed.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opc\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
