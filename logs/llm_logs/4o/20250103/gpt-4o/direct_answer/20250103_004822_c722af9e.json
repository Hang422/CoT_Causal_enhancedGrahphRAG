It is known to cause thrombocytopenia in some patients, a condition known as heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). Most commercial heparin is derived from pig intestinal mucosa. However, heparin is not classified as the weakest acid found in living things; this statement is incorrect in the context of heparin's properties.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opa\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
