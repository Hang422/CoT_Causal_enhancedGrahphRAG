  "response": "```json\n{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Hypokalemia, or low potassium levels in the blood, can be caused by several drugs. Amphotericin B is known to cause hypokalemia due to its effect on renal tubules, leading to increased potassium excretion. Insulin can cause hypokalemia by driving potassium into cells, especially during treatment of hyperglycemia. Cyclosporine is not typically associated with hypokalemia; it is more commonly linked to hyperkalemia. Carbenoxolone, a derivative of glycyrrhizinic acid, can cause hypokalemia by mimicking aldosterone, leading to increased renal potassium excretion. NSAIDs are not typically associated with hypokalemia; they can sometimes cause hyperkalemia due to effects on renal function. Therefore, the drugs causing hypokalemia are Amphotericin B, Insulin, and Carbenoxolone.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opd\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
