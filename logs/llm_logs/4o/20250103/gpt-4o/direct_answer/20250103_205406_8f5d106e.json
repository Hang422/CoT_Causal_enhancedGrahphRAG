  "response": "```json\n{\n    \"final_analysis\": \"Folic acid metabolism can be inhibited by several agents. Methotrexate is a well-known inhibitor of dihydrofolate reductase, an enzyme critical in the folic acid pathway. Trimethoprim also inhibits dihydrofolate reductase, though it is more selective for bacterial enzymes. Nitrous oxide can inactivate vitamin B12, indirectly affecting folate metabolism. Sulfonamides inhibit bacterial folate synthesis by competing with para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA), but they do not directly inhibit folic acid metabolism in humans. 5-Flucytosine is an antifungal that does not directly affect folic acid metabolism. Therefore, the correct options that inhibit folic acid metabolism are Methotrexate, Nitrous oxide, and Trimethoprim.\",\n    \"answer\": \"opa\",\n    \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
