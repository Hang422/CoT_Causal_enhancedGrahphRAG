      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Physiology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Vitamin B12 intrinsic factor absorption occurs in\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Duodenum\nopb. Ileum\nopc. Jejunum\nopd. Colon\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Vitamin B12\" -> \"binds to intrinsic factor\" -> \"travels to ileum\" -> \"absorbed in ileum\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Vitamin B12\" -> \"binds to intrinsic factor\" -> \"passes through duodenum\" -> \"passes through jejunum\" -> \"reaches ileum\" -> \"absorbed in ileum\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Vitamin B12\" -> \"binds to intrinsic factor\" -> \"passes through small intestine\" -> \"reaches ileum\" -> \"absorbed in ileum\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Vitamin B12\" -> \"binds to intrinsic factor\" -> \"passes through duodenum\" -> \"passes through jejunum\" -> \"reaches ileum\" -> \"absorbed in ileum\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Vitamin B12\" -> \"binds to intrinsic factor\" -> \"passes through small intestine\" -> \"reaches ileum\" -> \"absorbed in ileum\" -> 85%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Vitamin B 12)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Pathogenesis)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Intrinsic factor)\n(Vitamin B 12)-PREVENTS->(Inflammation)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Intrinsic factor)\n(Intrinsic factor)-CAUSES->(Immunity)-PROCESS_OF->(ileum)\n(Intrinsic factor)-CAUSES->(uptake)-PROCESS_OF->(ileum)\n(Intrinsic factor)-CAUSES->(Immunity)-PROCESS_OF->(Duodenum)\n(Intrinsic factor)-CAUSES->(uptake)-PROCESS_OF->(Duodenum)\n(Intrinsic factor)-CAUSES->(Transformation, function)-PROCESS_OF->(Duodenum)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Vitamin B12 absorption occurs in the ileum, where it binds to intrinsic factor, a glycoprotein secreted by the stomach's parietal cells. This complex travels through the duodenum and jejunum without being absorbed, reaching the ileum where specific receptors facilitate its uptake. The reasoning chains correctly identify the ileum as the site of absorption, aligning with standard medical consensus. The retrieved evidence paths, while broad, support the role of intrinsic factor in the uptake process occurring in the ileum. Other paths mentioning the duodenum are not directly relevant to the absorption process of Vitamin B12, as absorption does not occur there. Therefore, the correct answer is that Vitamin B12 intrinsic factor absorption occurs in the ileum.\"\n}\n```",
