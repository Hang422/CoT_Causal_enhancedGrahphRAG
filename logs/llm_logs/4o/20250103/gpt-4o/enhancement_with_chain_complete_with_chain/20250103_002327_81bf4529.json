Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        A 40 year old male patient complains of diminished vision during night and dryness of eyes. Patient gives history of recurrent bacterial infections. Ophthalmic examination reveals white triangular plaques on conjunctiva. This patient is suffering from deficiency of:\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Vitamin D\nopb. Vitamin B\nopc. Vitamin A\nopd. Vitamin C\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Night vision problems\" -> \"Vitamin A deficiency\" -> \"Decreased rhodopsin production\" -> \"Night blindness\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Dryness of eyes\" -> \"Vitamin A deficiency\" -> \"Decreased tear production\" -> \"Dry eyes\" -> 80%\nCHAIN: \"Recurrent bacterial infections\" -> \"Vitamin A deficiency\" -> \"Impaired immune function\" -> \"Increased infection risk\" -> 75%\nCHAIN: \"White triangular plaques on conjunctiva\" -> \"Bitot's spots\" -> \"Vitamin A deficiency\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Vitamin A deficiency\" -> \"Epithelial cell dysfunction\" -> \"Dry eyes and Bitot's spots\" -> 85%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Eye)-LOCATION_OF->(Vitamin A Deficiency)\n(Bacterial Infections)-CAUSES->(Disease)-CAUSES->(Vitamin A Deficiency)\n(Bacterial Infections)-CAUSES->(Infection)-CAUSES->(Vitamin A Deficiency)\n(Vitamin A Deficiency)-PREDISPOSES->(Pathogenesis)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Rhodopsin)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"The symptoms presented by the patient, including night vision problems, dryness of eyes, recurrent bacterial infections, and the presence of white triangular plaques on the conjunctiva (Bitot's spots), are indicative of Vitamin A deficiency. Vitamin A is crucial for the production of rhodopsin, a pigment necessary for low-light vision, explaining the night blindness. It also plays a role in maintaining healthy epithelial tissues, which is why its deficiency leads to dry eyes and Bitot's spots. Additionally, Vitamin A is important for immune function, and its deficiency can impair immune responses, leading to increased susceptibility to infections. The retrieved evidence paths support these points by linking Vitamin A deficiency to eye health, immune function, and rhodopsin production, confirming the consensus that the patient is suffering from Vitamin A deficiency.\"\n}\n```",
