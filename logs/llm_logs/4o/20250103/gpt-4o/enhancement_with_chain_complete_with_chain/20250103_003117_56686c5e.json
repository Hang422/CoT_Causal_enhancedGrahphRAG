      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Valproic acid causes all EXCEPT\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. It is an enzyme inducer\nopb. It causes obesity\nopc. It causes Hirsutism\nopd. It causes neural tube defects\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Valproic acid\" -> \"enzyme inhibitor\" -> \"not an enzyme inducer\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Valproic acid\" -> \"weight gain\" -> \"obesity\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Valproic acid\" -> \"hormonal changes\" -> \"possible hirsutism\" -> 60%\nCHAIN: \"Valproic acid\" -> \"teratogenic effects\" -> \"neural tube defects\" -> 90%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Valproic Acid)-CAUSES->(Teratogenesis)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Valproic acid is known to be an enzyme inhibitor, not an inducer, which aligns with the consensus that it does not induce enzymes. It is associated with weight gain, which can lead to obesity, supporting the claim that it causes obesity. While valproic acid can cause hormonal changes, hirsutism is not a well-documented side effect, making this claim less supported. Valproic acid is a known teratogen and is associated with neural tube defects, as confirmed by the evidence path indicating its teratogenic effects. Therefore, the correct answer is that valproic acid does not cause enzyme induction.\"\n}\n```",
