      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        A 9-year-old boy diagnosed as uncomplicated pulmonary tuberculosis. He is put on isoniazid, rifampin, and ethambutol at home after initial treatment given at hospital. Which is accurate statement for this scenario?\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. His 3-year-old sibling should receive INH prophylaxis\nopb. A baseline test of auditory function test is essential before drug treatment is initiated\nopc. Polyahralgia is a potential adverse effect of the drugs the boy is taking\nopd. His mother, who takes care of him, does not need INH prophylaxis\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"3-year-old sibling\" -> \"close contact with TB patient\" -> \"high risk of TB infection\" -> \"INH prophylaxis recommended\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Isoniazid\" -> \"peripheral neuropathy\" -> \"not auditory function\" -> \"auditory test not essential\" -> 70%\nCHAIN: \"Rifampin\" -> \"polyarthralgia\" -> \"possible adverse effect\" -> 60%\nCHAIN: \"Mother\" -> \"close contact with TB patient\" -> \"risk of TB infection\" -> \"INH prophylaxis recommended\" -> 85%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(isoniazid)-TREATS->(Peripheral Neuropathy)\n(Polyarthralgia)-CAUSES->(Lupus Erythematosus, Systemic)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Disease)-CAUSES->(Adverse reactions)\n(Polyarthralgia)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Infection)-CAUSES->(Disease)-CAUSES->(Adverse reactions)\n(Peripheral Neuropathy)-CAUSES->(Functional disorder)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Hearing)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"For option opa, the 3-year-old sibling of a TB patient is at high risk of infection and should receive INH prophylaxis, aligning with standard TB prevention guidelines. For option opb, isoniazid is associated with peripheral neuropathy, not auditory issues, so a baseline auditory function test is not essential before treatment. For option opc, while rifampin can cause various adverse effects, polyarthralgia is not a common or well-documented side effect, making this option less accurate. For option opd, the mother, as a close contact, is at risk of TB infection and should also receive INH prophylaxis, contradicting the statement that she does not need it. Therefore, the most accurate statement is that the 3-year-old sibling should receive INH prophylaxis.\"\n}\n```",
