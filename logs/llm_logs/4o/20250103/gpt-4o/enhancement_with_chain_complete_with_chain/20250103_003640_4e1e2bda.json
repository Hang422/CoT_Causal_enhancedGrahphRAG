      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Physiology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Seoli cell secrets\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Androgen binding protein\nopb. Testosterone\nopc. LH\nopd. FSH\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Sertoli cells\" -> \"secrete androgen binding protein\" -> \"bind testosterone\" -> \"maintain high testosterone levels in seminiferous tubules\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Sertoli cells\" -> \"do not secrete testosterone\" -> \"testosterone produced by Leydig cells\" -> 10%\nCHAIN: \"Sertoli cells\" -> \"respond to FSH\" -> \"support spermatogenesis\" -> \"do not secrete FSH\" -> 20%\nCHAIN: \"Sertoli cells\" -> \"do not secrete LH\" -> \"LH acts on Leydig cells\" -> \"stimulate testosterone production\" -> 10%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Androgen-Binding Proteins)-Binding Proteins)->(Germ Cells)-INTERACTS_WITH/LOCATION_OF->(Testosterone)\n(Luteinizing Hormone)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Testosterone)\n(Structure of sertoli cell)-INTERACTS_WITH/LOCATION_OF->(Testosterone)\n(Testosterone)-INTERACTS_WITH/PART_OF->(Structure of interstitial cell of Leydig)\n(Structure of sertoli cell)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Luteinizing Hormone)\n(Luteinizing Hormone)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Structure of interstitial cell of Leydig)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Sertoli cells are known to secrete androgen-binding protein (ABP), which binds testosterone to maintain high levels in the seminiferous tubules, supporting spermatogenesis. This aligns with the consensus that Sertoli cells do not secrete testosterone, as testosterone is produced by Leydig cells under the stimulation of LH. Sertoli cells respond to FSH, which supports spermatogenesis, but they do not secrete FSH or LH. The evidence paths confirm that androgen-binding proteins interact with testosterone, and LH interacts with Leydig cells to stimulate testosterone production, supporting the consensus that Sertoli cells secrete ABP but not testosterone, FSH, or LH.\"\n}\n```",
