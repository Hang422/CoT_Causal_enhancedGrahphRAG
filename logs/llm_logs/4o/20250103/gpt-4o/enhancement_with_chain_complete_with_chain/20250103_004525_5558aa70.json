      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Depression is not a side effect of\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Propanolol\nopb. Oral contraceptives\nopc. Reserpine\nopd. Flupenthixol\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Propanolol\" -> \"beta-blocker\" -> \"central nervous system effects\" -> \"possible depression\" -> 70%\nCHAIN: \"Oral contraceptives\" -> \"hormonal changes\" -> \"mood alterations\" -> \"possible depression\" -> 60%\nCHAIN: \"Reserpine\" -> \"depletion of monoamines\" -> \"decreased serotonin\" -> \"depression\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Flupenthixol\" -> \"antipsychotic\" -> \"dopamine receptor antagonist\" -> \"improved mood\" -> \"not associated with depression\" -> 80%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Propranolol)-INTERACTS_WITH/ISA->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Adrenergic beta-Antagonists)-Antagonists)\n(Flupenthixol)-INTERACTS_WITH->(MAPT)-INTERACTS_WITH/PART_OF->(Cells)-LOCATION_OF->(Antipsychotic Agents)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Propranolol, a beta-blocker, is known to have central nervous system effects, including the potential to cause depression, aligning with the consensus that beta-blockers can affect mood. Oral contraceptives can lead to hormonal changes that may result in mood alterations, including depression, which is consistent with known side effects. Reserpine depletes monoamines such as serotonin, which is strongly associated with causing depression, supporting the consensus. Flupenthixol, an antipsychotic, acts as a dopamine receptor antagonist and is generally used to improve mood in depressive disorders, and is not typically associated with causing depression. Therefore, Flupenthixol is the option least associated with depression as a side effect.\"\n}\n```",
