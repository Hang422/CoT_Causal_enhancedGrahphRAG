      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Physiology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Which of the following is not carried in dorsal column of spinal cord:March 2011\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Proprioception\nopb. Vibratory sense\nopc. Heat sensation\nopd. Touch\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Proprioception\" -> \"dorsal column\" -> \"carried\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Vibratory sense\" -> \"dorsal column\" -> \"carried\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Heat sensation\" -> \"spinothalamic tract\" -> \"not dorsal column\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Touch\" -> \"dorsal column\" -> \"carried\" -> 90%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Therapeutic tactile stimulation)-CAUSES->(Complication)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(IMPACT gene)-PART_OF->(Dorsal funiculus)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"The dorsal column of the spinal cord is responsible for carrying proprioception, vibratory sense, and fine touch. These modalities are transmitted via the dorsal column-medial lemniscus pathway. Heat sensation, however, is carried by the spinothalamic tract, not the dorsal column. Therefore, the correct answer is that 'Heat sensation' is not carried in the dorsal column. The retrieved evidence path, while broad, does not directly address the specific sensory modalities carried by the dorsal column and is not relevant to the question.\"\n}\n```",
