      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        All of the following are true about loop diuretics except:\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. They are called as \"high ceiling\" diuretics\nopb. They act on Na+.K+.2Cl- symporter\nopc. They can cause hyperuricemia\nopd. Loop diuretics lead to hypercalcemia and hypomagnesimia\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Loop diuretics\" -> \"high ceiling effect\" -> \"increased diuresis\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Loop diuretics\" -> \"act on Na+.K+.2Cl- symporter\" -> \"inhibit reabsorption of Na+, K+, Cl-\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Loop diuretics\" -> \"increased uric acid reabsorption\" -> \"hyperuricemia\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Loop diuretics\" -> \"increased calcium excretion\" -> \"hypocalcemia\" -> \"possible\" -> 60%\nCHAIN: \"Loop diuretics\" -> \"increased magnesium excretion\" -> \"hypomagnesemia\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Loop diuretics\" -> \"increased calcium excretion\" -> \"hypocalcemia\" -> \"conflicts with hypercalcemia\" -> 70%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(calcium)-CAUSES->(Hypocalcemia)\n(Loop Diuretics)-TREATS->(Complication)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(calcium)\n(Loop Diuretics)-CAUSES->(Excretory function)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(calcium)\n(Hypocalcemia)-CAUSES->(Disease)-CAUSES->(Hypercalcemia)\n(Hypocalcemia)-CAUSES->(Symptoms)-CAUSES->(Hypercalcemia)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Loop diuretics are known as 'high ceiling' diuretics due to their potent diuretic effect, which aligns with the consensus that they significantly increase urine output (Option A is true). They act on the Na+.K+.2Cl- symporter in the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle, inhibiting the reabsorption of sodium, potassium, and chloride ions, which is a well-established mechanism (Option B is true). Loop diuretics can cause hyperuricemia by increasing uric acid reabsorption, which is a recognized side effect (Option C is true). However, loop diuretics increase the excretion of calcium, leading to hypocalcemia, not hypercalcemia. They also increase magnesium excretion, leading to hypomagnesemia. Therefore, the statement that loop diuretics lead to hypercalcemia is incorrect (Option D is false). The retrieved evidence paths support the understanding that loop diuretics are associated with increased calcium excretion, which can lead to hypocalcemia, contradicting the claim of hypercalcemia.\"\n}\n```",
