      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        A 54-year-old man is brought to the emergency after experiencing several syncopal episodes. The patient states that he is currently taking erythromycin for treatment of bronchitis and another medication for treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). If an electrocardiogram reveals torsades de pointes, the patient is most likely taking which of the following medications for treatment of his reflux disease?\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Cisapride\nopb. Famotidine\nopc. Lansoprazole\nopd. Metoclopramide\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Erythromycin\" -> \"inhibits CYP3A4\" -> \"increased cisapride levels\" -> \"prolonged QT interval\" -> \"torsades de pointes\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Erythromycin\" -> \"drug interaction with cisapride\" -> \"cardiac arrhythmia risk\" -> \"torsades de pointes\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Cisapride\" -> \"prolongs QT interval\" -> \"risk of torsades de pointes\" -> \"exacerbated by erythromycin\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Cisapride\" -> \"known to cause torsades de pointes\" -> \"interaction with erythromycin\" -> \"increased risk of arrhythmia\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Erythromycin\" -> \"increased risk of QT prolongation\" -> \"cisapride use\" -> \"torsades de pointes\" -> 92%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Cisapride)-TREATS->(Disease)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(paracrine)-PROCESS_OF->(Heart)\n(Cisapride)-PREVENTS->(Symptoms)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(voltage gated channel)-PROCESS_OF->(Heart)\n(Cisapride)-TREATS->(Symptoms)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(paracrine)-PROCESS_OF->(Heart)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Cisapride is known to prolong the QT interval, which can lead to torsades de pointes, a type of cardiac arrhythmia. Erythromycin, an antibiotic, inhibits the CYP3A4 enzyme, which is responsible for metabolizing cisapride. This inhibition can lead to increased levels of cisapride in the body, further prolonging the QT interval and increasing the risk of torsades de pointes. The retrieved evidence paths, while broad, support the understanding that cisapride affects cardiac processes, aligning with its known risk of causing torsades de pointes when combined with erythromycin. Therefore, the patient is most likely taking cisapride for his gastroesophageal reflux disease, which, in combination with erythromycin, has led to the observed cardiac arrhythmia.\"\n}\n```",
