      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Drug indicated in case of subarachnoid hemorrhage:\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Nimodipine\nopb. Amlodipine\nopc. Diltiazem\nopd. Verapamil\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Nimodipine\" -> \"calcium channel blocker\" -> \"vasodilation\" -> \"reduced cerebral vasospasm\" -> \"improved outcomes in subarachnoid hemorrhage\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Amlodipine\" -> \"calcium channel blocker\" -> \"systemic vasodilation\" -> \"lower blood pressure\" -> \"not specific for cerebral vasospasm\" -> 40%\nCHAIN: \"Diltiazem\" -> \"calcium channel blocker\" -> \"systemic vasodilation\" -> \"lower blood pressure\" -> \"not specific for cerebral vasospasm\" -> 40%\nCHAIN: \"Verapamil\" -> \"calcium channel blocker\" -> \"systemic vasodilation\" -> \"lower blood pressure\" -> \"not specific for cerebral vasospasm\" -> 40%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Amlodipine)-ISA->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Calcium Channel Blockers)\n(Diltiazem)-ISA->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Calcium Channel Blockers)\n(Verapamil)-ISA->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Calcium Channel Blockers)\n(Nimodipine)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Antioxidants)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Calcium Channel Blockers)\n(Nimodipine)-CAUSES->(Vasodilation)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Calcium Channel Blockers)\n(Amlodipine)-ISA->(Antihypertensive Agents)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Calcium Channel Blockers)\n(Diltiazem)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cells)-LOCATION_OF->(Calcium Channel Blockers)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Nimodipine is a calcium channel blocker specifically indicated for the treatment of subarachnoid hemorrhage due to its ability to cause vasodilation and reduce cerebral vasospasm, which improves outcomes in this condition. This aligns with the consensus that nimodipine is used to prevent cerebral vasospasm following subarachnoid hemorrhage. The evidence path supports this by showing nimodipine's interaction with calcium channel blockers and its role in vasodilation. In contrast, amlodipine, diltiazem, and verapamil, while also calcium channel blockers, primarily cause systemic vasodilation and lower blood pressure, and are not specifically indicated for cerebral vasospasm in subarachnoid hemorrhage. The retrieved evidence paths confirm their classification as calcium channel blockers but do not provide specific support for their use in subarachnoid hemorrhage, aligning with the consensus that they are not the preferred treatment in this context.\"\n}\n```",
