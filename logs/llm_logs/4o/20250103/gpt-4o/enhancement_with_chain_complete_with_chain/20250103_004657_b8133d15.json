      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Biochemistry.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        All the following are features of Cardiac muscle Except\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Striated\nopb. Large T tubules\nopc. Troponin system present\nopd. Caldesmon is impoant regulatory protein\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Cardiac muscle\" -> \"striated appearance\" -> \"similar to skeletal muscle\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Cardiac muscle\" -> \"large T tubules\" -> \"efficient calcium handling\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Cardiac muscle\" -> \"troponin system present\" -> \"regulation of contraction\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Cardiac muscle\" -> \"caldesmon as important regulatory protein\" -> \"possible conflict with known cardiac muscle regulation\" -> 70%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Myocardium)-PART_OF->(Aorta)-LOCATION_OF->(Caldesmon)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Cardiac muscle is characterized by a striated appearance, similar to skeletal muscle, due to the arrangement of actin and myosin filaments, which is a consensus fact. It also features large T tubules that facilitate efficient calcium handling, crucial for cardiac muscle contraction. The presence of the troponin system in cardiac muscle is well-established, as it plays a key role in the regulation of contraction by binding calcium ions. However, caldesmon is not an important regulatory protein in cardiac muscle; it is more relevant in smooth muscle regulation. The retrieved evidence path mentioning caldesmon in relation to the myocardium is misleading in this context, as it does not apply to cardiac muscle regulation. Therefore, the correct answer is that caldesmon is not a feature of cardiac muscle.\"\n}\n```",
