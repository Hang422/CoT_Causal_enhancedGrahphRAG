      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        L-Dopa is combined with carbidopa in the treatment of parkinsonism to -\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Decrease the efficacy of levodopa\nopb. Decrease the efficacy of levodopa\nopc. Increase the dose of levodopa required\nopd. Inhibit conversion of levodopa to dopamine in the CNS\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"L-Dopa\" -> \"converted to dopamine in periphery\" -> \"reduced availability in CNS\" -> \"carbidopa inhibits peripheral conversion\" -> \"increased L-Dopa in CNS\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"L-Dopa\" -> \"converted to dopamine in periphery\" -> \"side effects due to peripheral dopamine\" -> \"carbidopa inhibits peripheral conversion\" -> \"reduced side effects\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"L-Dopa\" -> \"requires conversion to dopamine in CNS\" -> \"carbidopa does not cross blood-brain barrier\" -> \"no inhibition of CNS conversion\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"L-Dopa\" -> \"increased dopamine in CNS\" -> \"improved motor symptoms in Parkinson's\" -> \"carbidopa enhances CNS availability\" -> 90%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Carbidopa)-TREATS->(MOTOR DEFICIT)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Levodopa)\n(Levodopa)-INTERACTS_WITH/ISA->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Dopamine)\n(Carbidopa)-TREATS->(Complication)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Levodopa)\n(Dopamine)-TREATS->(Adverse effects)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Carbidopa)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"L-Dopa is combined with carbidopa in the treatment of Parkinson's disease to inhibit the peripheral conversion of L-Dopa to dopamine. This increases the availability of L-Dopa in the central nervous system (CNS), where it is needed to be converted to dopamine to exert its therapeutic effects. Carbidopa does not cross the blood-brain barrier, so it does not inhibit the conversion of L-Dopa to dopamine in the CNS. By preventing peripheral conversion, carbidopa reduces peripheral side effects associated with dopamine and enhances the efficacy of L-Dopa in treating motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease. The evidence paths support this by showing carbidopa's role in treating motor deficits and complications associated with levodopa, confirming its function in enhancing CNS availability of dopamine without affecting CNS conversion.\"\n}\n```",
