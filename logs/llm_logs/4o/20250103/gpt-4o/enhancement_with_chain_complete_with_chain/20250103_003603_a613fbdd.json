      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Physiology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Enzymatic markers of plasma membrane include all except\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. 5'-nucleotidase\nopb. Adenylyl cyclase\nopc. Na+-K+-ATPase\nopd. Galactosyl transferase\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"5'-nucleotidase\" -> \"plasma membrane localization\" -> \"marker for plasma membrane\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Adenylyl cyclase\" -> \"plasma membrane localization\" -> \"marker for plasma membrane\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Na+-K+-ATPase\" -> \"plasma membrane localization\" -> \"marker for plasma membrane\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Galactosyl transferase\" -> \"Golgi apparatus localization\" -> \"not a marker for plasma membrane\" -> 95%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Golgi Apparatus)-PART_OF->(Cell membrane)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Enzymatic markers of the plasma membrane typically include enzymes that are localized to or function at the plasma membrane. 5'-nucleotidase, adenylyl cyclase, and Na+-K+-ATPase are all well-established markers of the plasma membrane due to their roles and localization. 5'-nucleotidase is involved in nucleotide metabolism at the cell surface, adenylyl cyclase is a key enzyme in signal transduction pathways at the plasma membrane, and Na+-K+-ATPase is crucial for maintaining ion gradients across the plasma membrane. In contrast, galactosyl transferase is primarily localized to the Golgi apparatus, where it functions in glycosylation processes, and is not considered a marker for the plasma membrane. The evidence path indicating the Golgi apparatus as part of the cell membrane is too broad and does not specifically support galactosyl transferase as a plasma membrane marker. Therefore, the correct answer is that galactosyl transferase is not a marker for the plasma membrane.\"\n}\n```",
