      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Aspirin is contraindicated in?\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Fever\nopb. Peptic ulcer\nopc. Unstable angina\nopd. Myalgia\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Aspirin\" -> \"inhibits prostaglandins\" -> \"reduces gastric mucosal protection\" -> \"increased risk of gastric bleeding\" -> \"peptic ulcer exacerbation\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Aspirin\" -> \"antiplatelet effect\" -> \"increased bleeding risk\" -> \"peptic ulcer bleeding\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Aspirin\" -> \"antipyretic effect\" -> \"reduces fever\" -> \"fever management\" -> 60%\nCHAIN: \"Aspirin\" -> \"anti-inflammatory effect\" -> \"reduces myalgia\" -> \"myalgia management\" -> 70%\nCHAIN: \"Aspirin\" -> \"antiplatelet effect\" -> \"prevents clot formation\" -> \"beneficial in unstable angina\" -> 80%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Aspirin)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Prostaglandins)\n(Aspirin)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Pathogenesis)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Prostaglandins)\n(Aspirin)-INTERACTS_WITH/ISA->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Antiplatelet)\n(Antipyretic Effect)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Interleukin-1 beta)-1 beta)->(Fever)\n(Clot formation)-DIAGNOSES->(Diabetes)-COMPLICATES/PREDISPOSES->(Unstable angina)\n(Gastric hemorrhage)-CAUSES->(Gastric ulcer)-CAUSES->(Peptic Ulcer)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Aspirin is contraindicated in peptic ulcer disease due to its inhibition of prostaglandins, which reduces gastric mucosal protection and increases the risk of gastric bleeding. This aligns with the evidence path showing aspirin's interaction with prostaglandins and its association with gastric ulcer pathogenesis. Aspirin's antiplatelet effect further increases bleeding risk, exacerbating peptic ulcer conditions. While aspirin has antipyretic and anti-inflammatory effects beneficial for fever and myalgia management, and its antiplatelet effect is beneficial in unstable angina by preventing clot formation, these do not contraindicate its use in these conditions. Therefore, the primary contraindication is in peptic ulcer disease.\"\n}\n```",
