      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Which of the following drugs is contraindicated along with spironolactone\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Chlorothiazide\nopb. Beta blockers\nopc. ACE inhibitors\nopd. Amlodipine\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Spironolactone\" -> \"potassium retention\" -> \"increased potassium levels\" -> \"ACE inhibitors\" -> \"further increase potassium\" -> \"risk of hyperkalemia\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Spironolactone\" -> \"potassium retention\" -> \"increased potassium levels\" -> \"Chlorothiazide\" -> \"potassium excretion\" -> \"possible balance of potassium\" -> 70%\nCHAIN: \"Spironolactone\" -> \"potassium retention\" -> \"increased potassium levels\" -> \"Beta blockers\" -> \"no direct effect on potassium\" -> \"no significant interaction\" -> 80%\nCHAIN: \"Spironolactone\" -> \"potassium retention\" -> \"increased potassium levels\" -> \"Amlodipine\" -> \"no direct effect on potassium\" -> \"no significant interaction\" -> 80%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Spironolactone)-CAUSES->(Potassium retention)\n(Serum potassium assay)-DIAGNOSES->(Disease)-CAUSES->(Obstetric Labor, Premature)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Amlodipine)\n(Serum potassium assay)-DIAGNOSES->(Asthma)-PREDISPOSES->(Obstetric Labor, Premature)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Amlodipine)\n(Amlodipine)-TREATS->(Disease)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Excretory function)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(potassium)\n(Amlodipine)-TREATS->(Disease)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(physiological aspects)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(potassium)\n(Serum potassium assay)-DIAGNOSES->(Disease)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Virus)-LOCATION_OF->(Hormones)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Chlorothiazide)\n(Serum potassium assay)-DIAGNOSES->(Kidney Failure, Chronic)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Virus)-LOCATION_OF->(Hormones)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Chlorothiazide)\n(potassium)-CAUSES->(Hypertensive disease)-CAUSES->(hyperkalemia)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Spironolactone is a potassium-sparing diuretic that can lead to increased potassium levels, posing a risk of hyperkalemia. ACE inhibitors also increase potassium levels, and their concurrent use with spironolactone is contraindicated due to the significant risk of hyperkalemia. Chlorothiazide, a thiazide diuretic, promotes potassium excretion and may counteract spironolactone's potassium retention, but it is not contraindicated. Beta blockers and amlodipine do not have a direct effect on potassium levels and are not contraindicated with spironolactone. The evidence paths confirm spironolactone's role in potassium retention and the risk of hyperkalemia, supporting the contraindication with ACE inhibitors.\"\n}\n```",
