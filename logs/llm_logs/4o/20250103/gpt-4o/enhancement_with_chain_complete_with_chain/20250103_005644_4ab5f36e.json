      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        The 5α reductase inhibitor that has been found to be effective both in benign prostatic hypertrophy and male pattern baldness is:\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Flutamide\nopb. Finasteride\nopc. Prazosin\nopd. Minoxidil\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Finasteride\" -> \"5α reductase inhibition\" -> \"decreased dihydrotestosterone (DHT)\" -> \"reduced prostate size\" -> \"improved benign prostatic hypertrophy symptoms\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Finasteride\" -> \"5α reductase inhibition\" -> \"decreased dihydrotestosterone (DHT)\" -> \"reduced hair follicle miniaturization\" -> \"improved male pattern baldness\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Flutamide\" -> \"androgen receptor blockade\" -> \"reduced androgen effects\" -> \"possible effect on prostate\" -> \"unclear effect on hair\" -> 40%\nCHAIN: \"Prazosin\" -> \"alpha-1 adrenergic receptor blockade\" -> \"relaxation of smooth muscle\" -> \"improved urinary symptoms in benign prostatic hypertrophy\" -> \"no effect on hair\" -> 50%\nCHAIN: \"Minoxidil\" -> \"vasodilation\" -> \"increased blood flow to hair follicles\" -> \"improved male pattern baldness\" -> \"no effect on prostate\" -> 60%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Minoxidil)-TREATS->(Hypertensive disease)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Vasodilation)\n(Prazosin)-TREATS->(Hypoxia)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Receptors, Adrenergic, alpha-1)\n(Stanolone)-CAUSES->(uptake)-PROCESS_OF->(Hair follicle structure)\n(Stanolone)-CAUSES->(paracrine)-PROCESS_OF->(Hair follicle structure)\n(Minoxidil)-TREATS->(Adverse effects)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Vasodilation)\n(Minoxidil)-PREVENTS->(Pain)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Vasodilation)\n(Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia)-PREDISPOSES->(Disease)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Human Development)-PROCESS_OF->(hair)\n(Androgenetic Alopecia)-CAUSES->(Inflammatory Response)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(paracrine)-PROCESS_OF->(Prostate)\n(Hair follicle structure)-LOCATION_OF->(Androgenetic Alopecia)\n(Blood Circulation)-PROCESS_OF->(Pancreas)-CAUSES->(Pancreatitis)-CAUSES->(Chronic inflammation)-CAUSES->(Androgenetic Alopecia)\n(Blood Circulation)-PROCESS_OF->(Pancreas)-CAUSES->(Pancreatitis)-CAUSES->(Inflammation)-CAUSES->(Androgenetic Alopecia)\n(Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia)-CAUSES->(Obstruction)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Physiologic Function)-PROCESS_OF->(hair)\n(Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia)-CAUSES->(Obstruction)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Musculoskeletal torsion, function)-PROCESS_OF->(hair)\n(Androgenetic Alopecia)-CAUSES->(Disease)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(paracrine)-PROCESS_OF->(Prostate)\n(Androgenetic Alopecia)-CAUSES->(Metabolic Diseases)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(paracrine)-PROCESS_OF->(Prostate)\n(Blood Circulation)-PROCESS_OF->(Pancreas)-CAUSES->(Pancreatitis)-CAUSES->(Disease)-CAUSES->(Androgenetic Alopecia)\n(Relaxation)-CAUSES->(Disease)-CAUSES->(Urinary symptoms)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Finasteride is a 5α reductase inhibitor that effectively reduces dihydrotestosterone (DHT) levels, leading to decreased prostate size and improved symptoms of benign prostatic hypertrophy, as well as reduced hair follicle miniaturization, which improves male pattern baldness. This aligns with standard medical consensus. Flutamide, an androgen receptor blocker, does not have a clear effect on hair and is not primarily used for benign prostatic hypertrophy. Prazosin, an alpha-1 adrenergic receptor blocker, improves urinary symptoms in benign prostatic hypertrophy but does not affect hair. Minoxidil, a vasodilator, increases blood flow to hair follicles and improves male pattern baldness but has no effect on the prostate. The evidence paths confirm the mechanisms of action for Minoxidil and Prazosin but do not directly support their use for both conditions, unlike Finasteride.\"\n}\n```",
