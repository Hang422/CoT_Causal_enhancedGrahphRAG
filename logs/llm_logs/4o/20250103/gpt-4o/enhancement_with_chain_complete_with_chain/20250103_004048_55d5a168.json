      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Physiology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Plasma membrane of cell is bounded to cytoskeleton by which of the following?\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Spectrin\nopb. Ankyrin\nopc. Tubulin\nopd. Laminin\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Spectrin\" -> \"cytoskeletal protein\" -> \"binds to plasma membrane\" -> \"stabilizes cell shape\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Ankyrin\" -> \"anchors spectrin to plasma membrane\" -> \"connects cytoskeleton to membrane proteins\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Tubulin\" -> \"microtubule component\" -> \"not directly binding plasma membrane\" -> \"possible indirect role\" -> 60%\nCHAIN: \"Laminin\" -> \"extracellular matrix protein\" -> \"not directly involved in cytoskeleton binding\" -> \"unclear role in plasma membrane binding\" -> 50%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Cell membrane)-PART_OF->(Cells)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Membrane Proteins)\n(Ankyrins)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cells)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Spectrin)\n(Cell membrane)-PART_OF->(Erythroblasts)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Membrane Proteins)\n(Spectrin)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cells)-INTERACTS_WITH/LOCATION_OF->(Cytoskeletal Proteins)\n(Ankyrins)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Erythrocytes)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Spectrin)\n(Spectrin)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cells)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Membrane Proteins)\n(Laminin)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cells)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Extracellular Matrix Proteins)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"The plasma membrane of a cell is connected to the cytoskeleton primarily through the interaction of spectrin and ankyrin. Spectrin is a cytoskeletal protein that binds to the plasma membrane, helping to stabilize cell shape. Ankyrin acts as an anchor, connecting spectrin to membrane proteins, thereby linking the cytoskeleton to the plasma membrane. This interaction is well-supported by evidence showing that ankyrin interacts with spectrin in cells, particularly erythrocytes. Tubulin, while a component of microtubules, does not directly bind to the plasma membrane, and its role is more structural within the cytoskeleton itself. Laminin is an extracellular matrix protein and does not directly participate in binding the cytoskeleton to the plasma membrane. Therefore, the most accurate answer is that ankyrin facilitates the connection between the plasma membrane and the cytoskeleton by anchoring spectrin.\"\n}\n```",
