      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Physiology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Adrenal insufficiency in not associated with -\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Hyponatremia\nopb. Hyperkalemia\nopc. Hypoglycemia\nopd. Metabolic alkalosis\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Adrenal insufficiency\" -> \"decreased aldosterone\" -> \"decreased sodium reabsorption\" -> \"hyponatremia\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Adrenal insufficiency\" -> \"decreased aldosterone\" -> \"decreased potassium excretion\" -> \"hyperkalemia\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Adrenal insufficiency\" -> \"decreased cortisol\" -> \"decreased gluconeogenesis\" -> \"hypoglycemia\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Adrenal insufficiency\" -> \"decreased aldosterone\" -> \"decreased hydrogen ion excretion\" -> \"metabolic acidosis\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Adrenal insufficiency\" -> \"decreased aldosterone\" -> \"possible metabolic acidosis\" -> \"not metabolic alkalosis\" -> 90%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(potassium)-CAUSES->(Hypertensive disease)-CAUSES->(hyperkalemia)\n(potassium)-TREATS->(Kidney Diseases)-CAUSES->(hyperkalemia)\n(potassium)-TREATS->(Diabetic Ketoacidosis)-CAUSES->(hyperkalemia)\n(Metabolic acidosis)-CAUSES->(Disease)-CAUSES->(Metabolic alkalosis)\n(Metabolic acidosis)-CAUSES->(Syndrome)-CAUSES->(Metabolic alkalosis)\n(Metabolic acidosis)-CAUSES->(Hypercalcemia)-CAUSES->(Metabolic alkalosis)\n(Excretory function)-PROCESS_OF->(Pancreas)-CAUSES->(Pancreatitis)-CAUSES->(Disease)-CAUSES->(hyperkalemia)\n(Excretory function)-PROCESS_OF->(Pancreas)-CAUSES->(Pancreatitis)-CAUSES->(Hypertensive disease)-CAUSES->(hyperkalemia)\n(Aldosterone)-CAUSES->(Disease)-PREDISPOSES->(Metabolic acidosis)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Adrenal insufficiency is characterized by decreased production of aldosterone and cortisol. This leads to hyponatremia due to decreased sodium reabsorption and hyperkalemia due to decreased potassium excretion, both of which are consistent with standard medical consensus. Additionally, decreased cortisol results in reduced gluconeogenesis, causing hypoglycemia. Metabolic acidosis, not alkalosis, is associated with adrenal insufficiency due to decreased hydrogen ion excretion. The evidence paths related to hyperkalemia and metabolic acidosis support these points, confirming that metabolic alkalosis is not associated with adrenal insufficiency.\"\n}\n```",
