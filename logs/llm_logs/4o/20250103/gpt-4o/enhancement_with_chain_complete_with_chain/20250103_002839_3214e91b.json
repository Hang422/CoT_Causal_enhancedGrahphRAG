      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Which of the following most often causes cholestatic jaundice:\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. INH\nopb. Erythromycin estolate\nopc. Pyrazinamide\nopd. Ethionamide\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Erythromycin estolate\" -> \"liver enzyme inhibition\" -> \"impaired bile flow\" -> \"cholestatic jaundice\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"INH\" -> \"liver enzyme alteration\" -> \"hepatitis\" -> \"possible jaundice\" -> 60%\nCHAIN: \"Pyrazinamide\" -> \"liver toxicity\" -> \"hepatitis\" -> \"possible jaundice\" -> 55%\nCHAIN: \"Ethionamide\" -> \"liver enzyme alteration\" -> \"hepatitis\" -> \"possible jaundice\" -> 50%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Pyrazinamide)-TREATS->(Disease)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(paracrine)-PROCESS_OF->(Liver)\n(Pyrazinamide)-TREATS->(Obesity)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(paracrine)-PROCESS_OF->(Liver)\n(isoniazid)-PREVENTS/TREATS->(Complication)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Liver enzyme)\n(Ethionamide)-PREVENTS->(Complication)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Liver enzyme)\n(Pyrazinamide)-PREVENTS->(Complication)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Biological Transport, Active)-PROCESS_OF->(Liver)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Cholestatic jaundice is most commonly associated with the use of erythromycin estolate. This is due to its potential to cause liver enzyme inhibition, leading to impaired bile flow and resulting in cholestatic jaundice. This aligns with the consensus that erythromycin estolate is a well-known cause of this condition. In contrast, INH (isoniazid), pyrazinamide, and ethionamide are more commonly associated with hepatocellular damage and hepatitis, which can lead to jaundice but are less frequently linked to cholestatic jaundice specifically. The retrieved evidence paths, while broad, do not contradict this consensus and primarily highlight associations with liver enzyme alterations and liver-related processes, which are more relevant to hepatocellular injury rather than cholestatic jaundice.\"\n}\n```",
