      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Drug the choice for hyperthyroidism in first trimester of pregnancy is\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Methimazole\nopb. Propylthiouraril\nopc. Carbimazole\nopd. Perchlorate\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Methimazole\" -> \"crosses placenta\" -> \"risk of fetal abnormalities\" -> \"not preferred in first trimester\" -> 70%\nCHAIN: \"Propylthiouracil\" -> \"less placental transfer\" -> \"lower risk of fetal abnormalities\" -> \"preferred in first trimester\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Carbimazole\" -> \"metabolized to methimazole\" -> \"similar risks as methimazole\" -> \"not preferred in first trimester\" -> 70%\nCHAIN: \"Perchlorate\" -> \"less commonly used\" -> \"potential for fetal harm\" -> \"not preferred in pregnancy\" -> 60%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Carbimazole)-TREATS->(Disease)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Virus)-LOCATION_OF->(Enzymes)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Methimazole)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"In the management of hyperthyroidism during the first trimester of pregnancy, the standard medical consensus is to prefer Propylthiouracil (PTU) due to its lower placental transfer and reduced risk of fetal abnormalities compared to Methimazole and Carbimazole. Methimazole is associated with a higher risk of fetal abnormalities when used in the first trimester, and Carbimazole is metabolized to Methimazole, thus sharing similar risks. Perchlorate is less commonly used and has potential for fetal harm, making it not preferred in pregnancy. The retrieved evidence path involving Carbimazole and Methimazole confirms the metabolic relationship but does not alter the consensus that PTU is the preferred choice in the first trimester.\"\n}\n```",
