      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Physiology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        The most important action of Secretin is to\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. neutralize the acid from the stomach\nopb. increase secretion of bicarbonates by pancreas\nopc. decrease gastric secretion\nopd. cause contraction of pyloric sphincter\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Secretin\" -> \"stimulates pancreas\" -> \"increased secretion of bicarbonates\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Secretin\" -> \"neutralizes stomach acid\" -> \"possible\" -> 60%\nCHAIN: \"Secretin\" -> \"decreases gastric secretion\" -> \"possible\" -> 50%\nCHAIN: \"Secretin\" -> \"causes contraction of pyloric sphincter\" -> \"unclear\" -> 40%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Secretin)-CAUSES->(fluid secretion)-PROCESS_OF->(Pancreas)\n(Secretin)-CAUSES->(Vasodilation)-PROCESS_OF->(Pancreas)\n(Secretin)-CAUSES->(Excretory function)-PROCESS_OF->(Pancreas)\n(Secretin)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cells)-PART_OF->(Myenteric Plexus)-PART_OF->(Pyloric sphincter structure)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Secretin primarily stimulates the pancreas to increase the secretion of bicarbonate-rich fluid, which is crucial for neutralizing the acidic chyme entering the small intestine from the stomach. This aligns with the consensus that the most important action of secretin is to increase bicarbonate secretion by the pancreas. The evidence paths support this by showing secretin's role in fluid secretion and excretory function of the pancreas. While secretin can also decrease gastric secretion and has some interaction with the pyloric sphincter, these actions are secondary and less significant compared to its role in bicarbonate secretion. Therefore, the most consensus-aligned action of secretin is increasing pancreatic bicarbonate secretion.\"\n}\n```",
