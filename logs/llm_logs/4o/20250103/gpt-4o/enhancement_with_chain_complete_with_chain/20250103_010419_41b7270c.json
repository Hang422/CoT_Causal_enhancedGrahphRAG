      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Gp2b3A inhibitors are all except -\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Abciximab\nopb. Eptifibatide\nopc. Tirofiban\nopd. Prasugrel\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Abciximab\" -> \"Gp2b3A inhibitor\" -> \"correct option\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Eptifibatide\" -> \"Gp2b3A inhibitor\" -> \"correct option\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Tirofiban\" -> \"Gp2b3A inhibitor\" -> \"correct option\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Prasugrel\" -> \"antiplatelet agent\" -> \"not a Gp2b3A inhibitor\" -> \"incorrect option\" -> 95%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(prasugrel)-TREATS->(Complication)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(P2RY12)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Antiplatelet Agents)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Gp2b3A inhibitors are a class of antiplatelet drugs that include Abciximab, Eptifibatide, and Tirofiban. These drugs work by inhibiting the glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor on platelets, preventing platelet aggregation. Prasugrel, on the other hand, is an antiplatelet agent that functions as a P2Y12 receptor inhibitor, not a Gp2b3A inhibitor. The retrieved evidence path supports this by associating Prasugrel with P2Y12 interaction, confirming it is not a Gp2b3A inhibitor. Therefore, the correct answer is that Prasugrel is not a Gp2b3A inhibitor.\"\n}\n```",
