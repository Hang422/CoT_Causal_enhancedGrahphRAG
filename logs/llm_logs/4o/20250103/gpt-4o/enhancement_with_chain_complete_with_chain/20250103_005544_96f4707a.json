      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Use of tamoxifen for breast cancer can cause all ofthe following adverse effects, exceptaEUR'\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. >Thromboembolism\nopb. Endometrial carcinoma\nopc. >Carcinoma in contralateral breast\nopd. >Cataract\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Tamoxifen\" -> \"increased risk of thromboembolism\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Tamoxifen\" -> \"increased risk of endometrial carcinoma\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Tamoxifen\" -> \"possible protective effect on contralateral breast cancer\" -> 70%\nCHAIN: \"Tamoxifen\" -> \"increased risk of cataract\" -> 85%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Tamoxifen)-PREDISPOSES->(Thromboembolism)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Tamoxifen is known to increase the risk of thromboembolism and endometrial carcinoma, which aligns with standard medical consensus and is supported by evidence paths. It also has a known association with an increased risk of cataracts. However, tamoxifen is generally considered to have a protective effect against contralateral breast cancer, rather than increasing the risk. Therefore, the adverse effect not typically associated with tamoxifen use is 'carcinoma in contralateral breast.'\"\n}\n```",
