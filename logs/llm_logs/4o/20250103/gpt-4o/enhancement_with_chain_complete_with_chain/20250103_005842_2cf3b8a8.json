      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        All of the following can be used to treat alcohol dependence except\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Naltrexone\nopb. Acamprosate\nopc. Flumazenil\nopd. Disulfiram\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Naltrexone\" -> \"opioid receptor antagonist\" -> \"reduces alcohol craving\" -> \"treats alcohol dependence\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Acamprosate\" -> \"modulates glutamatergic system\" -> \"reduces alcohol craving\" -> \"treats alcohol dependence\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Flumazenil\" -> \"benzodiazepine receptor antagonist\" -> \"reverses benzodiazepine effects\" -> \"not used for alcohol dependence\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Disulfiram\" -> \"inhibits acetaldehyde dehydrogenase\" -> \"causes unpleasant reaction to alcohol\" -> \"deters alcohol consumption\" -> \"treats alcohol dependence\" -> 90%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Benzodiazepines)-TREATS->(Alcoholic Intoxication, Chronic)\n(Naltrexone)-ISA->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Narcotic Antagonists)\n(Disulfiram)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-PART_OF->(Cells)-LOCATION_OF->(Aldehyde dehydrogenase (NAD(P)+))\n(Disulfiram)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Fenclonine)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cells)-LOCATION_OF->(Aldehyde dehydrogenase (NAD(P)+))\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Naltrexone is an opioid receptor antagonist that reduces alcohol craving and is used to treat alcohol dependence, aligning with consensus. Acamprosate modulates the glutamatergic system to reduce alcohol craving, also used for alcohol dependence. Disulfiram inhibits acetaldehyde dehydrogenase, causing unpleasant reactions to alcohol consumption, thus deterring use and treating alcohol dependence. Flumazenil, a benzodiazepine receptor antagonist, is used to reverse benzodiazepine effects and is not indicated for treating alcohol dependence. The evidence paths confirm the mechanisms of action for Naltrexone and Disulfiram but do not provide relevant support for Flumazenil in the context of alcohol dependence treatment. Therefore, Flumazenil is the exception and not used for treating alcohol dependence.\"\n}\n```",
