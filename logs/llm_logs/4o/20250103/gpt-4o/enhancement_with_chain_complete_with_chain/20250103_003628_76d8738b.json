      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Biochemistry.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        While going for oxidation in the mitochondria, free fatty acid are transpoed by:\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. None of the above\nopb. Albumin\nopc. Globulins\nopd. Chylomicrons\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Free fatty acids\" -> \"bound to albumin in blood\" -> \"transported to cells\" -> \"enter mitochondria for oxidation\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Free fatty acids\" -> \"not transported by globulins\" -> \"globulins primarily transport hormones and vitamins\" -> 10%\nCHAIN: \"Free fatty acids\" -> \"not transported by chylomicrons\" -> \"chylomicrons transport dietary lipids from intestines\" -> 10%\nCHAIN: \"Free fatty acids\" -> \"not transported by none of the above\" -> \"require a carrier in blood\" -> 5%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Fatty Acids, Nonesterified)-PART_OF->(Cells)-LOCATION_OF->(Albumins)\n(Fatty Acids, Nonesterified)-PREDISPOSES->(Diastasis)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Albumins)\n(Fatty Acids, Nonesterified)-PREDISPOSES->(Diastasis)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Globulins)\n(Fatty Acids, Nonesterified)-PART_OF->(Lymphocyte)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Globulins)\n(Fatty Acids, Nonesterified)-PREDISPOSES->(Diastasis)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Chylomicrons)\n(Fatty Acids, Nonesterified)-PART_OF->(Adipocytes)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Chylomicrons)\n(Globulins)-INTERACTS_WITH->(T-Lymphocyte)-LOCATION_OF->(Genes)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Vitamins)\n(Globulins)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cells)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Genes)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Vitamins)\n(Chylomicrons)-CAUSES->(uptake)-PROCESS_OF->(Intestines)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Free fatty acids are transported in the blood bound to albumin, which is a well-established consensus in biochemistry. Albumin acts as a carrier for free fatty acids, facilitating their transport to cells where they can enter mitochondria for oxidation. The retrieved evidence path supports this by indicating that nonesterified fatty acids are associated with albumins. Globulins and chylomicrons do not transport free fatty acids; globulins primarily transport hormones and vitamins, while chylomicrons are involved in the transport of dietary lipids from the intestines. Therefore, the correct option is that free fatty acids are transported by albumin.\"\n}\n```",
