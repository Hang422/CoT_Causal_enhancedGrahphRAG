      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Which of the following beta adrenergic agonist is used as an aerosol for treatment of bronchial asthma?\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Salbutamol\nopb. Ketotifen\nopc. Fluticasone\nopd. Monteleukast\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Salbutamol\" -> \"beta adrenergic agonist\" -> \"bronchodilation\" -> \"aerosol form available\" -> \"treatment of bronchial asthma\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Ketotifen\" -> \"antihistamine\" -> \"not a beta adrenergic agonist\" -> \"not typically used as aerosol\" -> \"less likely for bronchial asthma treatment\" -> 20%\nCHAIN: \"Fluticasone\" -> \"corticosteroid\" -> \"anti-inflammatory\" -> \"aerosol form available\" -> \"not a beta adrenergic agonist\" -> \"used in asthma management\" -> 60%\nCHAIN: \"Monteleukast\" -> \"leukotriene receptor antagonist\" -> \"oral administration\" -> \"not a beta adrenergic agonist\" -> \"not used as aerosol\" -> \"less likely for bronchial asthma treatment\" -> 10%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Albuterol)-INTERACTS_WITH/ISA->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Adrenergic beta-Agonists)-Agonists)\n(fluticasone)-ISA->(Adrenal Cortex Hormones)\n(Histamine Antagonists)-ISA->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Adrenergic beta-Agonists)\n(Histamine Antagonists)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Stimulant)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Adrenergic beta-Agonists)\n(Ketotifen)-ISA->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Preservative free ingredient)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Histamine Antagonists)\n(Ketotifen)-ISA->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Sedatives)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Histamine Antagonists)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Salbutamol is a beta adrenergic agonist that causes bronchodilation and is available in aerosol form, making it suitable for the treatment of bronchial asthma. This aligns with the consensus that beta agonists like Salbutamol are commonly used in inhalers for asthma management. Ketotifen is an antihistamine, not a beta adrenergic agonist, and is not typically used in aerosol form for asthma. Fluticasone is a corticosteroid used in asthma management for its anti-inflammatory properties and is available in aerosol form, but it is not a beta adrenergic agonist. Montelukast is a leukotriene receptor antagonist, administered orally, and not used as an aerosol, nor is it a beta adrenergic agonist. Therefore, Salbutamol is the correct answer for a beta adrenergic agonist used as an aerosol for bronchial asthma treatment.\"\n}\n```",
