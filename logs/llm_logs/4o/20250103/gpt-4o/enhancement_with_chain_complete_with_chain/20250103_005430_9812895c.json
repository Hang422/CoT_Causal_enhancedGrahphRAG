      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Following is not true concerning amyloidosis (NOT RELATED)\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Amyloidosis associated with multiple myeloma has the poorest prognosis\nopb. Fine - needle biopsy of subcutaneous abdominal fat is a simple & reliable method for diagnosing secondary systemic amyloidosis\nopc. Hepatic amyloid disease produces hepatomegaly but rarely jaundice\nopd. Amyloidosis of the spleen is associated with severe anemia\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Multiple myeloma\" -> \"associated with AL amyloidosis\" -> \"poor prognosis\" -> 80%\nCHAIN: \"Subcutaneous abdominal fat biopsy\" -> \"simple method\" -> \"reliable for diagnosing secondary systemic amyloidosis\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Hepatic amyloid disease\" -> \"hepatomegaly\" -> \"rarely jaundice\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Amyloidosis of the spleen\" -> \"splenic involvement\" -> \"possible anemia\" -> \"severe anemia unclear\" -> 60%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Spleen)-LOCATION_OF->(Anemia)\n(Amyloidosis)-CAUSES->(Disease)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Respiration)-PROCESS_OF->(Spleen)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Option opa: Amyloidosis associated with multiple myeloma is typically linked to AL amyloidosis, which indeed has a poor prognosis, aligning with consensus. Option opb: Fine-needle biopsy of subcutaneous abdominal fat is a well-established, simple, and reliable method for diagnosing systemic amyloidosis, including secondary forms, which is consistent with medical consensus. Option opc: Hepatic amyloid disease often results in hepatomegaly and rarely causes jaundice, which is a widely accepted fact. Option opd: While amyloidosis of the spleen can lead to splenic involvement and possible anemia, the association with severe anemia is not strongly supported by consensus. The retrieved evidence paths do not directly support the claim of severe anemia in splenic amyloidosis, making option opd the least supported and potentially incorrect statement.\"\n}\n```",
