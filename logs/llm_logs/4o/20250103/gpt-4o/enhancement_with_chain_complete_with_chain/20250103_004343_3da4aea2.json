      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Ethambutol causes\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Retro bulbar neuritis\nopb. Deafness\nopc. Red urine\nopd. Peripheral neuritis\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Ethambutol\" -> \"optic nerve toxicity\" -> \"retro bulbar neuritis\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Ethambutol\" -> \"auditory system\" -> \"possible effect\" -> \"deafness\" -> 40%\nCHAIN: \"Ethambutol\" -> \"urinary system\" -> \"red urine\" -> 30%\nCHAIN: \"Ethambutol\" -> \"peripheral nerves\" -> \"possible effect\" -> \"peripheral neuritis\" -> 50%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Ethambutol)-TREATS->(Disease)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(physiological aspects)-PROCESS_OF->(Optic Nerve)\n(Ethambutol)-TREATS->(Disease)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Respiration)-PROCESS_OF->(Optic Nerve)\n(Ethambutol)-TREATS->(Disease)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Blood Circulation)-PROCESS_OF->(Optic Nerve)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Ethambutol is well-documented to cause optic nerve toxicity, leading to retro bulbar neuritis, which aligns with standard medical consensus. This is supported by evidence paths indicating Ethambutol's effects on the optic nerve. There is no strong consensus or evidence linking Ethambutol to deafness, red urine, or peripheral neuritis. Therefore, the most accurate and consensus-supported effect of Ethambutol is retro bulbar neuritis.\"\n}\n```",
