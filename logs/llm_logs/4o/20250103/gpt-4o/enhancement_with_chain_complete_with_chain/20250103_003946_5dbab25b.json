      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Drug used in triple drug therapy of H. Pylori:\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Metronidazole\nopb. Erythromycin\nopc. Ciprofloxacin\nopd. Aminoglycosides\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Metronidazole\" -> \"antibacterial action\" -> \"eradication of H. pylori\" -> \"component of triple therapy\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Erythromycin\" -> \"macrolide antibiotic\" -> \"less effective against H. pylori\" -> \"not standard in triple therapy\" -> 40%\nCHAIN: \"Ciprofloxacin\" -> \"fluoroquinolone antibiotic\" -> \"not typically used in first-line H. pylori therapy\" -> \"alternative in resistant cases\" -> 50%\nCHAIN: \"Aminoglycosides\" -> \"broad-spectrum antibiotic\" -> \"not effective against H. pylori\" -> \"not used in triple therapy\" -> 30%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Ciprofloxacin)-TREATS->(Staphylococcus aureus)-LOCATION_OF->(Microbicides)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Fluoroquinolones)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"In the treatment of H. pylori infection, standard triple therapy typically includes a proton pump inhibitor and two antibiotics. Metronidazole is commonly used as one of the antibiotics due to its effectiveness against H. pylori, aligning with the consensus that it is a component of triple therapy. Erythromycin, while a macrolide antibiotic, is less effective against H. pylori and is not standard in triple therapy. Ciprofloxacin, a fluoroquinolone, is not typically used in first-line therapy but may be considered in cases of resistance, though this is not standard practice. Aminoglycosides are broad-spectrum antibiotics but are not effective against H. pylori and are not used in triple therapy. The evidence path related to Ciprofloxacin's interaction with fluoroquinolones does not directly support its use in H. pylori therapy and is therefore not relevant to the question.\"\n}\n```",
