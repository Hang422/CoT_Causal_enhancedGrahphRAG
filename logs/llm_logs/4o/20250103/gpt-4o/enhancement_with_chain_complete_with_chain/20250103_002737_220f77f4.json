      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Which of the following drug is used in this test?\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Tolazoline\nopb. Clonidine\nopc. Bismuth\nopd. Oxymetazoline\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Tolazoline\" -> \"vasodilation\" -> \"increased blood flow\" -> \"diagnostic test for pulmonary hypertension\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Clonidine\" -> \"alpha-2 adrenergic agonist\" -> \"decreased sympathetic outflow\" -> \"reduced blood pressure\" -> \"diagnostic test for pheochromocytoma\" -> 80%\nCHAIN: \"Bismuth\" -> \"gastrointestinal protection\" -> \"treatment of ulcers\" -> \"not typically used in diagnostic tests\" -> 60%\nCHAIN: \"Oxymetazoline\" -> \"vasoconstriction\" -> \"reduced nasal congestion\" -> \"not typically used in diagnostic tests\" -> 60%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Tolazoline)-TREATS->(Hypertensive disease)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Vasodilation)\n(Tolazoline)-TREATS->(Gastrointestinal Hemorrhage)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Vasodilation)\n(Tolazoline)-TREATS->(Ischemia)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Vasodilation)\n(Ulcer)-PREDISPOSES->(Symptoms)-CAUSES->(Diagnostic tests)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Tolazoline is a vasodilator used in diagnostic tests for pulmonary hypertension due to its ability to increase blood flow, aligning with the consensus that it can be used to assess pulmonary vascular reactivity. The evidence paths support its role in vasodilation, which is relevant to its use in such tests. Clonidine, an alpha-2 adrenergic agonist, is used in diagnostic tests for pheochromocytoma due to its effect on reducing sympathetic outflow and blood pressure, which is consistent with standard medical practice. Bismuth is primarily used for gastrointestinal protection and ulcer treatment, not typically in diagnostic tests, which aligns with consensus. Oxymetazoline is a vasoconstrictor used for reducing nasal congestion and is not typically used in diagnostic tests, consistent with standard medical understanding. Therefore, Tolazoline is the drug used in the diagnostic test for pulmonary hypertension.\"\n}\n```",
