      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Biochemistry.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        In this child Which of the following enzymes is likely to be deficient?\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. HGPRTase\nopb. Adenosine deaminase\nopc. APRTase\nopd. Acid maltase\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"HGPRTase deficiency\" -> \"accumulation of uric acid\" -> \"gout-like symptoms\" -> \"neurological symptoms\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Adenosine deaminase deficiency\" -> \"accumulation of toxic metabolites\" -> \"immunodeficiency\" -> \"recurrent infections\" -> 80%\nCHAIN: \"APRTase deficiency\" -> \"accumulation of adenine\" -> \"formation of 2,8-dihydroxyadenine stones\" -> \"kidney stones\" -> 70%\nCHAIN: \"Acid maltase deficiency\" -> \"glycogen accumulation in lysosomes\" -> \"muscle weakness\" -> \"cardiomyopathy\" -> 75%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Paresis)-CAUSES->(Disease)-CAUSES->(Cardiomyopathies)\n(Lysosomes)-PART_OF->(Intestines)-LOCATION_OF->(Paresis)\n(Lysosomes)-PART_OF->(Bone Marrow)-LOCATION_OF->(Paresis)\n(Glycogen)-CAUSES->(Myocardial necrosis)-CAUSES->(Inflammation)-CAUSES->(Paresis)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"In evaluating the potential enzyme deficiencies in the child, we consider the following: HGPRTase deficiency is associated with the accumulation of uric acid, leading to gout-like symptoms and neurological issues, which aligns with known symptoms of Lesch-Nyhan syndrome. Adenosine deaminase deficiency results in the accumulation of toxic metabolites causing severe combined immunodeficiency, characterized by recurrent infections. APRTase deficiency leads to the accumulation of adenine and the formation of 2,8-dihydroxyadenine stones, resulting in kidney stones. Acid maltase deficiency, also known as Pompe disease, causes glycogen accumulation in lysosomes, leading to muscle weakness and cardiomyopathy. The retrieved evidence paths, while broad, support the link between glycogen accumulation and cardiomyopathy, relevant to acid maltase deficiency. Therefore, if the child presents with muscle weakness and cardiomyopathy, acid maltase deficiency is the most likely enzyme deficiency.\"\n}\n```",
