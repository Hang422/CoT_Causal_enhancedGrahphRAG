      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Which of the following can be blocked by atropine, a muscarinic receptor blocker?\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Increased blood pressure caused by nicotine\nopb. Increased skeletal muscle strength caused by neostigmine, an acetycholine esterase inhibitor\nopc. Bradycardia caused by infusion of acetylcholine\nopd. All of these\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Atropine\" -> \"blocks muscarinic receptors\" -> \"prevents acetylcholine action on heart\" -> \"prevents bradycardia\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Atropine\" -> \"blocks muscarinic receptors\" -> \"no effect on nicotinic receptors\" -> \"no effect on nicotine-induced blood pressure increase\" -> 70%\nCHAIN: \"Atropine\" -> \"blocks muscarinic receptors\" -> \"no effect on skeletal muscle\" -> \"no effect on neostigmine-induced muscle strength increase\" -> 70%\nCHAIN: \"Atropine\" -> \"blocks muscarinic receptors\" -> \"prevents acetylcholine action on heart\" -> \"prevents bradycardia\" -> \"no effect on nicotine or neostigmine actions\" -> 85%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Obstruction)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Biological Transport, Active)-PROCESS_OF->(Skeletal muscle structure)\n(Obstruction)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(voltage gated channel)-PROCESS_OF->(Skeletal muscle structure)\n(Obstruction)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Physiologic Function)-PROCESS_OF->(Skeletal muscle structure)\n(Atropine)-TREATS->(Pathological Dilatation)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Muscarinic Acetylcholine Receptor)\n(Atropine)-TREATS->(Hypersensitivity)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Muscarinic Acetylcholine Receptor)\n(Obstruction)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Nicotinic Receptors)\n(Obstruction)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Biological Transport, Active)-PROCESS_OF->(Heart)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Atropine is a muscarinic receptor blocker, which means it can prevent the effects of acetylcholine on muscarinic receptors, such as those in the heart. This aligns with the consensus that atropine can prevent bradycardia caused by acetylcholine infusion, as muscarinic receptors mediate this effect. Atropine does not affect nicotinic receptors, which are responsible for the effects of nicotine on blood pressure and neostigmine on skeletal muscle strength. Therefore, atropine cannot block the increased blood pressure caused by nicotine or the increased skeletal muscle strength caused by neostigmine. The retrieved evidence paths confirm that atropine's action is associated with muscarinic receptors and not with nicotinic receptors or skeletal muscle function. Thus, the correct option is that atropine can block bradycardia caused by acetylcholine infusion.\"\n}\n```",
