      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Mark the true statement regarding use of Lithium in maniac-depressive psychosis?\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Monotherapy for acute episodes\nopb. Monitoring of serum concentration is not useful for guiding dose adjustment\nopc. Can result in leucocytosis\nopd. Can result in hypehyroidism on long term use\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Lithium\" -> \"used in acute manic episodes\" -> \"monotherapy possible\" -> 70%\nCHAIN: \"Lithium\" -> \"serum concentration monitoring\" -> \"guides dose adjustment\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Lithium\" -> \"increases white blood cell count\" -> \"leucocytosis\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Lithium\" -> \"long-term use\" -> \"thyroid dysfunction\" -> \"hypothyroidism\" -> 85%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Lithium)-CAUSES->(Antiinflammatory Effect)-PROCESS_OF->(Bone Marrow)-LOCATION_OF->(White Blood Cell Count procedure)\n(Lithium)-CAUSES->(Antiinflammatory Effect)-PROCESS_OF->(Peritoneum)-LOCATION_OF->(White Blood Cell Count procedure)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Lithium is not typically used as monotherapy for acute manic episodes; it is often combined with other medications for better efficacy. Monitoring of serum concentration is crucial for guiding dose adjustment, as lithium has a narrow therapeutic index. Lithium can cause leucocytosis, which is an increase in white blood cell count, aligning with the evidence path indicating its effect on bone marrow. Long-term use of lithium is more commonly associated with hypothyroidism rather than hyperthyroidism, as it can lead to thyroid dysfunction. Therefore, the true statement is that lithium can result in leucocytosis.\"\n}\n```",
