      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Which of the following statements is FALSE regarding vincristine?\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. It is an alkaloid\nopb. Its use is associated with neurotoxicity\nopc. It does not cause alopecia\nopd. It is a useful drug for induction of remission in acute lymphoblastic leukemia\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Vincristine\" -> \"alkaloid\" -> \"plant-derived\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Vincristine\" -> \"neurotoxicity\" -> \"peripheral neuropathy\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Vincristine\" -> \"does not cause alopecia\" -> \"hair loss uncommon\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Vincristine\" -> \"acute lymphoblastic leukemia\" -> \"induction of remission\" -> 90%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Vincristine)-TREATS->(Symptoms)-CAUSES->(Alopecia)\n(Vincristine)-PREDISPOSES->(Infection)-CAUSES->(Alopecia)\n(Vincristine)-TREATS->(Disease)-CAUSES->(Alopecia)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Vincristine is a plant-derived alkaloid, which aligns with the consensus that it is an alkaloid used in chemotherapy. It is well-documented to cause neurotoxicity, particularly peripheral neuropathy, which is consistent with standard medical knowledge. While vincristine is associated with hair loss, it is less common compared to other chemotherapeutic agents, but not entirely absent, contradicting the statement that it does not cause alopecia. Vincristine is effectively used in the induction of remission in acute lymphoblastic leukemia, which is a well-established use. Therefore, the false statement is that vincristine does not cause alopecia, as it can cause hair loss, albeit less frequently.\"\n}\n```",
