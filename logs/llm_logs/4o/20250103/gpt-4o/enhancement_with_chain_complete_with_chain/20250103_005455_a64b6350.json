      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Therapeutic blood range of theophylline in microgram per L is:\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. 0-5\nopb. 10-May\nopc. 15-May\nopd. 20-May\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Theophylline\" -> \"bronchodilator\" -> \"used in asthma/COPD\" -> \"therapeutic range important\" -> \"10-20 microgram per L\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Theophylline\" -> \"narrow therapeutic index\" -> \"monitoring required\" -> \"10-20 microgram per L\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Theophylline\" -> \"risk of toxicity\" -> \"above 20 microgram per L\" -> \"therapeutic range below 20\" -> \"10-20 microgram per L\" -> 80%\nCHAIN: \"Theophylline\" -> \"effective bronchodilation\" -> \"achieved at 10-20 microgram per L\" -> \"below 10 may be ineffective\" -> 75%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Theophylline)-INTERACTS_WITH/ISA->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Bronchodilator Agents)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"The therapeutic blood range of theophylline is widely accepted to be 10-20 micrograms per liter. This range is crucial for its use as a bronchodilator in conditions like asthma and COPD, where effective bronchodilation is achieved within this range. Theophylline has a narrow therapeutic index, necessitating careful monitoring to avoid toxicity, which occurs above 20 micrograms per liter. The retrieved evidence path confirms theophylline's role as a bronchodilator, supporting its therapeutic use within the 10-20 microgram per liter range. Therefore, the correct therapeutic range is 10-20 micrograms per liter, aligning with standard medical consensus.\"\n}\n```",
