      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Physiology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Which of the following peptides are not produced by the renal system?\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Renin\nopb. Angiotensin I\nopc. Erythropoietin\nopd. 1,25DHCC\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Renin\" -> \"produced by juxtaglomerular cells in kidneys\" -> \"part of renal system\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Angiotensin I\" -> \"produced by conversion of angiotensinogen by renin\" -> \"occurs in bloodstream\" -> \"not directly produced by renal system\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Erythropoietin\" -> \"produced by interstitial fibroblasts in kidneys\" -> \"part of renal system\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"1,25DHCC\" -> \"active form of vitamin D\" -> \"converted in kidneys\" -> \"produced by renal system\" -> 90%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Renin)-CAUSES->(Excretory function)-PROCESS_OF->(Kidney)\n(Renin)-CAUSES->(Thirst)-PROCESS_OF->(Kidney)\n(Erythropoietin)-CAUSES->(Cytoprotection)-PROCESS_OF->(Kidney)\n(Erythropoietin)-CAUSES->(Immunity)-PROCESS_OF->(Kidney)\n(Erythropoietin)-CAUSES->(biological adaptation to stress)-PROCESS_OF->(Kidney)\n(Renin)-CAUSES->(Hypertensive disease)-CAUSES->(Disease)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Blood Circulation)\n(Renin)-CAUSES->(Hypertensive disease)-CAUSES->(Cardiovascular Diseases)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Blood Circulation)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Renin is produced by the juxtaglomerular cells in the kidneys, making it a product of the renal system. Angiotensin I is formed in the bloodstream through the conversion of angiotensinogen by renin, and while this process is initiated by a renal product, Angiotensin I itself is not directly produced by the renal system. Erythropoietin is produced by interstitial fibroblasts in the kidneys, confirming its origin within the renal system. 1,25-Dihydroxycholecalciferol (1,25DHCC), the active form of vitamin D, is synthesized in the kidneys, thus it is a product of the renal system. Therefore, Angiotensin I is the peptide not directly produced by the renal system. The evidence paths confirm the roles of renin and erythropoietin in kidney-related processes but do not directly address the production of Angiotensin I or 1,25DHCC, which aligns with the consensus that Angiotensin I is not a direct renal product.\"\n}\n```",
