      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Physiology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Actions of cholecystokinin include which one of the following?\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Contraction of gall bladder\nopb. Secretion of pancreatic juice rich in enzymes\nopc. Increases the secretion of enterokinase\nopd. All\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Cholecystokinin\" -> \"stimulates gall bladder\" -> \"contraction of gall bladder\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Cholecystokinin\" -> \"stimulates pancreas\" -> \"secretion of pancreatic juice\" -> \"rich in enzymes\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Cholecystokinin\" -> \"possible effect on enterokinase\" -> \"unclear increase in secretion\" -> 50%\nCHAIN: \"Cholecystokinin\" -> \"contraction of gall bladder\" -> \"secretion of pancreatic juice rich in enzymes\" -> \"no clear effect on enterokinase\" -> 85%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Cholecystokinin)-CAUSES->(fluid secretion)-PROCESS_OF->(Gallbladder)\n(Cholecystokinin)-CAUSES->(uptake)-PROCESS_OF->(Gallbladder)\n(Cholecystokinin)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Cells)-INTERACTS_WITH->(ENTEROPEPTIDASE)\n(Gallbladder)-LOCATION_OF->(Pathogenesis)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Enzymes)\n(Gallbladder)-LOCATION_OF->(Lipopolysaccharides)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Enzymes)\n(Contraction)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Genes)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Enzymes)\n(Contraction)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(APEX1 protein, human|APEX1)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Enzymes)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Cholecystokinin (CCK) is a hormone known to stimulate the contraction of the gallbladder, leading to the release of bile, and to stimulate the pancreas to secrete pancreatic juice rich in digestive enzymes. These actions are well-supported by physiological consensus. The evidence paths confirm CCK's role in gallbladder contraction and pancreatic enzyme secretion, aligning with the consensus. However, the effect of CCK on enterokinase secretion is not well-established or supported by strong evidence, making it less likely to be a primary action of CCK. Therefore, the most accurate actions of CCK are the contraction of the gallbladder and the secretion of enzyme-rich pancreatic juice, supporting options 'opa' and 'opb'. Option 'opd' is incorrect as it includes an unsupported action regarding enterokinase.\"\n}\n```",
