      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Which of the following anti-tubercular drug is avoided in a HIV positive patient on zidovudine, lamivudine and indinavir therapy who develops TB?\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Pyrazinamide\nopb. Isoniazid\nopc. Ethambutol\nopd. Rifampicin\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"HIV positive patient\" -> \"on zidovudine, lamivudine, indinavir\" -> \"develops TB\" -> \"consider anti-tubercular drugs\" -> \"Rifampicin\" -> \"induces cytochrome P450\" -> \"decreases indinavir levels\" -> \"reduced efficacy of HIV therapy\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"HIV positive patient\" -> \"on zidovudine, lamivudine, indinavir\" -> \"develops TB\" -> \"consider anti-tubercular drugs\" -> \"Rifampicin\" -> \"induces cytochrome P450\" -> \"decreases zidovudine levels\" -> \"reduced efficacy of HIV therapy\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"HIV positive patient\" -> \"on zidovudine, lamivudine, indinavir\" -> \"develops TB\" -> \"consider anti-tubercular drugs\" -> \"Rifampicin\" -> \"induces cytochrome P450\" -> \"drug interactions with protease inhibitors\" -> \"avoid Rifampicin\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"HIV positive patient\" -> \"on zidovudine, lamivudine, indinavir\" -> \"develops TB\" -> \"consider anti-tubercular drugs\" -> \"Pyrazinamide\" -> \"no significant interaction with HIV drugs\" -> \"safe to use\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"HIV positive patient\" -> \"on zidovudine, lamivudine, indinavir\" -> \"develops TB\" -> \"consider anti-tubercular drugs\" -> \"Isoniazid\" -> \"no significant interaction with HIV drugs\" -> \"safe to use\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"HIV positive patient\" -> \"on zidovudine, lamivudine, indinavir\" -> \"develops TB\" -> \"consider anti-tubercular drugs\" -> \"Ethambutol\" -> \"no significant interaction with HIV drugs\" -> \"safe to use\" -> 85%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Lamivudine)-TREATS->(Tuberculosis)\n(Zidovudine)-TREATS->(Tuberculosis)\n(HIV)-INTERACTS_WITH->(2019 novel coronavirus)-LOCATION_OF->(Lamivudine)\n(HIV)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Hepatitis B Virus)-LOCATION_OF->(Lamivudine)\n(Indinavir)-TREATS->(Tuberculosis)\n(Cytochrome P450)-INTERACTS_WITH/ISA->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Zidovudine)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"In HIV positive patients on zidovudine, lamivudine, and indinavir therapy, rifampicin is generally avoided when treating tuberculosis due to its strong induction of cytochrome P450 enzymes. This induction leads to decreased plasma levels of protease inhibitors like indinavir, significantly reducing the efficacy of the HIV treatment regimen. Additionally, rifampicin can lower zidovudine levels, further compromising HIV therapy. The other anti-tubercular drugs, pyrazinamide, isoniazid, and ethambutol, do not have significant interactions with the mentioned HIV medications and are considered safe to use in this context. Therefore, rifampicin should be avoided to prevent drug interactions that could undermine HIV treatment efficacy.\"\n}\n```",
