      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Physiology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Iron is absorbed in: March 2012\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Stomach\nopb. Duodenum\nopc. Ileum\nopd. Duodenum + Jejunum\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Iron\" -> \"absorbed primarily in duodenum\" -> \"major site of iron absorption\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Iron\" -> \"absorbed in duodenum\" -> \"some absorption in jejunum\" -> \"duodenum + jejunum\" -> 70%\nCHAIN: \"Iron\" -> \"minimal absorption in stomach\" -> \"not primary site\" -> 20%\nCHAIN: \"Iron\" -> \"absorbed in duodenum\" -> \"not primarily in ileum\" -> 10%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Iron)-CAUSES->(physiological aspects)-PROCESS_OF->(Duodenum)\n(Iron)-CAUSES->(Excretory function)-PROCESS_OF->(Duodenum)\n(Iron)-CAUSES->(biological adaptation to stress)-PROCESS_OF->(Duodenum)\n(Iron)-CAUSES->(Energy Metabolism)-PROCESS_OF->(Stomach)\n(Iron)-CAUSES->(physiological aspects)-PROCESS_OF->(Stomach)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Iron is primarily absorbed in the duodenum, which is the major site for iron absorption in the human body. This is supported by the consensus that the duodenum is the primary location for iron uptake due to its physiological role in nutrient absorption. While there is some absorption in the jejunum, it is not significant enough to consider it a primary site. The stomach is not a primary site for iron absorption, as its role is more related to the initial digestion and solubilization of iron. The ileum is also not a primary site for iron absorption. The retrieved evidence paths, while broad, support the physiological role of the duodenum in iron absorption, aligning with the consensus that the duodenum is the key site for this process.\"\n}\n```",
