      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        In which of the following patients would enalapril be the best first line agent for high blood pressure control ?\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. A 62 year old man with renal artery stenosis\nopb. A 32 year old pregnant female\nopc. A 41 year old woman with hyperkalemia\nopd. A 56 year old diabetic woman\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Enalapril\" -> \"ACE inhibitor\" -> \"reduces blood pressure\" -> \"protects kidney function\" -> \"beneficial in diabetes\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Enalapril\" -> \"ACE inhibitor\" -> \"reduces blood pressure\" -> \"contraindicated in renal artery stenosis\" -> \"risk of renal failure\" -> 10%\nCHAIN: \"Enalapril\" -> \"ACE inhibitor\" -> \"reduces blood pressure\" -> \"contraindicated in pregnancy\" -> \"risk of fetal harm\" -> 5%\nCHAIN: \"Enalapril\" -> \"ACE inhibitor\" -> \"reduces blood pressure\" -> \"risk of hyperkalemia\" -> \"not suitable for hyperkalemia\" -> 10%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Enalapril)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Losartan)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors)-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Enalapril, an ACE inhibitor, is effective in reducing blood pressure and is particularly beneficial for patients with diabetes due to its kidney-protective effects. However, it is contraindicated in patients with renal artery stenosis due to the risk of worsening renal function, in pregnant women due to the risk of fetal harm, and in patients with hyperkalemia as it can exacerbate high potassium levels. Therefore, the best candidate for enalapril as a first-line agent for high blood pressure control is a 56-year-old diabetic woman, as it offers both blood pressure control and renal protection in diabetes.\"\n}\n```",
