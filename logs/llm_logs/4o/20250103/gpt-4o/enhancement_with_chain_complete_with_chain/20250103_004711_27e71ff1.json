      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        A 50 years old man was recently diagnosed to be having coronary artery disease. There was no added risk factors except for a LDL value of 150-165mgs/dl. The single drug most appropriate for initial therapy is\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Gemfibrozil\nopb. Nicotinic acid\nopc. Bile acid binding resins\nopd. Statins (Any)\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Coronary artery disease\" -> \"elevated LDL cholesterol\" -> \"risk of atherosclerosis\" -> \"need to lower LDL\" -> \"Statins (Any)\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Coronary artery disease\" -> \"elevated LDL cholesterol\" -> \"consider lipid-lowering therapy\" -> \"Statins (Any)\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Coronary artery disease\" -> \"LDL 150-165 mg/dL\" -> \"primary target for therapy\" -> \"Statins (Any)\" -> 92%\nCHAIN: \"Coronary artery disease\" -> \"no other risk factors\" -> \"focus on LDL reduction\" -> \"Statins (Any)\" -> 93%\nCHAIN: \"Coronary artery disease\" -> \"LDL cholesterol management\" -> \"Statins (Any)\" -> \"most effective for LDL reduction\" -> 94%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors)-CoA Reductase Inhibitors)->(Complication)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Low-Density Lipoproteins)-Density Lipoproteins)\n(Low-Density Lipoproteins)-Density Lipoproteins)->(T-Lymphocyte)-Lymphocyte)->(Lipids)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors)-CoA Reductase Inhibitors)\n(Low-Density Lipoproteins)-Density Lipoproteins)->(T-Lymphocyte)-Lymphocyte)->(Lysophosphatidylcholines)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors)-CoA Reductase Inhibitors)\n(Lipid-lowering therapy)-TREATS->(Stenosis, unspecified)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(COG2)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"In the management of coronary artery disease with elevated LDL cholesterol levels, the primary goal is to reduce LDL cholesterol to lower the risk of atherosclerosis. Statins are the most effective class of drugs for lowering LDL cholesterol and are recommended as the first-line therapy in such cases. The reasoning chains consistently align with the consensus that statins are the most appropriate initial therapy for patients with elevated LDL levels, especially in the absence of other risk factors. The retrieved evidence paths, while broad, support the role of statins (Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors) in interacting with and reducing low-density lipoproteins, which is consistent with their mechanism of action. Therefore, statins are the most appropriate choice for initial therapy in this patient.\"\n}\n```",
