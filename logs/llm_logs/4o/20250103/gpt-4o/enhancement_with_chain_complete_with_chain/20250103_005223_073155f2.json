      "content": "You are a medical expert specializing in Pharmacology.\n        Your task:\n        - You have per-option reasoning chains (from previous step).\n        - You have retrieved evidence paths (enhanced graph info) that are correct but may be broad and not directly addressing the key point.\n        - Use standard medical/biochemical consensus to evaluate each chain.\n        - If a chain step contradicts consensus, correct or remove it.\n        - Check evidence paths: if they provide relevant support or clarify consensus, incorporate them.\n        - If paths are too broad or not relevant, do not let them mislead you.\n        - Aim to produce a final \"enhanced_information\" that:\n          1. Reflects corrected, consensus-aligned reasoning for each option,\n          2. Integrates helpful evidence from paths,\n          3. Excludes misleading or irrelevant info,\n          4. Focuses on what best helps answer the question correctly.\n\n        ### Question\n        Asprin is not given in a patient who is already on heparin because aspirin causes :\n\n        ### Options\n        opa. Platelet dysfunction\nopb. Aspirin inhibits the action of heparin\nopc. Enhanced hypersensitivity of heparin\nopd. Therapy of heparin cannot be monitored\n\n### Reasoning Chains per Option:\nCHAIN: \"Aspirin\" -> \"inhibits platelet aggregation\" -> \"platelet dysfunction\" -> \"increased bleeding risk with heparin\" -> 95%\nCHAIN: \"Aspirin\" -> \"inhibits cyclooxygenase\" -> \"reduced thromboxane A2\" -> \"platelet dysfunction\" -> \"increased bleeding risk with heparin\" -> 90%\nCHAIN: \"Aspirin\" -> \"platelet dysfunction\" -> \"increased bleeding tendency\" -> \"risk of bleeding with heparin\" -> 85%\nCHAIN: \"Aspirin\" -> \"no direct effect on heparin action\" -> \"heparin action unchanged\" -> \"unclear inhibition of heparin\" -> 20%\nCHAIN: \"Aspirin\" -> \"no known effect on heparin monitoring\" -> \"heparin therapy monitoring unaffected\" -> \"unclear impact on heparin monitoring\" -> 15%\n\n### Retrieved Evidence Paths (broad but correct):\n(platelet dysfunction)-MANIFESTATION_OF->(Hemorrhage)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Heparin)\n(Hemorrhage)-ASSOCIATED_WITH->(Heparin)\n(Aspirin)-CAUSES->(Thrombocytopenia)-PREDISPOSES->(platelet dysfunction)\n(Aspirin)-TREATS->(Virus Diseases)-CAUSES->(platelet dysfunction)\n(Aspirin)-TREATS->(COVID-19)-CAUSES->(platelet dysfunction)\n(Aspirin)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Pharmaceutical Preparations)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Heparin)\n(Aspirin)-INTERACTS_WITH->(Lymphocyte)-LOCATION_OF->(Heparin)\n\n        ### Instructions:\n        1. Recall standard consensus facts relevant to the question.\n        2. For each option's chain, compare steps to consensus and paths:\n           - Remove/adjust steps contradicting known facts.\n           - If paths confirm or clarify a point aligned with consensus, use them.\n           - Ignore irrelevant or overly broad paths that don't help.\n        3. If uncertain, note uncertainty but choose the best consensus-supported interpretation.\n        4. Output a short \"enhanced_information\" summarizing the corrected reasoning and relevant evidence that truly aids in final answer determination.\n\n        ### Output Format:\n        {\n          \"enhanced_information\": \"A concise, consensus-aligned summary integrating corrected reasoning and relevant evidence.\"\n        }\n        "

  "response": "```json\n{\n  \"enhanced_information\": \"Aspirin is not given to a patient who is already on heparin primarily because it causes platelet dysfunction, which increases the risk of bleeding. Aspirin inhibits cyclooxygenase, leading to reduced thromboxane A2 production, which is crucial for platelet aggregation. This results in platelet dysfunction and an increased bleeding tendency, especially when combined with heparin, an anticoagulant. The retrieved evidence supports this by linking platelet dysfunction and hemorrhage with heparin use. There is no evidence or consensus to suggest that aspirin directly inhibits heparin's action, enhances hypersensitivity to heparin, or affects the monitoring of heparin therapy. Therefore, the correct reason for avoiding aspirin in patients on heparin is due to the increased risk of bleeding from platelet dysfunction.\"\n}\n```",
