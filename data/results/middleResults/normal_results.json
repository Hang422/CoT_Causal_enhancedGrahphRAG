Therefore, a low insulin to glucagon ratio would favor processes that are stimulated by glucagon and inhibited by insulin."

Enamel lamellae are thin, leaf-like structures within the enamel that may act as pathways for caries spread, but they are not the primary facilitator. Striae of Retzius are incremental growth lines in enamel and do not directly contribute to the lateral spread of caries. The dentinoenamel junction, where the enamel and dentin meet, is a common site for caries initiation and progression due to its unique structure and composition, making it the most likely facilitator of lateral caries spread."

The middle cerebral artery (MCA) supplies blood to areas of the brain involved in motor function, including the primary motor cortex, and can lead to gait apraxia.
