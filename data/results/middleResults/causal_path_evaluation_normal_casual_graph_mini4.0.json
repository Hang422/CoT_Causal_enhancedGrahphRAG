    "analysis": "Venous blood flow in the lower limbs is typically characterized by a monophasic waveform in duplex Doppler studies, indicating a steady flow pattern that is less pulsatile compared to arterial flow. This is due to the lower pressure in the venous system and the effects of gravity and muscle contractions.",

    "analysis": "The calcific bridge formed after a calcium hydroxide pulpotomy primarily derives its calcium ions from the calcium hydroxide itself. Calcium hydroxide promotes the deposition of calcium ions, which leads to the formation of the calcific bridge in the tooth. While blood vessels and dentin may contribute to the overall calcium supply, the direct source in this context is the calcium hydroxide used during the procedure.",
