  "enhanced_information": "HGPRTase deficiency is associated with the accumulation of uric acid, leading to gout-like symptoms and neurological issues, which aligns with the symptoms described. Adenosine deaminase deficiency results in immunodeficiency and recurrent infections, which are not mentioned in the context. APRTase deficiency leads to the formation of kidney stones due to 2,8-dihydroxyadenine accumulation, which is not relevant here. Acid maltase deficiency causes glycogen accumulation in lysosomes, leading to muscle weakness and cardiomyopathy, supported by evidence paths linking glycogen to myocardial necrosis and inflammation. However, the symptoms described are more consistent with HGPRTase deficiency. Therefore, HGPRTase is the enzyme likely to be deficient in this child.",
  "analysis": "To determine the enzyme deficiency in this child, we need to consider the symptoms typically associated with each enzyme deficiency. HGPRTase deficiency is linked to Lesch-Nyhan syndrome, characterized by hyperuricemia, gout-like symptoms, and neurological issues such as self-mutilation and cognitive impairment. Adenosine deaminase deficiency leads to severe combined immunodeficiency, which would present with recurrent infections. APRTase deficiency results in kidney stones due to 2,8-dihydroxyadenine accumulation, which is not relevant to the symptoms described. Acid maltase deficiency, also known as Pompe disease, causes glycogen storage issues leading to muscle weakness and cardiomyopathy. Given the context provided, the symptoms align more closely with HGPRTase deficiency, as there is no mention of immunodeficiency, kidney stones, or muscle weakness. Therefore, HGPRTase is the most likely enzyme deficiency in this scenario.",
