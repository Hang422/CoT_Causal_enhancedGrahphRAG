  "enhanced_information": "The child's symptoms, including aggressive and self-mutilating behavior, poor concentration, joint pain, and reduced urinary output, are characteristic of Lesch-Nyhan syndrome. This condition is caused by a deficiency in the enzyme hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRT). The reasoning chains correctly identify HGPRT deficiency as the cause, aligning with the consensus that Lesch-Nyhan syndrome results from a disorder of purine metabolism leading to hyperuricemia and neurological symptoms. The retrieved evidence paths support this by linking neurological symptoms and purine metabolism disorders to arthralgia and Lesch-Nyhan syndrome, confirming the diagnosis. Therefore, the enzyme deficiency responsible for the child's presentation is HGPRT.",

This condition is caused by a deficiency in the enzyme hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRT). The symptoms align with the known effects of HGPRT deficiency, which leads to a disorder of purine metabolism, resulting in hyperuricemia and neurological symptoms. The enhanced information supports this diagnosis, confirming that the enzyme deficiency responsible for the child's presentation is HGPRT. Therefore, the most likely correct option is the one corresponding to HGPRT deficiency.",
