  "enhanced_information": "Opioids are known for several pharmacological actions. They effectively suppress cough (cough suppression), which is a recognized action of opioids. They can also induce nausea, but they are sometimes used in anti-emetic contexts, although this is not their primary use. Miosis, or pupil constriction, is a well-documented effect of opioids. Truncal rigidity, while a possible side effect of opioids, is not considered a primary pharmacological action. Therefore, the option that is NOT a pharmacological action of opioids is 'anti-emesis,' as it is not primarily associated with their therapeutic use, despite some overlap with nausea management.",
  "analysis": "Opioids are known for several pharmacological actions, including cough suppression (opa), miosis (opc), and truncal rigidity (opd). Cough suppression is a recognized therapeutic use of opioids, particularly in cases of severe cough. Miosis, or pupil constriction, is a classic sign of opioid use. Truncal rigidity can occur as a side effect, especially at higher doses or with certain opioids, but it is not a primary therapeutic action. The option 'anti-emesis' (opb) is less commonly associated with opioids; while opioids can induce nausea, they are not primarily used for anti-emetic purposes. Therefore, the best-supported option that is NOT a pharmacological action of opioids is 'anti-emesis.'",
