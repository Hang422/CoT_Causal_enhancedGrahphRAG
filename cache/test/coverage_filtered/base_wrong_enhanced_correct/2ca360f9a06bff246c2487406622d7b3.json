  "enhanced_information": "Metastatic calcification is most commonly associated with hypercalcemia and is frequently observed in renal tubules, particularly due to conditions like chronic kidney disease and hyperparathyroidism. The reasoning chains indicate that renal tubules are a primary site for metastatic calcification, supported by evidence showing a strong link between hypercalcemia and renal function (90% confidence). While the lungs are also a site of metastatic calcification due to their high vascularization (70% confidence), they are less commonly affected compared to renal tubules. The cornea and extensor tendon are less likely sites for metastatic calcification, with evidence suggesting they are affected much less frequently (75% confidence). Therefore, the most likely answer is 'opd. Renal tubules' as the primary site for metastatic calcification.",
  "analysis": "Metastatic calcification occurs due to elevated levels of calcium in the blood (hypercalcemia) and is most commonly seen in tissues that are highly vascularized or have a high turnover of calcium. Standard medical knowledge indicates that the renal tubules are a primary site for metastatic calcification, particularly in conditions such as chronic kidney disease and hyperparathyroidism. Enhanced information supports this by indicating a strong link between renal tubules and metastatic calcification, with a high confidence level. While the lungs can also be affected, they are less commonly involved compared to the renal tubules. The cornea and extensor tendon are not typical sites for metastatic calcification. Therefore, the most clinically valid answer is 'opd. Renal tubules'.",
