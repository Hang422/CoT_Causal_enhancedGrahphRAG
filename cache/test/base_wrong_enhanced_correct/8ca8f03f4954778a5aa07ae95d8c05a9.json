  "enhanced_information": "The statement that is false regarding Sickle Cell Disease is option 'opc': 'Sticky patch' is generated as a result of replacement of a non-polar residue with a polar residue. In fact, the mutation in Sickle Cell Disease involves a single nucleotide change that results in the substitution of Glutamic acid (a polar residue) with Valine (a non-polar residue), creating a 'sticky patch' that promotes hemoglobin aggregation. This aligns with the reasoning chain indicating that the replacement of a non-polar residue leads to abnormal hemoglobin aggregation. The other statements are true: the single nucleotide change does lead to the amino acid substitution, RFLP can indeed result from a single base change, and HbS does confer a selective advantage against malaria in heterozygotes. Therefore, the strongest reasoning chains support the conclusion that option 'opc' is incorrect.",
  "analysis": "Sickle cell disease is caused by a single nucleotide mutation in the HBB gene, which leads to the substitution of Glutamic acid (a polar amino acid) with Valine (a non-polar amino acid) in the beta-globin chain of hemoglobin. This mutation creates a 'sticky patch' that promotes the aggregation of hemoglobin molecules, leading to the characteristic sickling of red blood cells. The statement in option 'opc' incorrectly states that the sticky patch is generated by replacing a non-polar residue with a polar residue, which is the opposite of what actually occurs. The other options are accurate: the single nucleotide change does result in the amino acid substitution (option 'opa'), RFLP can result from a single base change (option 'opb'), and HbS does confer resistance against malaria in heterozygotes (option 'opd'). Therefore, the false statement is option 'opc'.",
