  "enhanced_information": "Based on the evaluation of the reasoning chains and supporting evidence, Bleomycin is the most likely drug associated with significant side effects, particularly pulmonary toxicity leading to pneumonitis. The reasoning chain for Bleomycin shows a strong alignment with retrieved path evidence indicating it causes pulmonary fibrosis and other respiratory complications, with a high confidence level of 85%. In contrast, while Busulfan is known for myelosuppression and Doxorubicin for cardiotoxicity, neither has the same level of specific adverse effects as Bleomycin. Actinomycin, while associated with mucositis, does not have as strong a direct link to severe side effects compared to Bleomycin. Therefore, Bleomycin is prioritized as the drug leading to the specified side effect.",
  "analysis": "The question asks which drug leads to significant side effects. Based on standard medical knowledge, Bleomycin is well-known for causing pulmonary toxicity, particularly pneumonitis and pulmonary fibrosis, which are serious adverse effects. This aligns with the enhanced information that emphasizes Bleomycin's association with respiratory complications. In contrast, Busulfan is primarily associated with myelosuppression, Doxorubicin with cardiotoxicity, and Actinomycin with mucositis, none of which have the same level of severe respiratory side effects as Bleomycin. Therefore, the reasoning strongly supports Bleomycin as the drug leading to the specified side effect.",
