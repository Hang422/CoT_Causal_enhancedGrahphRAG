  "enhanced_information": "Aldosterone primarily acts on the distal tubules and the collecting duct of the nephron. It promotes sodium reabsorption and potassium excretion, which are key functions in these segments. The evidence path indicating aldosterone's role in body fluid retention supports its action in these areas, as sodium reabsorption leads to water retention. The proximal tubule and loop of Henle are not primary sites of aldosterone action, as consensus indicates its effects are most significant in the distal tubules and collecting duct.",
  "analysis": "Aldosterone is a hormone that plays a crucial role in regulating sodium and potassium balance in the body. It primarily acts on the distal tubules and the collecting duct of the nephron. In these segments, aldosterone promotes sodium reabsorption and potassium excretion, which are essential for maintaining fluid balance and blood pressure. The proximal tubule and the loop of Henle are not the primary sites of aldosterone action. The enhanced information aligns with the standard medical consensus that aldosterone's effects are most significant in the distal tubules and collecting duct. Therefore, the most likely correct answer is that aldosterone acts on the distal tubules and the collecting duct.",
