  "enhanced_information": "Nonoxynol 9 is primarily known as a spermicide used in various contraceptive products, making it a barrier contraceptive. While it has been used in some formulations to prevent sexually transmitted infections (STIs), it is not effective for this purpose and can cause irritation with repeated use. Therefore, it is not recommended for frequent application. The most accurate conclusion is that Nonoxynol 9 is a barrier contraceptive.",
  "analysis": "Nonoxynol 9 is primarily recognized as a spermicide, which means it is used to kill sperm and is often included in barrier contraceptive methods such as condoms and spermicidal gels. While it has been marketed for use in preventing STIs, research has shown that it is not effective for this purpose and can actually cause irritation, which may increase the risk of STI transmission. Additionally, repeated use of Nonoxynol 9 in a single day is not recommended due to the potential for irritation and adverse effects. Therefore, the most accurate characterization of Nonoxynol 9 is that it is a barrier contraceptive.",
