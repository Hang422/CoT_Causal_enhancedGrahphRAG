  "enhanced_information": "Mineralocorticoid receptors are primarily found in the kidney, colon, and liver, where they play crucial roles in regulating electrolyte balance and blood pressure. However, they are not typically present in the hippocampus, which is primarily associated with glucocorticoid receptors. Therefore, the correct answer is that mineralocorticoid receptors are absent in the hippocampus.",
  "analysis": "Mineralocorticoid receptors (MR) are primarily found in the kidney, colon, and liver, where they are involved in the regulation of sodium and potassium balance, as well as blood pressure. The hippocampus, on the other hand, is known to predominantly express glucocorticoid receptors (GR) rather than mineralocorticoid receptors. Therefore, the correct answer is that mineralocorticoid receptors are absent in the hippocampus.",
