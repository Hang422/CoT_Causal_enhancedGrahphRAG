  "enhanced_information": "Levamisole is primarily an anthelmintic agent used to treat infections like ascariasis, typically administered in a single dose. It acts by causing paralysis of worms through a depolarization mechanism, which is effective against certain helminths. While Levamisole has immunostimulant properties and can enhance immune response, it is not primarily used as an immunodepressant; however, high doses can lead to immunosuppression, which is a conflicting use. Therefore, the option stating that Levamisole is used as an immunodepressant in high doses is incorrect, as this is not its primary indication.",
  "analysis": "Levamisole is primarily known for its use as an anthelmintic agent, particularly effective in treating ascariasis with a single dose. It works by causing paralysis of worms through depolarization, which aligns with its mechanism of action. Additionally, Levamisole has been used as an immunostimulant, enhancing the immune response in certain conditions. However, it is not typically used as an immunodepressant. While high doses of Levamisole can lead to immunosuppression as a side effect, this is not a therapeutic use or indication. Therefore, the option stating that Levamisole is used as an immunodepressant in high doses is incorrect, as it does not align with its primary medical applications.",
