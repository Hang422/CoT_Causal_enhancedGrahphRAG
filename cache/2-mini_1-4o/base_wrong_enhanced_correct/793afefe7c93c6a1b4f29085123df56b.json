  "enhanced_information": "Schizophrenia is primarily treated with anti-psychotic medications, which are effective in managing psychotic symptoms such as hallucinations and delusions. This aligns with the consensus that anti-psychotics are the first-line treatment for schizophrenia, improving overall functioning. While mood stabilizers may be beneficial for mood disturbances associated with schizophrenia, they are not considered first-line treatments and are less effective than anti-psychotics. Anti-depressants may be used for comorbid conditions but are not the primary treatment for schizophrenia, and their efficacy in this context is unclear. Anti-epileptics are not standard treatment for schizophrenia and have an uncertain role in management. Therefore, the most appropriate treatment option for schizophrenia is anti-psychotics.",
  "analysis": "Schizophrenia is a chronic mental disorder characterized by symptoms such as hallucinations, delusions, and cognitive impairments. The primary treatment for schizophrenia involves the use of anti-psychotic medications. These medications are effective in managing the core psychotic symptoms and are considered the first-line treatment. While other classes of medications like mood stabilizers, anti-depressants, and anti-epileptics may be used to address specific symptoms or comorbid conditions, they are not the primary treatment for schizophrenia. Anti-psychotics are the most supported and widely accepted treatment option based on medical consensus.",
