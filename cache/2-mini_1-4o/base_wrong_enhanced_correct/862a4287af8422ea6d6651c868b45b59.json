  "enhanced_information": "Schizophrenia is primarily treated with anti-psychotics, which are effective in managing the core psychotic symptoms of the disorder. While mood disturbances can occur in schizophrenia, mood stabilizers are not considered first-line treatments; anti-psychotics are preferred. Anti-depressants may be used for comorbid conditions but are not the primary treatment for schizophrenia. Anti-epileptics are also not standard treatment for schizophrenia, despite some cases involving seizures. Overall, the consensus strongly supports the use of anti-psychotics as the mainstay of treatment for schizophrenia.",
  "analysis": "Schizophrenia is a chronic mental disorder characterized by symptoms such as delusions, hallucinations, and disorganized thinking. The primary treatment for managing these core psychotic symptoms is the use of anti-psychotic medications. These drugs help to reduce the intensity and frequency of psychotic episodes and are considered the first-line treatment for schizophrenia. While other medications like anti-depressants and mood stabilizers may be used to address specific symptoms or comorbid conditions, they are not the primary treatment for schizophrenia itself. Anti-epileptics are not typically used in the treatment of schizophrenia. Therefore, based on standard medical knowledge and consensus, anti-psychotics are the most appropriate treatment for schizophrenia.",
