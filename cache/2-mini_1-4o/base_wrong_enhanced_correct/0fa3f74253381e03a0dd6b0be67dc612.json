Pyridoxine is crucial for nerve function, and its supplementation is recommended to prevent and treat INH-induced neuropathy. The reasoning chains consistently support that pyridoxine supplementation is effective in alleviating neuropathy symptoms associated with INH treatment. Evidence paths confirm that pyridoxine treats neuropathy and is associated with correcting vitamin B6 deficiency caused by isoniazid. Therefore, the best treatment for INH-induced neuropathy is pyridoxine.",
  "analysis": "Isoniazid (INH) is known to cause peripheral neuropathy due to its interference with vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) metabolism, leading to a deficiency. Pyridoxine is essential for nerve function, and its supplementation is recommended to prevent and treat INH-induced neuropathy. The enhanced information aligns with standard medical knowledge, confirming that pyridoxine supplementation is effective in alleviating neuropathy symptoms associated with INH treatment. Therefore, the most likely correct option for treating INH-induced neuropathy is pyridoxine.",
