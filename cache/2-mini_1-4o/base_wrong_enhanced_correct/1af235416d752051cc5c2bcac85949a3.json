  "enhanced_information": "Carbamazepine is approved for mood stabilization and is indicated for bipolar disorder. Sodium valproate is also effective in mood stabilization and is indicated for bipolar disorder. Lamotrigine is used for maintenance treatment in bipolar disorder, confirming its indication. In contrast, Vigabatrin is primarily used for epilepsy and is not indicated for bipolar disorder, as it is not commonly used for mood disorders and conflicts with bipolar treatment guidelines. Therefore, the drug not indicated for bipolar disorder is Vigabatrin.",
  "analysis": "In the treatment of bipolar disorder, several medications are commonly used for mood stabilization. Carbamazepine, sodium valproate, and lamotrigine are all well-established in the management of bipolar disorder. Carbamazepine and sodium valproate are used for their mood-stabilizing properties, while lamotrigine is particularly effective in the maintenance phase to prevent depressive episodes. Vigabatrin, on the other hand, is primarily used for epilepsy and is not indicated for bipolar disorder. It does not have mood-stabilizing properties and is not part of the standard treatment guidelines for bipolar disorder. Therefore, based on standard medical knowledge and treatment guidelines, Vigabatrin is the drug not indicated for bipolar disorder.",
