  "enhanced_information": "The 6-month-old male baby presents with vomiting, lethargy, and severe jaundice after the introduction of fruit juice, suggesting a metabolic disorder related to fructose metabolism. The symptoms are consistent with hereditary fructose intolerance, which is caused by a deficiency in Aldolase B. This enzyme is crucial for the metabolism of fructose, and its deficiency leads to the accumulation of fructose-1-phosphate, resulting in gastrointestinal symptoms such as vomiting and severe jaundice. Other options, such as Aldolase A and Fructokinase, are less likely to cause such severe symptoms upon fructose ingestion. The evidence supports that Aldolase B is the defective enzyme in this case.",
  "analysis": "The symptoms presented by the 6-month-old baby, including vomiting, lethargy, and severe jaundice upon the introduction of fruit juice, are indicative of a metabolic disorder related to fructose metabolism. The most likely condition is hereditary fructose intolerance (HFI), which is caused by a deficiency in the enzyme Aldolase B. This enzyme is responsible for the breakdown of fructose-1-phosphate in the liver, kidney, and small intestine. A deficiency in Aldolase B leads to the accumulation of fructose-1-phosphate, causing toxic effects and the symptoms observed. Other enzymes listed, such as Fructokinase, Aldolase A, and Sucrase, are not associated with the specific symptoms and timing related to fructose ingestion. Therefore, based on standard medical knowledge and the enhanced information provided, the defective enzyme is most likely Aldolase B.",
