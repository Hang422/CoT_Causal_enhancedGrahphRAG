Methylphenidate is FDA-approved for ADHD and is widely prescribed, confirming its status as the drug of choice.",
  "analysis": "Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is commonly treated with central nervous system stimulants, which are known to be effective in increasing attention span and reducing impulsivity. Methylphenidate is a well-established first-line treatment for ADHD, supported by clinical guidelines and FDA approval. The other options listed, such as Haloperidol, Imipramine, and Alprazolam, are not indicated for ADHD treatment. Haloperidol is an antipsychotic, Imipramine is a tricyclic antidepressant, and Alprazolam is a benzodiazepine, none of which are appropriate for managing ADHD. Therefore, based on standard medical knowledge and consensus, Methylphenidate is the drug of choice for ADHD.",
