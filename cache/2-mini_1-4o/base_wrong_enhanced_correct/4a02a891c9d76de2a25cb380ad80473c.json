  "enhanced_information": "Rosiglitazone activates PPAR-gamma, which primarily increases insulin sensitivity rather than directly stimulating insulin release, confirming it does not cause insulin release. Nateglinide, Glimipiride, and Tolbutamide all stimulate beta cells in the pancreas, leading to increased insulin secretion and thus causing insulin release. Therefore, the correct answer is Rosiglitazone, as it does not directly cause insulin release.",
  "analysis": "The question asks which of the listed drugs does not cause insulin release. Rosiglitazone is a thiazolidinedione that works by activating PPAR-gamma, which enhances insulin sensitivity in peripheral tissues but does not directly stimulate insulin release from the pancreas. In contrast, Nateglinide, Glimipiride, and Tolbutamide are all known to stimulate insulin release by acting on pancreatic beta cells. Nateglinide is a meglitinide, while Glimipiride and Tolbutamide are sulfonylureas, both classes known for their insulinotropic effects. Therefore, based on standard pharmacological knowledge, Rosiglitazone is the drug that does not cause insulin release.",
