  "enhanced_information": "Essential amino acids are those that cannot be synthesized by the body and must be obtained through diet. Leucine, Lysine, and Methionine are all classified as essential amino acids, meaning they are required for various physiological functions such as protein synthesis, growth, and metabolism. In contrast, Proline is classified as a non-essential amino acid because the body can synthesize it from other amino acids. Therefore, Proline is the exception among the options listed. This conclusion is supported by the consensus in biochemistry regarding the classification of amino acids.",
  "analysis": "The core medical principle here is the classification of amino acids into essential and non-essential categories. Essential amino acids cannot be synthesized by the human body and must be obtained through diet. Leucine, Lysine, and Methionine are well-established as essential amino acids. Proline, on the other hand, is classified as a non-essential amino acid because the body can synthesize it from other amino acids. This classification is widely accepted in biochemistry, and there is a strong consensus on this matter. Therefore, based on the standard medical knowledge and the enhanced information provided, Proline is the exception among the options listed.",
