  "enhanced_information": "Glycoproteins are biomolecules that consist of a protein core linked to carbohydrate moieties via glycosidic bonds. The core protein is essential for the structure and function of glycoproteins, and sugar residues can vary in length, with some being long. Therefore, the characteristics of glycoproteins include: 1) they contain a protein linked with glycosidic bonds, 2) they have a core protein, and 3) they possess sugar residues that can vary in length. The option 'None' is incorrect as glycoproteins have distinct characteristics that are well-defined in biochemistry.",
  "analysis": "Glycoproteins are characterized by the presence of a protein core linked to carbohydrate moieties through glycosidic bonds. This is a fundamental aspect of their structure. The core protein is crucial for their function, and the carbohydrate portion can vary in length, sometimes being long. Therefore, the most defining characteristic of glycoproteins is the linkage of protein with carbohydrates via glycosidic bonds. While the other options mention aspects related to glycoproteins, the most direct and defining characteristic is the glycosidic bond linkage. Thus, the best-supported option is that glycoproteins are proteins linked with glycosidic bonds.",
