  "enhanced_information": "The plasma membrane is anchored to the cytoskeleton primarily through the interaction of Spectrin and Ankyrin. Spectrin is a cytoskeletal protein that provides structural support and is directly associated with the plasma membrane. Ankyrin serves as an anchoring protein that connects Spectrin to the membrane, facilitating the linkage between the membrane and the cytoskeleton. Tubulin, while a component of the cytoskeleton, is not directly involved in anchoring the plasma membrane. Laminin is part of the extracellular matrix and does not play a role in this specific anchoring process. Therefore, the most relevant options are Spectrin and Ankyrin, with Ankyrin being crucial for the connection of Spectrin to the membrane.",
  "analysis": "The plasma membrane is anchored to the cytoskeleton through a network of proteins that include Spectrin and Ankyrin. Spectrin is a cytoskeletal protein that provides structural support and is associated with the plasma membrane. Ankyrin acts as an anchoring protein that connects Spectrin to the membrane, facilitating the linkage between the membrane and the cytoskeleton. While Tubulin is a component of the cytoskeleton, it is not directly involved in anchoring the plasma membrane. Laminin is part of the extracellular matrix and does not play a role in this specific anchoring process. Therefore, the most relevant options are Spectrin and Ankyrin, with Ankyrin being crucial for the connection of Spectrin to the membrane. Based on this understanding, Ankyrin is the most likely correct answer.",
