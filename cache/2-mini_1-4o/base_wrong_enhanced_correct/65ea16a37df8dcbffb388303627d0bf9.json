  "enhanced_information": "Nyctalopia, or night blindness, is primarily caused by a deficiency of Vitamin A. This vitamin is essential for the production of rhodopsin, a visual pigment necessary for low-light vision. The reasoning chains consistently highlight the link between Vitamin A deficiency and impaired retinal function, confirming that Vitamin A is crucial for the regeneration of visual pigments. Evidence paths support this by indicating that Vitamin A deficiency is associated with rhodopsin and retinal health. Therefore, the correct answer is Vitamin A.",
  "analysis": "Nyctalopia, commonly known as night blindness, is primarily caused by a deficiency in Vitamin A. This vitamin is crucial for the synthesis of rhodopsin, a photopigment found in the rod cells of the retina, which is essential for vision in low-light conditions. A deficiency in Vitamin A leads to impaired production of rhodopsin, resulting in difficulty seeing in dim light. The enhanced information aligns with standard medical knowledge, confirming that Vitamin A deficiency is the primary cause of nyctalopia. Other vitamins listed, such as Vitamin B, C, and E, do not have a direct role in the production of rhodopsin or in night vision, making them unlikely causes of nyctalopia.",
