  "enhanced_information": "The drug of choice for Treponema pallidum, the causative agent of syphilis, is Penicillin G, which is considered the first-line treatment due to its high efficacy. Tetracycline and Doxycycline are alternative treatments but are less effective than Penicillin G. Azithromycin is not a first-line treatment and is typically reserved for patients with penicillin allergies. Therefore, the consensus supports Penicillin G as the most effective and preferred treatment for Treponema pallidum infections.",
  "analysis": "The treatment of choice for infections caused by Treponema pallidum, the bacterium responsible for syphilis, is Penicillin G. This is based on its proven efficacy and long-standing use as the first-line treatment. While Tetracycline and Doxycycline can be used as alternatives, particularly in patients with penicillin allergies, they are not as effective as Penicillin G. Azithromycin is not typically used as a first-line treatment and is reserved for specific cases where other options are not viable. The consensus in medical guidelines strongly supports Penicillin G as the preferred treatment for syphilis.",
