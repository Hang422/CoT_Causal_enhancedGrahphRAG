  "enhanced_information": "Adrenal insufficiency is characterized by decreased production of cortisol and aldosterone. This leads to several physiological changes: 1) Hyponatremia occurs due to decreased aldosterone, which normally promotes sodium retention; thus, this option is associated with adrenal insufficiency. 2) Hyperkalemia results from decreased aldosterone, which leads to potassium retention; this option is also associated with adrenal insufficiency. 3) Hypoglycemia can occur due to decreased cortisol, which impairs gluconeogenesis; therefore, this option is associated as well. 4) Metabolic alkalosis is not typically associated with adrenal insufficiency; rather, adrenal insufficiency often leads to metabolic acidosis due to the loss of sodium and retention of potassium. Thus, the correct answer is metabolic alkalosis, as it is not associated with adrenal insufficiency.",
  "analysis": "Adrenal insufficiency is characterized by a deficiency in the production of hormones such as cortisol and aldosterone. This hormonal deficiency leads to several physiological changes. Hyponatremia occurs due to decreased aldosterone, which normally promotes sodium retention. Hyperkalemia results from decreased aldosterone, leading to potassium retention. Hypoglycemia can occur due to decreased cortisol, which impairs gluconeogenesis. Metabolic alkalosis, however, is not typically associated with adrenal insufficiency. Instead, adrenal insufficiency often leads to metabolic acidosis due to the loss of sodium and retention of potassium. Therefore, metabolic alkalosis is the condition not associated with adrenal insufficiency.",
