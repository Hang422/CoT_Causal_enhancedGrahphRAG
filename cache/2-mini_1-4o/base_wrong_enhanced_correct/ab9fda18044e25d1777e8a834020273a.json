  "enhanced_information": "Among the antihypertensive drug classes, ACE inhibitors are well-documented to cause a dry cough as a common side effect due to the accumulation of bradykinin. The reasoning chains consistently point to ACE inhibitors as the most likely cause of the cough, with confidence levels ranging from 75% to 90%. Other classes such as diuretics, calcium channel blockers, and beta blockers are not typically associated with this side effect. Therefore, the evidence strongly supports that the dry cough in this patient is most likely due to the use of ACE inhibitors.",
  "analysis": "The development of a dry cough in a patient taking antihypertensive medication is a well-documented side effect of ACE inhibitors. This occurs due to the accumulation of bradykinin, a peptide that can cause cough. Among the options provided, ACE inhibitors are the only class of antihypertensive drugs commonly associated with this side effect. Diuretics, calcium channel blockers, and beta blockers do not typically cause a dry cough. Therefore, based on standard medical knowledge and the enhanced information provided, the most likely cause of the dry cough in this patient is the use of an ACE inhibitor.",
