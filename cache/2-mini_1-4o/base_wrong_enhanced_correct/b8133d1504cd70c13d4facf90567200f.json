  "enhanced_information": "Cardiac muscle is characterized by striated fibers, which indicate the presence of sarcomeres, aligning with the consensus that cardiac muscle is striated. It also contains large T tubules that facilitate calcium entry, essential for excitation-contraction coupling. The troponin system is indeed present in cardiac muscle, playing a crucial role in muscle contraction. However, caldesmon is primarily associated with smooth muscle and is not a significant regulatory protein in cardiac muscle. Therefore, the statement that caldesmon is an important regulatory protein in cardiac muscle is incorrect, making it the exception among the options.",
  "analysis": "Cardiac muscle is known for its striated appearance due to the presence of sarcomeres, which aligns with option 'opa'. The presence of large T tubules in cardiac muscle is well-documented, supporting option 'opb'. The troponin system is a critical component of cardiac muscle contraction, confirming option 'opc'. Caldesmon, however, is primarily associated with smooth muscle and not cardiac muscle, making option 'opd' the exception. Therefore, the statement that caldesmon is an important regulatory protein in cardiac muscle is incorrect, as it does not align with the known characteristics of cardiac muscle.",
