  "enhanced_information": "Praziquantel is an antiparasitic medication primarily effective against trematodes, particularly schistosomiasis, which is caused by Schistosoma species. The reasoning chain for schistosomiasis is correct, as praziquantel is commonly used for this condition. In contrast, it is not effective against nematodes, which are responsible for strongyloidiasis, nor is it indicated for trichomoniasis, a protozoan infection, or rhinosporidiosis, which is caused by a fungus. Therefore, the only correct option for the use of praziquantel is for schistosomiasis.",
