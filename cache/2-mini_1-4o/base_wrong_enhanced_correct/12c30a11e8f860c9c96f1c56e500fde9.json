  "enhanced_information": "Glycogen storage diseases are a group of inherited metabolic disorders characterized by enzyme deficiencies that lead to abnormal glycogen metabolism. They include conditions such as Pompe disease and McArdle disease. Krabbe's disease is a lysosomal storage disorder caused by a deficiency in the enzyme galactocerebrosidase and is not classified as a glycogen storage disease. Similarly, Fabry's disease is a sphingolipidosis, which also does not involve glycogen metabolism. Fragile X syndrome is a genetic condition associated with intellectual disability and is unrelated to glycogen storage. Therefore, all three options (Krabbe's disease, Fabry's disease, and Fragile X syndrome) are not classified as glycogen storage diseases.",
  "analysis": "Glycogen storage diseases are characterized by enzyme deficiencies affecting glycogen metabolism. Krabbe's disease is a lysosomal storage disorder, Fabry's disease is a sphingolipidosis, and Fragile X syndrome is a genetic condition unrelated to glycogen metabolism. None of these conditions are classified as glycogen storage diseases. Therefore, the correct answer is that all the listed options are not glycogen storage diseases.",
