  "enhanced_information": "Dextromethorphan is an NMDA receptor antagonist, which can lead to dissociative effects and possible hallucinations, making it a significant candidate for causing such symptoms. Diphenhydramine, an anticholinergic agent, can also lead to CNS effects including confusion and hallucinations, though this is less common. Morphine, an opioid receptor agonist, primarily causes CNS depression and altered mental status, which can include hallucinations, but this is less frequent compared to the other two. Aprepitant, a substance P/neurokinin 1 receptor antagonist, is not commonly associated with hallucinations and is unlikely to cause such effects. Therefore, the most likely antitussives to lead to hallucinations are Dextromethorphan and Diphenhydramine.",
  "analysis": "Dextromethorphan is known to be an NMDA receptor antagonist, which can lead to dissociative effects and hallucinations, especially at higher doses. This is a well-documented side effect and aligns with the consensus in medical literature. While diphenhydramine can also cause hallucinations due to its anticholinergic properties, this is less common and typically occurs at higher doses or in sensitive individuals. Morphine, although it can cause altered mental status, is more associated with CNS depression rather than hallucinations. Aprepitant is not typically associated with hallucinations. Therefore, based on the pharmacological profile and common side effects, dextromethorphan is the most likely antitussive to cause hallucinations.",
