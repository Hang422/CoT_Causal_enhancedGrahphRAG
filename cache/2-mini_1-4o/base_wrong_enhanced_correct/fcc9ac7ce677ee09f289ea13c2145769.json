  "enhanced_information": "Cardiac muscle primarily utilizes fatty acids as its main energy source under normal conditions, as they are abundant in the bloodstream and undergo beta-oxidation to produce ATP. However, cardiac muscle is also capable of utilizing ketone bodies and glucose, especially during periods of fasting or increased demand. Ketone bodies are converted to acetyl-CoA, which enters the Krebs cycle, while glucose is metabolized through glycolysis to pyruvate, which is also converted to acetyl-CoA. All three substrates can effectively produce ATP, demonstrating the adaptability of cardiac muscle to different energy sources. Therefore, the correct answer is 'Any of the above' (option d), as cardiac muscle can utilize fatty acids, ketone bodies, and glucose for energy.",
  "analysis": "Under normal physiological conditions, cardiac muscle primarily relies on fatty acids as its main energy source. Fatty acids are abundant in the bloodstream and are efficiently oxidized to produce ATP through beta-oxidation. While cardiac muscle can also utilize glucose and ketone bodies, especially during fasting or increased energy demand, fatty acids remain the predominant energy source in a well-fed state. The enhanced information suggests that cardiac muscle is adaptable and can use any of the three substrates, but the consensus in medical biochemistry is that fatty acids are the primary source under normal conditions. Therefore, the most likely correct answer is fatty acids.",
