  "enhanced_information": "Erythromycin estolate is well-documented to cause cholestatic jaundice due to its mechanism of inhibiting bile flow, leading to increased bilirubin levels. INH (Isoniazid) is associated with hepatotoxicity and can cause jaundice, but it is not primarily cholestatic. Pyrazinamide can lead to liver dysfunction and jaundice, but it is not specifically known for causing cholestatic jaundice. Ethionamide can cause liver toxicity and jaundice, but it is also not commonly associated with cholestatic jaundice. Therefore, among the options, Erythromycin estolate is the most frequent cause of cholestatic jaundice.",
  "analysis": "Cholestatic jaundice is characterized by impaired bile flow, leading to the accumulation of bilirubin in the blood. Among the options provided, erythromycin estolate is well-documented to cause cholestatic jaundice due to its specific mechanism of inhibiting bile flow. While INH (Isoniazid), Pyrazinamide, and Ethionamide can cause liver toxicity and jaundice, they are not primarily associated with cholestatic jaundice. Therefore, based on standard medical knowledge and the enhanced information provided, erythromycin estolate is the most likely cause of cholestatic jaundice among the options.",
