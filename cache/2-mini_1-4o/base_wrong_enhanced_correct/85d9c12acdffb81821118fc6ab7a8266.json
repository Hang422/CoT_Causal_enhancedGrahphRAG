  "enhanced_information": "Epinephrine, when administered intravenously in high doses, primarily stimulates beta-adrenergic receptors, leading to increased heart rate and contractility, which can evoke extrasystoles in the heart. It also stimulates alpha-adrenergic receptors, resulting in increased liver glycogenolysis. Importantly, epinephrine stimulates beta-2 adrenergic receptors, causing bronchodilation, not bronchiolar constriction. Additionally, it activates the central nervous system, which can produce restlessness and anxiety. Therefore, the action that is not associated with high-dose epinephrine is 'causes bronchiolar constriction,' as it actually causes bronchodilation.",
  "analysis": "Epinephrine, when administered in high doses intravenously, primarily acts on both alpha and beta adrenergic receptors. It increases liver glycogenolysis through alpha-adrenergic stimulation, evokes extrasystoles in the heart due to beta-1 adrenergic stimulation, and can cause restlessness and anxiety by stimulating the central nervous system. Importantly, epinephrine stimulates beta-2 adrenergic receptors, which leads to bronchodilation, not bronchiolar constriction. Therefore, the action that is not associated with high-dose epinephrine is 'causes bronchiolar constriction,' as it actually causes bronchodilation.",
