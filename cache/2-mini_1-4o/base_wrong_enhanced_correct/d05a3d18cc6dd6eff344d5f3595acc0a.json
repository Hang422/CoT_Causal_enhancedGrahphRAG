  "enhanced_information": "Testosterone production is primarily attributed to Leydig cells, which are located in the interstitial space of the testes. Leydig cells synthesize testosterone in response to luteinizing hormone (LH) stimulation, making them the main contributors to testosterone production in males. Sertoli cells, found in the seminiferous tubules, support spermatogenesis but do not produce testosterone. The epididymis is involved in sperm maturation and does not produce hormones. Therefore, the correct answer is Leydig cells, as they are the primary source of testosterone in males.",
  "analysis": "Testosterone production in males is primarily attributed to Leydig cells, which are located in the interstitial space of the testes. These cells are responsible for synthesizing testosterone in response to luteinizing hormone (LH) stimulation. Sertoli cells, found within the seminiferous tubules, play a supportive role in spermatogenesis but do not produce testosterone. The seminiferous tubules themselves are the site of sperm production, not testosterone synthesis. The epididymis is involved in the maturation and storage of sperm but does not produce hormones. Therefore, based on standard medical knowledge and the enhanced information provided, Leydig cells are the main contributors to testosterone production.",
