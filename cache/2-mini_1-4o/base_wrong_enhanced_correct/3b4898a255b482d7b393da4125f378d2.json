  "enhanced_information": "Steroids are indicated in certain forms of tuberculosis to manage inflammation and prevent complications. In the case of meningitis, steroids are used to reduce inflammation and improve neurological outcomes. For pericarditis, they help decrease pericardial inflammation and lower the risk of cardiac complications. However, in ileo-caecal tuberculosis, steroids are not typically indicated due to the risk of exacerbating the infection and worsening the disease. In adrenal involvement, steroids are necessary to address adrenal insufficiency and restore hormonal balance. Therefore, the correct answer is ileo-caecal tuberculosis, as steroids are contraindicated in this condition.",
  "analysis": "Steroids are used in certain forms of tuberculosis to manage inflammation and prevent complications. In tuberculous meningitis, steroids are indicated to reduce inflammation and improve neurological outcomes. In tuberculous pericarditis, they help decrease pericardial inflammation and lower the risk of cardiac complications. In cases of adrenal involvement, steroids are necessary to address adrenal insufficiency due to the destruction of adrenal tissue by the infection. However, in ileo-caecal tuberculosis, the use of steroids is not typically indicated because they can exacerbate the infection and worsen the disease. Therefore, based on standard medical knowledge and consensus, steroids are not indicated in ileo-caecal tuberculosis.",
