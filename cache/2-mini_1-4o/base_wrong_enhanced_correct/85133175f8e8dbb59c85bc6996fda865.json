  "enhanced_information": "Hyperprolactinemia is primarily caused by dopamine antagonists, which increase prolactin secretion. Metoclopramide is a dopamine antagonist and is well-documented to cause hyperprolactinemia, aligning with the reasoning chain that states it increases prolactin secretion. In contrast, bromocriptine is a dopamine agonist that decreases prolactin levels, thus it does not cause hyperprolactinemia. Levodopa, a dopamine precursor, may decrease prolactin levels, and amantadine's effects on prolactin are unclear but generally do not lead to hyperprolactinemia. Therefore, the only option that directly causes hyperprolactinemia is metoclopramide.",
  "analysis": "Hyperprolactinemia is a condition characterized by elevated levels of prolactin in the blood. It is commonly caused by medications that act as dopamine antagonists, as dopamine normally inhibits prolactin secretion. Metoclopramide is a well-known dopamine antagonist and is documented to cause hyperprolactinemia by blocking dopamine receptors, leading to increased prolactin levels. In contrast, bromocriptine is a dopamine agonist and is used to treat hyperprolactinemia by decreasing prolactin levels. Levodopa, a precursor to dopamine, can also decrease prolactin levels. Amantadine's effects on prolactin are not well-documented, but it is not typically associated with causing hyperprolactinemia. Therefore, based on standard medical knowledge and the enhanced information provided, metoclopramide is the most likely medication to cause hyperprolactinemia.",
