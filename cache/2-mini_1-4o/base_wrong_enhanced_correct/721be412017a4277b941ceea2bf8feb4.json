  "enhanced_information": "Among the options, Tetracycline is the only drug with a known association with increased intracranial pressure, which can lead to Pseudotumour cerebri. The reasoning chain for Tetracycline is thus supported by consensus, indicating a risk of this condition. The other options (Sparfloxacin, Gentamicin, and Clofazimine) have no established links to Pseudotumour cerebri, and their reasoning chains correctly reflect this lack of association. Therefore, Tetracycline is the drug that causes Pseudotumour cerebri.",
  "analysis": "Pseudotumour cerebri, also known as idiopathic intracranial hypertension, is a condition characterized by increased intracranial pressure without an obvious cause. Certain medications are known to be associated with this condition, and Tetracycline is one of them. Tetracycline and its derivatives have been documented to cause increased intracranial pressure, leading to symptoms similar to those of a brain tumor, hence the term 'pseudotumor.' The other drugs listed—Sparfloxacin, Gentamicin, and Clofazimine—do not have a known association with Pseudotumour cerebri. Therefore, based on standard medical knowledge and consensus, Tetracycline is the most likely drug to cause Pseudotumour cerebri.",
