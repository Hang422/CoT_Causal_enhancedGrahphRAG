This is supported by the consensus that albumin is a major transport protein for non-esterified fatty acids. Other options, such as globulins and chylomicrons, do not play a significant role in the transport of free fatty acids for mitochondrial oxidation. Therefore, the correct answer is that free fatty acids are transported by albumin.",
  "analysis": "Free fatty acids are transported in the bloodstream primarily by binding to albumin. This is a well-established fact in biochemistry and physiology. Albumin acts as a carrier protein for non-esterified fatty acids, facilitating their transport to various tissues, including the mitochondria, where they undergo oxidation. While globulins and chylomicrons are involved in the transport of other types of lipids, they do not play a significant role in the transport of free fatty acids for mitochondrial oxidation. Therefore, based on standard medical knowledge and consensus, albumin is the correct answer.",
