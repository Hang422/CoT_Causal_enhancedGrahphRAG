  "enhanced_information": "Digoxin is known to interact with several drugs, leading to significant clinical implications. Cholestyramine binds to digoxin in the gastrointestinal tract, reducing its absorption and potentially decreasing its effectiveness. Thiazide diuretics can cause electrolyte imbalances, particularly hypokalemia, which increases the risk of digoxin toxicity. Quinidine, an antiarrhythmic, is known to increase digoxin levels, heightening the risk of toxicity. In contrast, Amlodipine, a calcium channel blocker, does not significantly affect digoxin levels, and minimal interaction is expected. Therefore, the drug that does not have significant interactions with digoxin is Amlodipine.",
  "analysis": "Digoxin is a cardiac glycoside with a narrow therapeutic index, and its interactions with other drugs can significantly impact its efficacy and safety. Cholestyramine can bind to digoxin in the gut, reducing its absorption. Thiazide diuretics can lead to hypokalemia, which increases the risk of digoxin toxicity. Quinidine is known to increase digoxin serum levels by reducing its clearance, thus increasing the risk of toxicity. Amlodipine, a calcium channel blocker, does not significantly interact with digoxin, as it does not affect digoxin's absorption, metabolism, or excretion. Therefore, based on standard medical knowledge and consensus, Amlodipine is the drug that does not have significant interactions with digoxin.",
