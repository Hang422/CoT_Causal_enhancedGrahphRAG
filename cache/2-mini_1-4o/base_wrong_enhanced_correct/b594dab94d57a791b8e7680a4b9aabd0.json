  "enhanced_information": "The drug of choice for bleeding oesophageal varices is octreotide. It is a vasoactive drug that reduces portal pressure and splanchnic blood flow, effectively controlling variceal bleeding. This aligns with the consensus that octreotide is recommended for acute management of variceal hemorrhage. Ethanolamine oleate is used for sclerotherapy but is not first-line for acute bleeding. Propranolol is a beta-blocker used for the prevention of variceal bleeding, not for acute management. Phytonadione (vitamin K) is used for coagulopathy but does not specifically address variceal bleeding. Evidence supports that octreotide treats acute hemorrhage associated with portal hypertension, confirming its role in managing bleeding oesophageal varices.",
  "analysis": "In the management of bleeding oesophageal varices, the primary goal is to control the hemorrhage and stabilize the patient. Octreotide, a somatostatin analogue, is widely recognized as the drug of choice for acute variceal bleeding due to its ability to reduce portal pressure and splanchnic blood flow, thereby controlling the bleeding. Ethanolamine oleate is used for sclerotherapy, which is a procedure rather than a pharmacological intervention for acute bleeding. Propranolol is used for the prevention of variceal bleeding in a chronic setting, not for acute episodes. Phytonadione (vitamin K) is used to correct coagulopathy but does not directly address variceal bleeding. Therefore, based on standard medical knowledge and consensus, octreotide is the most appropriate choice for acute management of bleeding oesophageal varices.",
