  "enhanced_information": "1. Amyloidosis associated with multiple myeloma is known to have a poor prognosis, which is widely accepted in medical literature. 2. Fine-needle biopsy of subcutaneous abdominal fat is indeed a simple and reliable method for diagnosing secondary systemic amyloidosis, supported by clinical practice. 3. Hepatic amyloid disease can cause hepatomegaly, but jaundice is indeed uncommon, aligning with consensus. 4. While amyloidosis of the spleen can lead to splenomegaly, it is not typically associated with severe anemia, which contradicts the known associations. Therefore, the statement regarding amyloidosis of the spleen being associated with severe anemia is the one that is not true.",
  "analysis": "Amyloidosis is a condition characterized by the deposition of amyloid proteins in various organs, leading to organ dysfunction. In the context of the options provided: 1. Amyloidosis associated with multiple myeloma is known to have a poor prognosis due to the aggressive nature of the underlying disease and the systemic involvement of amyloid deposits. 2. Fine-needle biopsy of subcutaneous abdominal fat is a well-established, minimally invasive method for diagnosing systemic amyloidosis, particularly secondary amyloidosis. 3. Hepatic involvement in amyloidosis often results in hepatomegaly, but jaundice is uncommon because the amyloid deposits do not typically obstruct bile flow. 4. While amyloidosis can affect the spleen, leading to splenomegaly, it is not commonly associated with severe anemia. Anemia in amyloidosis is more often related to renal involvement or bone marrow infiltration. Therefore, the statement that amyloidosis of the spleen is associated with severe anemia is not true based on standard medical knowledge.",
