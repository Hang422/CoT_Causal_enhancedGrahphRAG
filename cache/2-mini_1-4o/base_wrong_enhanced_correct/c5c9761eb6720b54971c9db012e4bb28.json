  "enhanced_information": "Salbutamol is a beta adrenergic agonist that is commonly used as an aerosol for the treatment of bronchial asthma due to its bronchodilatory effects. Ketotifen is an antihistamine and not a beta adrenergic agonist, thus it is not used for bronchial asthma. Fluticasone is a corticosteroid with anti-inflammatory properties but is not a beta adrenergic agonist and is not used as an aerosol for bronchial asthma. Montelukast is a leukotriene receptor antagonist and also not a beta adrenergic agonist, hence it is not used as an aerosol for bronchial asthma. Therefore, the correct answer is Salbutamol.",
  "analysis": "The question asks for a beta adrenergic agonist used as an aerosol for the treatment of bronchial asthma. Salbutamol is a well-known beta-2 adrenergic agonist that is commonly administered via inhalation (aerosol) to provide quick relief from bronchospasm in asthma patients. Ketotifen is an antihistamine, Fluticasone is a corticosteroid, and Montelukast is a leukotriene receptor antagonist; none of these are beta adrenergic agonists or used as aerosols for immediate bronchodilation in asthma. Therefore, based on standard medical knowledge and consensus, Salbutamol is the correct answer.",
