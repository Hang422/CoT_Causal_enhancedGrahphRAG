Insulin consists of two polypeptide chains linked by disulfide bonds, confirming option b as correct. Insulin facilitates the uptake of glucose into cells and actually shifts potassium into the cell, which means option c is incorrect. The half-life of subcutaneous insulin is approximately 60 minutes, supporting option d as correct. Therefore, the true statements regarding insulin are options b and d.",
  "analysis": "Insulin is a hormone produced by the beta cells of the pancreas, not the alpha cells, which produce glucagon. Therefore, option a is incorrect. Insulin is composed of two polypeptide chains, A and B, which are linked by disulfide bonds, making option b correct. Insulin promotes the uptake of glucose and potassium into cells, not the shift of potassium outside the cell, so option c is incorrect. The half-life of subcutaneous insulin is approximately 60 minutes, which supports option d as correct. Based on standard medical knowledge, the true statements regarding insulin are options b and d.",
