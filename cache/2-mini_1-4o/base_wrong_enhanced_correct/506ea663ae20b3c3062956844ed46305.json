Therefore, the most accurate statement is that the sibling should receive INH prophylaxis.",
  "analysis": "In the context of a 9-year-old boy with uncomplicated pulmonary tuberculosis on isoniazid, rifampin, and ethambutol, the primary concern is preventing the spread of tuberculosis to close contacts. Isoniazid (INH) prophylaxis is recommended for young children who are close contacts of someone with active tuberculosis, as they are at higher risk of developing the disease. Therefore, his 3-year-old sibling should receive INH prophylaxis to prevent potential infection. A baseline auditory function test is not necessary because ethambutol is more associated with optic neuritis rather than auditory issues. Polyarthralgia is not a common adverse effect of the medications the boy is taking. The mother does not need INH prophylaxis unless she is at risk of developing tuberculosis, which would typically be determined by a positive tuberculin skin test or other risk factors. Based on these considerations, the most accurate statement is that the sibling should receive INH prophylaxis.",
