  "enhanced_information": "Phenytoin is an anticonvulsant medication that exhibits nonlinear pharmacokinetics, specifically zero-order kinetics at therapeutic levels, which means that its metabolism is saturated at higher concentrations. This supports option 'opa' as true. However, phenytoin is a known hepatic enzyme inducer, contradicting option 'opb'. It is primarily metabolized in the liver, with only a small fraction excreted unchanged in urine, thus option 'opc' is false. Additionally, phenytoin is teratogenic and can cause fetal hydantoin syndrome, making option 'opd' incorrect. Therefore, the only true statement is that phenytoin follows zero-order kinetics.",
  "analysis": "Phenytoin is an anticonvulsant medication that is well-known for its nonlinear pharmacokinetics, specifically zero-order kinetics at therapeutic levels. This means that its metabolism becomes saturated at higher concentrations, and the rate of elimination is constant regardless of concentration. This supports option 'opa' as true. Phenytoin is also a hepatic enzyme inducer, which contradicts option 'opb'. It is primarily metabolized in the liver, with only a small fraction excreted unchanged in urine, making option 'opc' false. Furthermore, phenytoin is teratogenic and can cause fetal hydantoin syndrome, thus option 'opd' is incorrect. Therefore, the most accurate statement is that phenytoin follows zero-order kinetics.",
