  "enhanced_information": "Vitamin K is the only fat-soluble vitamin identified to function as a coenzyme, specifically in the carboxylation of certain proteins required for blood clotting. Vitamin A is primarily involved in vision and immune function but does not act as a coenzyme. Vitamin E serves mainly as an antioxidant and is not known to function as a coenzyme. Vitamin D regulates calcium and phosphate metabolism but also does not function as a coenzyme. Therefore, the correct answer is Vitamin K.",
  "analysis": "The question asks which fat-soluble vitamin functions as a coenzyme. Among the options, Vitamin K is well-documented to act as a coenzyme. It plays a crucial role in the carboxylation of glutamic acid residues on proteins required for blood clotting, such as prothrombin. This function is unique among the fat-soluble vitamins. Vitamin A is involved in vision and immune function, Vitamin E acts as an antioxidant, and Vitamin D is involved in calcium and phosphate metabolism, none of which involve coenzyme activity. Therefore, based on standard medical knowledge and consensus, Vitamin K is the correct answer.",
