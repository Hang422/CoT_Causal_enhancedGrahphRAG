  "enhanced_information": "Iron absorption primarily occurs in the duodenum, which is the first part of the small intestine. While the jejunum also plays a role in iron absorption, the majority of iron is absorbed in the duodenum. This is supported by the consensus that the duodenum is a key site for nutrient absorption, particularly for iron. Therefore, the most accurate answer is that iron is absorbed in the duodenum, with some contribution from the jejunum. The evidence paths confirm the importance of the duodenum in iron absorption, while the jejunum's role is secondary.",
  "analysis": "Iron absorption primarily occurs in the duodenum, which is the first part of the small intestine. This is a well-established fact in physiology, as the duodenum is the main site for the absorption of various nutrients, including iron. While the jejunum may have a secondary role, the majority of iron absorption takes place in the duodenum. Therefore, based on standard medical knowledge and consensus, the most accurate answer is that iron is absorbed in the duodenum.",
