  "enhanced_information": "The stomach secretes pepsinogens and hydrochloric acid (HCl), which are essential for protein digestion. Pepsinogens are converted to pepsin in the acidic environment created by HCl. In contrast, lipase is primarily secreted by the pancreas and is responsible for fat digestion, not by the stomach. Therefore, the correct answer is that lipase is not secreted by the stomach.",
  "analysis": "The stomach is known to secrete pepsinogens and hydrochloric acid (HCl), both of which play crucial roles in the digestion of proteins. Pepsinogens are inactive precursors that are converted into the active enzyme pepsin in the presence of HCl. While the stomach does produce a small amount of gastric lipase, the primary source of lipase for fat digestion is the pancreas. Therefore, considering the primary secretions of the stomach, lipase is not a major secretion compared to pepsinogens and HCl. Thus, the most accurate answer is that lipase is not secreted by the stomach in significant amounts.",
