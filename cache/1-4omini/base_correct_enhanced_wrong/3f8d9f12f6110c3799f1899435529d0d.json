  "enhanced_information": "The drug of choice for digoxin-induced ventricular tachyarrhythmias is Amiodarone. This conclusion is supported by strong reasoning chains indicating that Amiodarone is a broad-spectrum antiarrhythmic effective for various arrhythmias, including those induced by digoxin toxicity. It has additional benefits in patients with heart failure, which is often a context for digoxin use. While Lignocaine is also effective for ventricular arrhythmias, it is generally considered less favorable than Amiodarone in the context of digoxin toxicity. Phenytoin and Mexiletine are less commonly indicated for this specific scenario. Overall, the evidence strongly supports Amiodarone as the preferred choice due to its efficacy and additional therapeutic benefits.",
  "analysis": "The core medical issue is the management of digoxin-induced ventricular tachyarrhythmias. Standard medical knowledge indicates that Amiodarone is a broad-spectrum antiarrhythmic agent effective for various types of arrhythmias, including those caused by digoxin toxicity. It is particularly beneficial in patients with heart failure, a common context for digoxin use. While Lignocaine is also used for ventricular arrhythmias, it is generally considered less effective than Amiodarone in this specific scenario. Phenytoin and Mexiletine are not typically first-line treatments for digoxin-induced arrhythmias. Therefore, based on both standard medical knowledge and the enhanced information provided, Amiodarone is the drug of choice for this condition.",
