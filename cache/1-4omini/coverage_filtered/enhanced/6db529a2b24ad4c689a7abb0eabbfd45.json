  "enhanced_information": "The statement that is WRONG about amiodarone is 'It has positive ionotropic action' (option b). Amiodarone is primarily classified as a class III antiarrhythmic agent, which works mainly by prolonging the action potential and refractory period in myocardial tissue. It does not have a significant positive inotropic effect; in fact, it can have a negative inotropic effect in some patients, particularly those with pre-existing heart failure. The other statements are correct: amiodarone is indeed the longest-acting antiarrhythmic drug, contains iodine (which can lead to thyroid dysfunction), and is associated with pulmonary fibrosis, a serious adverse effect. Therefore, the strongest reasoning chain supports that option b is incorrect, while the other options are validated by established pharmacological knowledge.",
  "analysis": "Amiodarone is a class III antiarrhythmic drug known for its ability to prolong the action potential and refractory period in myocardial tissue. It is recognized as the longest-acting antiarrhythmic agent available. Importantly, it contains iodine, which can lead to thyroid dysfunction, and it is associated with serious adverse effects, including pulmonary fibrosis. However, it does not exhibit positive inotropic effects; in fact, it can have a negative inotropic effect, especially in patients with heart failure. Therefore, the statement 'It has positive ionotropic action' (option b) is incorrect, making it the wrong statement about amiodarone.",
