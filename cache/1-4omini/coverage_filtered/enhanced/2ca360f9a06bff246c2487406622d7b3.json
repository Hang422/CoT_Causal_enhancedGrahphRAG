  "enhanced_information": "Metastatic calcification is most commonly associated with hypercalcemia and is frequently observed in renal tubules. The strongest reasoning chains indicate that renal tubules are affected in approximately 85% of cases, particularly in conditions like hyperparathyroidism, which also supports the 80% prevalence noted. While metastatic calcification can occur in various tissues, including the lungs and soft tissues, the evidence suggests that renal tubules are the definitive site of involvement. The retrieved paths confirm that hypercalcemia, a key driver of metastatic calcification, directly impacts renal tubule structure and function. In contrast, the cornea and extensor tendon are less commonly affected, with lower prevalence rates (around 70% and 65%, respectively). Therefore, the renal tubules are the most likely site for metastatic calcification, supported by both reasoning chains and path evidence.",
  "analysis": "Metastatic calcification is primarily associated with hypercalcemia and is most commonly observed in renal tubules. Standard medical knowledge indicates that renal tubules are significantly affected in conditions leading to elevated calcium levels, such as hyperparathyroidism. Enhanced information corroborates this, stating that renal tubules are involved in approximately 85% of cases of metastatic calcification. While other tissues like the lungs can also be affected, the prevalence in renal tubules is notably higher. The cornea and extensor tendon are less commonly involved, with lower prevalence rates. Therefore, based on both standard medical knowledge and enhanced information, the renal tubules are the definitive site for metastatic calcification.",
