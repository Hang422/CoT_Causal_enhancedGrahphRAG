  "enhanced_information": "Montelukast is a leukotriene receptor antagonist that primarily blocks leukotriene receptors, leading to reduced bronchoconstriction and inflammation, which is supported by the reasoning chain indicating its role in preventing inflammation associated with leukotriene activity. The strongest reasoning chain confirms that montelukast does not inhibit the lipooxygenase pathway, which is critical as it clarifies its mechanism of action. Additionally, montelukast is not effective for acute asthma attacks, as it requires prior administration for efficacy, further supported by the reasoning chain indicating its preventive role rather than acute treatment. Therefore, the correct statement is that montelukast 'blocks LT receptor' (option c), while the other options are either incorrect or misleading. Overall, montelukast is effective in managing chronic asthma but not suitable for immediate relief during acute episodes.",
  "analysis": "Montelukast is a leukotriene receptor antagonist, which means its primary mechanism of action is to block leukotriene receptors (option c). This action leads to a reduction in bronchoconstriction and inflammation associated with asthma. The statement that it inhibits the lipooxygenase pathway (option a) is incorrect, as montelukast does not act on this pathway. While montelukast can decrease the frequency of asthma attacks, it is not more effective than glucocorticoids (option b) in terms of overall asthma control. Furthermore, montelukast is not effective for acute bronchial asthma (option d) as it is not intended for immediate relief; it is used for long-term management. Therefore, the only true statement is that montelukast blocks LT receptors (option c).",
