  "enhanced_information": "The drug of choice for prophylaxis of motion sickness is Promethazine. This conclusion is supported by strong reasoning chains indicating its antihistaminic properties, which effectively reduce vestibular stimulation effects, with a high confidence level of 90%. Additionally, Promethazine is well-documented in clinical practice as a first-line treatment for motion sickness. In contrast, Ondansetron, while effective for nausea and vomiting, is not primarily indicated for motion sickness, leading to a lower confidence level of 50%. Metoclopramide and Domperidone also show limited efficacy in this context, with confidence levels of 55% and 50%, respectively, as they are not typically used for motion sickness prophylaxis. Therefore, Promethazine stands out as the most clinically relevant option for preventing motion sickness.",
  "analysis": "The core medical issue is the prophylaxis of motion sickness. Standard medical knowledge indicates that antihistamines, particularly Promethazine, are effective in preventing motion sickness due to their ability to block H1 receptors and reduce vestibular stimulation. Enhanced information supports this by stating that Promethazine is well-documented as a first-line treatment for motion sickness, with a high confidence level of 90%. In contrast, Ondansetron is primarily used for nausea and vomiting related to chemotherapy and surgery, not specifically for motion sickness, which is supported by a lower confidence level of 50%. Metoclopramide and Domperidone are also not typically indicated for motion sickness prophylaxis, with confidence levels of 55% and 50%, respectively. Therefore, Promethazine is the most clinically relevant and effective option for preventing motion sickness.",
