  "enhanced_information": "Ivabradine is primarily indicated for chronic stable angina, as it effectively slows the heart rate, thereby reducing myocardial oxygen demand and improving exercise tolerance (90% confidence). This is strongly supported by path evidence indicating its role in treating stable angina. While there is some potential benefit in paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT) due to its heart rate-reducing effects (70% confidence), it is not a primary indication. Importantly, ivabradine is not indicated for cardiomyopathy or irritable bowel syndrome, as there is no direct therapeutic effect or relevant mechanism of action for these conditions (95% confidence). Therefore, the most likely indication for ivabradine is chronic stable angina, with PSVT as a less likely but possible consideration.",
  "analysis": "Ivabradine is primarily indicated for chronic stable angina, as it effectively reduces heart rate, thereby decreasing myocardial oxygen demand and improving exercise tolerance. This is well-supported by medical literature and clinical guidelines. While there is some evidence suggesting it may have a role in managing paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT), this is not its primary indication. Importantly, ivabradine is not indicated for cardiomyopathy or irritable bowel syndrome, as it does not have a relevant mechanism of action for these conditions. Therefore, the most appropriate indication for ivabradine is chronic stable angina, making option 'opa' the correct choice.",
