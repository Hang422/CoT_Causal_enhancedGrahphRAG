  "enhanced_information": "Opioid-induced seizures can occur at therapeutic doses, particularly in susceptible populations such as children. Evidence suggests that while seizures are more commonly associated with certain opioid agonists, they are not exclusive to them. Diazepam is used for seizure management but is not necessarily the first-line treatment for seizures induced by opioids. Therefore, the most accurate statement is that children are more susceptible to opioid-induced seizures, supported by the reasoning chain indicating increased sensitivity to drugs in this population.",
  "analysis": "Opioid-induced seizures can occur at therapeutic doses, particularly in susceptible populations such as children. This aligns with the enhanced information indicating that children are more susceptible to opioid-induced seizures. The statement that seizures occur only with g-opioid agonists is incorrect, as seizures can occur with various opioids, not just g-opioid agonists. While diazepam is used for seizure management, it is not necessarily the first-line treatment specifically for opioid-induced seizures, which further weakens that option. Therefore, the most accurate statement is that children are more susceptible to opioid-induced seizures, supported by both standard medical knowledge and enhanced information.",
