  "enhanced_information": "The statement that warrants stoppage of niacin immediately (option c) is the least accurate. While flushing and pruritus are common side effects of niacin due to prostaglandin release (high confidence, supported by path evidence), discontinuation is not universally required, especially for mild symptoms (medium confidence). The other statements are supported by strong reasoning: flushing is more likely with ethanol (option b), aspirin can alleviate flushing in most patients (option d), and prostaglandin release is a key mechanism for flushing and pruritus (option a). Therefore, the correct answer is option c, as it misrepresents the clinical approach to managing niacin-induced flushing.",
  "analysis": "The question revolves around the side effects of niacin, specifically flushing and pruritus. Option a states that flushing occurs due to the release of prostaglandins by niacin, which is true and well-supported by medical literature. Option b suggests that flushing is more likely to occur if niacin is taken with ethanol-containing beverages, which is also accurate as ethanol can exacerbate flushing. Option d claims that aspirin alleviates flushing in most patients, which is supported by evidence showing that aspirin can inhibit prostaglandin synthesis, thus reducing flushing. However, option c states that flushing warrants immediate stoppage of niacin, which is misleading. While severe reactions may require discontinuation, mild flushing does not typically necessitate stopping the medication. Therefore, option c is the least accurate statement regarding niacin-induced flushing and pruritus.",
