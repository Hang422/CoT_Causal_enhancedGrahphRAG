  "enhanced_information": "Beta-blockers are indicated for angina pectoris, migraine prophylaxis, and essential tremors, as they effectively reduce heart rate and myocardial oxygen demand, help prevent migraines, and alleviate tremors. However, they are not typically indicated for AV block, as they can worsen heart block and may necessitate alternative treatments such as a pacemaker. The strongest reasoning chain supports the conclusion that beta-blockers are contraindicated in AV block, making it the correct answer.",
  "analysis": "Beta-blockers are commonly used for various conditions, including essential tremors, angina pectoris, and migraine prophylaxis. They work by blocking beta-adrenergic receptors, which helps reduce heart rate and myocardial oxygen demand, making them effective in angina and also beneficial in preventing migraines and alleviating essential tremors. However, in the case of AV block, beta-blockers can exacerbate the condition by further slowing conduction through the AV node, which can lead to more severe heart block. Therefore, they are contraindicated in patients with AV block. This reasoning aligns with standard medical knowledge and is supported by the enhanced information provided, which clearly states that beta-blockers are not indicated for AV block. Thus, the correct answer is that beta-blockers are used in all of the following except AV block.",
