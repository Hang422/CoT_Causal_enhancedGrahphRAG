  "analysis": "Montelukast is a leukotriene receptor antagonist that specifically blocks leukotriene receptors, which helps in reducing inflammation and bronchoconstriction associated with asthma. It does not inhibit the lipooxygenase pathway directly, nor is it more effective than glucocorticoids in decreasing the frequency of asthma attacks. Additionally, it is not effective for acute bronchial asthma as it is not a rescue medication.",
