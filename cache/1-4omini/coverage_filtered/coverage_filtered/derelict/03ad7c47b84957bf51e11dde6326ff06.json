  "analysis": "Raloxifene is a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) that is often preferred in postmenopausal women with low bone mineral density, especially in those with a strong family history of breast cancer, as it does not have the same risk of breast cancer as estrogen therapy. A previous hysterectomy would make estrogen therapy less necessary, but the key factor here is the family history of breast cancer, which would lead to a preference for raloxifene over estrogen therapy. Recurrent vaginitis and troublesome hot flushes are not strong indicators for choosing raloxifene over estrogen therapy.",
