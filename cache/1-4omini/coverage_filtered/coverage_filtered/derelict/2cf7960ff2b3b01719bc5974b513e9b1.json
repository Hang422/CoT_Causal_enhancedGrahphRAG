  "analysis": "Vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) is indeed associated with hypervitaminosis when taken in excessive amounts, is beneficial for postmenopausal osteoporosis, and its active form is calcitriol. However, it is not ineffective in the treatment of vitamin D resistant rickets; rather, calcitriol is often used in such cases. Therefore, the statement regarding its ineffectiveness is false.",
