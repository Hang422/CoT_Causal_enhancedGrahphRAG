  "question": "A 52-year-old construction worker had an 8-month history of muscle weakness, easy bruising, backache, and headache. Physical examination revealed cutaneous hyperpigmentation, pronounced truncal obesity, purple striae with a \"buffalo hump,\" and blood pressure of 180/100 mm Hg. Laboratory analyses revealed elevated concentrations of circulating coisol with an absence of a circadian rhythm. With high-dose administration of a glucocoicoid agonist, plasma coisol levels reduced significantly. What is the most likely cause of these symptoms?",

  "analysis": "The symptoms presented, including muscle weakness, easy bruising, truncal obesity, purple striae, hypertension, and elevated cortisol levels with a lack of circadian rhythm, are indicative of Cushing's syndrome. The significant reduction in plasma cortisol levels following high-dose glucocorticoid administration suggests that the hypercortisolism is due to an adrenal source rather than ectopic ACTH production or primary hyperaldosteronism. The most likely cause of these symptoms is adrenocortical hypersecretion of pituitary origin, which is consistent with Cushing's disease.",
