  "analysis": "Cisplatin is known to cause nephrotoxicity, particularly renal tubular damage, due to its accumulation in renal tubular cells. This can lead to acute kidney injury and other renal complications. Streptozocin can also affect the kidneys but is more associated with pancreatic toxicity. Methysergide and Cyclophosphamide have different side effect profiles that do not primarily include renal tubular damage.",
