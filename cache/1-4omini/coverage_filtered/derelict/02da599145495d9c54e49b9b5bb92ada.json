  "analysis": "Opioid-induced seizures are generally associated with high doses or overdose rather than therapeutic doses. Children may have a different pharmacokinetic profile, but they are not necessarily more susceptible to seizures from opioids compared to adults. Seizures can occur with various opioids, not just g-opioid agonists. Diazepam is often used to manage seizures, but it is not specifically the drug of choice for opioid-induced seizures, as the management may vary based on the clinical scenario.",
