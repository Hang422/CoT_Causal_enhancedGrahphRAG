  "analysis": "Metastatic calcification occurs when there is an excess of calcium in the blood (hypercalcemia), leading to calcium deposits in various tissues. It is most commonly seen in the lungs and renal tubules due to their roles in calcium metabolism and excretion. However, among the options provided, the renal tubules are more frequently associated with metastatic calcification due to their direct involvement in calcium handling and the common occurrence of hypercalcemia in renal pathology.",
