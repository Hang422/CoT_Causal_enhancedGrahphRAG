  "enhanced_information": "5'-nucleotidase, Adenylyl cyclase, and Na+-K+-ATPase are all recognized as enzymatic markers of the plasma membrane, as they are integral to its function and are located within or associated with the membrane. In contrast, Galactosyl transferase is primarily located in the Golgi apparatus and is not considered a plasma membrane enzyme. Therefore, Galactosyl transferase is the correct answer as the exception among the options provided.",
  "analysis": "In evaluating the options provided, we recognize that 5'-nucleotidase, Adenylyl cyclase, and Na+-K+-ATPase are all well-established enzymatic markers of the plasma membrane, playing crucial roles in various cellular processes. 5'-nucleotidase is involved in nucleotide metabolism, Adenylyl cyclase is key in the production of cyclic AMP, and Na+-K+-ATPase is essential for maintaining the electrochemical gradient across the membrane. In contrast, Galactosyl transferase is primarily associated with the Golgi apparatus, where it plays a role in glycoprotein and glycolipid synthesis, rather than being a marker of the plasma membrane itself. Therefore, Galactosyl transferase is the only enzyme listed that does not serve as a plasma membrane marker, making it the correct answer to the question.",
