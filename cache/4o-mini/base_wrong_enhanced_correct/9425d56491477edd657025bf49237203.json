  "enhanced_information": "Renin is produced by juxtaglomerular cells in the kidneys and is involved in blood pressure regulation, confirming its renal origin. Angiotensin I is not produced by the renal system; it is formed from angiotensinogen, which is produced in the liver, and is converted to angiotensin II primarily in the lungs. Erythropoietin is produced by interstitial fibroblasts in the kidneys and stimulates red blood cell production, confirming its renal origin. 1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25DHCC) is the active form of vitamin D, produced in the kidneys from calcidiol. Therefore, the peptide not produced by the renal system is Angiotensin I.",
  "analysis": "To determine which peptide is not produced by the renal system, we analyze each option: Renin is produced by juxtaglomerular cells in the kidneys, confirming its renal origin. Erythropoietin is also produced by the kidneys, specifically by interstitial fibroblasts, and plays a crucial role in red blood cell production. 1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25DHCC) is the active form of vitamin D, which is synthesized in the kidneys from calcidiol. In contrast, Angiotensin I is not produced by the kidneys; it is formed from angiotensinogen, which is synthesized in the liver. Therefore, the peptide that is not produced by the renal system is Angiotensin I. This conclusion aligns with established medical knowledge regarding the origins of these peptides.",
