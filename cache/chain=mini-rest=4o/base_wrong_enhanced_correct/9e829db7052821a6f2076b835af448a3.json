  "enhanced_information": "In severe renal failure, the choice of antitubercular drugs must consider renal excretion and potential toxicity. Streptomycin is primarily excreted by the kidneys, leading to accumulation and increased risk of toxicity in renal failure, making it unsafe. Ethambutol is partially renally excreted, requiring dose adjustment, and can be used with caution. Capreomycin is also excreted by the kidneys and poses a risk of nephrotoxicity, thus not recommended. Rifampicin is primarily metabolized by the liver with minimal renal excretion, making it generally safe for use in severe renal failure. Therefore, Rifampicin is the safest option among the listed drugs for patients with severe renal failure.",
  "analysis": "In the context of severe renal failure, the primary concern with antitubercular drugs is their excretion pathway and potential for nephrotoxicity. Streptomycin and Capreomycin are primarily excreted by the kidneys and can accumulate, leading to toxicity, making them unsafe in severe renal failure. Ethambutol is also renally excreted and requires dose adjustment, but it can still pose a risk if not carefully managed. Rifampicin, on the other hand, is primarily metabolized by the liver and has minimal renal excretion, making it the safest option among the listed drugs for patients with severe renal failure. This aligns with standard medical knowledge and consensus, indicating that Rifampicin is the most appropriate choice in this scenario.",
