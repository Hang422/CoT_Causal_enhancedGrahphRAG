  "enhanced_information": "Option opa: Amyloidosis associated with multiple myeloma is known to have a poor prognosis, aligning with medical consensus. Option opb: Fine-needle biopsy of subcutaneous abdominal fat is indeed a simple and reliable method for diagnosing secondary systemic amyloidosis, consistent with standard practice. Option opc: Hepatic amyloid disease typically causes hepatomegaly, and jaundice is rare, which is supported by medical literature. Option opd: While amyloidosis of the spleen can cause splenomegaly, it is not typically associated with severe anemia. The retrieved evidence paths suggest splenomegaly can be linked to anemia, but this is not a direct or common association in the context of amyloidosis, making option opd the least accurate statement regarding amyloidosis.",
  "analysis": "In evaluating the statements regarding amyloidosis, we consider the typical clinical presentations and diagnostic methods associated with the condition. Option opa is consistent with the understanding that amyloidosis associated with multiple myeloma has a poor prognosis. Option opb accurately describes the use of fine-needle biopsy of subcutaneous abdominal fat as a reliable diagnostic method for secondary systemic amyloidosis. Option opc correctly notes that hepatic amyloid disease causes hepatomegaly and rarely jaundice. Option opd, however, is less accurate because while amyloidosis of the spleen can cause splenomegaly, it is not commonly associated with severe anemia. Anemia in amyloidosis is more often related to renal involvement or other systemic effects rather than splenic amyloidosis specifically. Therefore, option opd is the statement that is not true concerning amyloidosis.",
