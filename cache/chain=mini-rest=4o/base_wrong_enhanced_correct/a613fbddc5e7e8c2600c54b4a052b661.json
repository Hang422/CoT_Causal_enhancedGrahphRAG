  "enhanced_information": "Enzymatic markers of the plasma membrane typically include enzymes such as 5'-nucleotidase, adenylyl cyclase, and Na+-K+-ATPase, all of which are associated with the plasma membrane. 5'-nucleotidase is known for its role in nucleotide metabolism at the cell surface, adenylyl cyclase is involved in the conversion of ATP to cyclic AMP and is a key component of signal transduction pathways at the plasma membrane, and Na+-K+-ATPase is crucial for maintaining the electrochemical gradient across the plasma membrane. In contrast, galactosyl transferase is primarily located in the Golgi apparatus, where it functions in glycosylation processes, making it an exception to the list of plasma membrane enzymatic markers. The retrieved evidence paths support the association of adenylyl cyclase with the cell membrane, reinforcing its role as a plasma membrane enzyme. Therefore, the correct answer is that galactosyl transferase is not an enzymatic marker of the plasma membrane.",
  "analysis": "The question asks for an exception among enzymatic markers of the plasma membrane. Enzymatic markers typically associated with the plasma membrane include 5'-nucleotidase, adenylyl cyclase, and Na+-K+-ATPase. These enzymes are involved in processes such as nucleotide metabolism, signal transduction, and maintaining electrochemical gradients, respectively, all of which are functions associated with the plasma membrane. On the other hand, galactosyl transferase is primarily located in the Golgi apparatus, where it plays a role in glycosylation. This makes galactosyl transferase the exception in the list provided, as it is not a marker of the plasma membrane. Therefore, the most likely correct answer is that galactosyl transferase is not an enzymatic marker of the plasma membrane.",
