  "enhanced_information": "The plasma membrane is anchored to the cytoskeleton primarily through the interaction of spectrin and ankyrin. Spectrin is a cytoskeletal protein that provides structural support by forming a meshwork beneath the plasma membrane. Ankyrin acts as an anchoring protein that connects spectrin to the membrane, facilitating the linkage between the plasma membrane and the cytoskeleton. Tubulin, while a component of microtubules, does not directly anchor the plasma membrane to the cytoskeleton. Laminin is part of the extracellular matrix and does not play a role in binding the plasma membrane to the cytoskeleton. The evidence paths support the interaction between ankyrin and spectrin, confirming their roles in membrane-cytoskeleton linkage.",
  "analysis": "The plasma membrane is connected to the cytoskeleton through a network of proteins that provide structural support and stability. Spectrin is a cytoskeletal protein that forms a meshwork beneath the plasma membrane, providing structural integrity. Ankyrin is an anchoring protein that connects spectrin to the plasma membrane, facilitating the linkage between the membrane and the cytoskeleton. Tubulin is a component of microtubules and does not directly anchor the plasma membrane to the cytoskeleton. Laminin is part of the extracellular matrix and is not involved in the direct binding of the plasma membrane to the cytoskeleton. Based on standard medical knowledge and the enhanced information provided, ankyrin is the protein that directly anchors the plasma membrane to the cytoskeleton by linking spectrin to the membrane.",
