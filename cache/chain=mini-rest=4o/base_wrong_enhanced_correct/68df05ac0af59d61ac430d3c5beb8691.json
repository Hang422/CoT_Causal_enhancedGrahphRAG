  "enhanced_information": "Aminoglycosides are known to be ototoxic, primarily affecting the cochlea's hair cells. The consensus in medical literature is that aminoglycosides predominantly damage the outer hair cells, particularly in the basal area of the cochlea. This is due to their mechanism of disrupting protein synthesis, leading to cell death, with outer hair cells being more vulnerable. The retrieved evidence paths support this by indicating interactions between aminoglycosides and genes associated with outer hair cells. Therefore, the most affected area by aminoglycosides is the outer hair cells in the basal area.",
  "analysis": "Aminoglycosides are a class of antibiotics known for their ototoxic effects, which primarily target the cochlea's hair cells. The consensus in medical literature indicates that aminoglycosides predominantly affect the outer hair cells in the basal area of the cochlea. This is due to their mechanism of action, which involves disrupting protein synthesis, leading to cell death. The basal area of the cochlea is responsible for high-frequency sound detection, and the outer hair cells in this region are particularly susceptible to damage from aminoglycosides. The enhanced information supports this consensus, indicating that the outer hair cells in the basal area are the most affected. Therefore, the most likely correct answer is that aminoglycosides affect the outer hair cells in the basal area.",
