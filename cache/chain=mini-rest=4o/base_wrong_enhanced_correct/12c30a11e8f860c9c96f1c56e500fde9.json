  "enhanced_information": "Glycogen storage diseases are characterized by abnormal glycogen metabolism and enzyme deficiencies affecting glycogen synthesis or breakdown. Krabbe's disease is a lysosomal storage disorder, not a glycogen storage disease. Fabry's disease is a sphingolipidosis, unrelated to glycogen metabolism, and thus not a glycogen storage disease. Fragile X syndrome is a genetic condition affecting the FMR1 gene, not related to glycogen storage. Therefore, none of the options (Krabbe's disease, Fabry's disease, Fragile X syndrome) are classified as glycogen storage diseases. The evidence paths provided do not directly support any of these conditions being glycogen storage diseases, confirming the consensus that all options are not glycogen storage diseases.",
  "analysis": "Glycogen storage diseases are a group of inherited metabolic disorders that involve the enzymes responsible for glycogen synthesis or breakdown. Krabbe's disease is a lysosomal storage disorder, Fabry's disease is a sphingolipidosis, and Fragile X syndrome is a genetic condition affecting the FMR1 gene. None of these conditions are related to glycogen metabolism. Therefore, none of the options listed are classified as glycogen storage diseases. The enhanced information supports this conclusion, confirming that all options are not glycogen storage diseases.",
