While Busulfan can cause myelosuppression and has a risk of pulmonary toxicity, it is not as strongly linked to lung damage as Bleomycin. Doxorubicin is primarily known for its cardiotoxicity, and Actinomycin is associated with myelosuppression and mucositis. Therefore, the drug that leads to the above-mentioned side effect of pulmonary toxicity is Bleomycin.",
  "analysis": "Bleomycin is well-documented in medical literature as a chemotherapeutic agent that can cause pulmonary toxicity, particularly pulmonary fibrosis. This side effect is significant and occurs in a notable percentage of patients treated with Bleomycin. While Busulfan can also lead to pulmonary toxicity, it is not as commonly associated with this side effect as Bleomycin. Doxorubicin is primarily known for its cardiotoxic effects, and Actinomycin is associated with myelosuppression and mucositis. Therefore, based on established medical knowledge, the drug that leads to the side effect of pulmonary toxicity is Bleomycin.",
