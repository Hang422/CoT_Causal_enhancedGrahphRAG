  "enhanced_information": "Zafirlukast is a leukotriene receptor antagonist that primarily blocks leukotriene receptors, thereby reducing bronchoconstriction and inflammation associated with asthma. It is administered orally in tablet form. However, it does not inhibit the lipoxygenase pathway directly. Therefore, the correct statements about zafirlukast are that it blocks leukotriene receptors and can be administered orally, but the claim regarding its inhibition of the lipoxygenase pathway is uncertain. Thus, the most accurate conclusion is that options 'opb' and 'opc' are true, but 'opd' (all of these) is not correct.",
  "analysis": "Zafirlukast is a leukotriene receptor antagonist, which means it primarily works by blocking leukotriene receptors (option opb). It is indeed administered orally (option opc). However, it does not inhibit the lipoxygenase pathway (option opa), as its mechanism of action is not related to that pathway. Therefore, while options opb and opc are true, option opa is false, making option opd (all of these) incorrect. Thus, the correct statements are that it blocks LT receptors and can be administered orally, but not all of the options are true.",
