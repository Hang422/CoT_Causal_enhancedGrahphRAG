  "enhanced_information": "Nonoxynol-9 is primarily known as a spermicide used in various contraceptive methods. It is not classified as a barrier contraceptive, which typically refers to physical devices like condoms. While it can be used repeatedly in a day, its effectiveness in preventing sexually transmitted infections (STIs) is limited, and it is not recommended for this purpose. Additionally, although it has detergent-like properties, it is not primarily used as a chemical detergent. Therefore, the most accurate characterization of Nonoxynol-9 is that it is a spermicide used in contraceptive methods, but it should not be relied upon for STI prevention.",
  "analysis": "Nonoxynol-9 is primarily recognized as a spermicide, which is a chemical that kills sperm to prevent pregnancy. It is not classified as a barrier contraceptive, which refers to physical methods like condoms that create a barrier to prevent sperm from reaching the egg. While Nonoxynol-9 can be used multiple times in a day, its use is not recommended for STI prevention due to limited effectiveness and potential irritation. Although it has detergent-like properties, it is not primarily used as a chemical detergent. Therefore, the most accurate option regarding Nonoxynol-9 is that it is a spermicide, but it does not effectively prevent STIs. Given these considerations, the best-supported option is that Nonoxynol-9 is a spermicide, which aligns with the consensus on its primary use.",
