Fragile X syndrome is a genetic disorder associated with intellectual disability and is also not classified as a glycogen storage disease.

  "analysis": "Glycogen storage diseases (GSDs) are specifically related to the abnormal metabolism of glycogen due to enzyme deficiencies. Krabbe's disease and Fabry's disease are both classified as lysosomal storage diseases, which involve different metabolic pathways and are not related to glycogen metabolism. Fragile X syndrome is a genetic disorder that affects intellectual development and is also not related to glycogen storage. Therefore, all the listed options (Krabbe's disease, Fabry's disease, and Fragile X syndrome) do not fall under the category of glycogen storage diseases.
