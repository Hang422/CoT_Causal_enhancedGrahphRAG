  "enhanced_information": "In patients who develop hepatitis while on anti-tubercular therapy (ATT), the safest drug combination is typically Streptomycin + Ethambutol. Ethambutol is known to have a lower risk of hepatotoxicity compared to Isoniazid and Rifampicin, which are both associated with liver damage. Therefore, the combination of Streptomycin and Ethambutol is preferred in this scenario, as it minimizes the risk of exacerbating liver issues. While all drug combinations have some level of risk, the consensus supports Ethambutol's relative safety in patients with liver impairment.",
  "analysis": "In patients who develop hepatitis while on anti-tubercular therapy (ATT), it is crucial to select a drug combination that minimizes the risk of further liver damage. Isoniazid and Rifampicin are both known for their hepatotoxic potential, making them less suitable in this context. Ethambutol, on the other hand, has a lower risk of hepatotoxicity. Therefore, the combination of Streptomycin (an injectable aminoglycoside) and Ethambutol is considered the safest option. This combination avoids the use of hepatotoxic drugs while still providing effective anti-tubercular coverage. The enhanced information aligns with this consensus, supporting the choice of Streptomycin + Ethambutol as the best option for patients with hepatitis during ATT.",
