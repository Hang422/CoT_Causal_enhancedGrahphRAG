  "enhanced_information": "Among the antitubercular drugs evaluated, Rifampicin is the safest option for use in severe renal failure. The reasoning chain for Rifampicin indicates that it is not primarily renally excreted, which aligns with the evidence that supports its safety in renal impairment (85% confidence). In contrast, Streptomycin and Capreomycin are both primarily excreted by the kidneys, leading to significant accumulation and increased risk of toxicity in renal failure (70% and 60% confidence, respectively). Ethambutol requires dose adjustment due to partial renal excretion, making it less safe without careful monitoring (80% confidence). Therefore, Rifampicin stands out as the most appropriate choice for patients with severe renal failure, while the other options pose higher risks of adverse effects.",
  "analysis": "The core medical issue is the safety of antitubercular drugs in patients with severe renal failure. Standard medical knowledge indicates that Rifampicin is primarily metabolized by the liver and is not significantly excreted by the kidneys, making it safer for use in patients with renal impairment. In contrast, Streptomycin and Capreomycin are primarily renally excreted, leading to a risk of accumulation and toxicity in patients with renal failure. Ethambutol also requires dose adjustment due to its renal excretion, which poses a risk without careful monitoring. The enhanced information supports this conclusion, indicating that Rifampicin is the safest option for patients with severe renal failure, while the other drugs present higher risks. Therefore, the reasoning leads to the conclusion that Rifampicin is the most appropriate choice in this scenario.",
