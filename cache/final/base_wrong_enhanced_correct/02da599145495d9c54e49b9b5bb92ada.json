  "enhanced_information": "Opioid-induced seizures can occur at therapeutic doses, particularly in sensitive populations such as children, who may have an increased susceptibility to the effects of opioids. While it is true that certain opioid agonists, particularly g-opioid agonists, are known to induce seizures, this is not exclusive to them, as other opioids can also contribute to seizure risk. Diazepam is commonly used for seizure management; however, it is not necessarily the drug of choice specifically for opioid-induced seizures, as the management may vary based on the clinical context. Therefore, the most accurate statements are that seizures can occur at therapeutic doses (option a) and that children are more susceptible (option b). Options c and d are less accurate due to the broader range of opioids that can cause seizures and the lack of specificity regarding the best treatment.",
  "analysis": "Opioid-induced seizures can occur at therapeutic doses, particularly in sensitive populations such as children, who may have an increased susceptibility to the effects of opioids. This aligns with standard medical knowledge that recognizes the potential for seizures even at normal dosing, especially in vulnerable groups. While certain g-opioid agonists are known to induce seizures, it is not exclusive to them, as other opioids can also contribute to seizure risk. Furthermore, while diazepam is commonly used for seizure management, it is not specifically the drug of choice for opioid-induced seizures, as treatment may vary based on the clinical context. Therefore, the most accurate statements are that seizures can occur at therapeutic doses (option a) and that children are more susceptible (option b). However, option b is more specific and directly addresses susceptibility, making it a stronger choice. Thus, the best answer is option b.",
