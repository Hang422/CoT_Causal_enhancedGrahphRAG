  "enhanced_information": "Glycoproteins consist of a core protein structure with carbohydrates attached via glycosidic bonds. These bonds are a fundamental aspect of glycoprotein biochemistry. The core structure of glycoproteins is protein, which supports functionalities such as cell recognition and signaling. The length of carbohydrate chains in glycoproteins can vary, making the statement about universally long sugar residues inaccurate.",
  "analysis": "Glycoproteins are characterized by their structure, which includes a core protein to which carbohydrate chains are attached. The attachment of these carbohydrates to the protein is indeed through glycosidic bonds, which is a fundamental aspect of their biochemistry. This confirms the accuracy of option 'opa'. Option 'opb' is also correct as it mentions the core protein, which is an essential component of glycoproteins. However, option 'opc' is less accurate because it generalizes that sugar residues are long in the carbohydrate portion of glycoproteins, which is not universally true as the length can vary significantly. Therefore, the most accurate and comprehensive option that aligns with medical consensus is 'opa', which directly addresses the specific biochemical linkages in glycoproteins.",
