  ],
  "enhanced_information": "Drugs causing hypokalemia include Amphotericin B, Insulin, and Carbenoxolone, all of which directly influence potassium excretion or cellular uptake leading to lower serum potassium levels. Cyclosporine may cause hypokalemia through indirect effects on renal function, but this is less certain. NSAIDs, contrary to causing hypokalemia, are typically associated with hyperkalemia and should not be considered in this context.",
  "analysis": "Amphotericin B, Insulin, and Carbenoxolone are well-documented to cause hypokalemia. Cyclosporine, while it can cause hypokalemia, is more commonly associated with hyperkalemia, and NSAIDs are generally linked to hyperkalemia. Therefore, the best-supported option considering the drugs directly and most commonly associated with hypokalemia is Amphotericin B, Insulin, and Carbenoxolone.",
