  "enhanced_information": "Propranolol is a non-selective beta-blocker with established uses in various conditions. For atrial flutter, it is effective in reducing heart rate and improving symptoms, aligning with consensus. In the case of thyrotoxicosis, propranolol is also beneficial as it alleviates symptoms like tachycardia, which is well-supported by clinical guidelines. However, while propranolol can help manage symptoms in some cases of Parkinsonian tremor, its efficacy is limited and it is not typically used as a first-line treatment, which contradicts the initial reasoning chain. Lastly, in hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM), propranolol can reduce outflow obstruction and improve exercise tolerance, making it a useful treatment option. Therefore, the option where propranolol is not useful is 'Parkinsonian tremor.'",
  "analysis": "Propranolol is a non-selective beta-blocker that is widely used for various medical conditions. In the case of atrial flutter (option a), propranolol is effective in controlling heart rate and is commonly used. For thyrotoxicosis (option c), propranolol helps manage symptoms such as tachycardia, which is well-documented in clinical practice. In hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM, option d), propranolol can reduce outflow obstruction and improve symptoms, making it a valid treatment option. However, for Parkinsonian tremor (option b), while propranolol may provide some symptomatic relief, it is not considered a first-line treatment and its efficacy is limited compared to other options like anticholinergics or beta-2 agonists. Therefore, the best-supported option where propranolol is not useful is 'Parkinsonian tremor.'",
