  "enhanced_information": "Glycogen storage diseases are a group of inherited metabolic disorders characterized by enzyme deficiencies that affect glycogen synthesis or breakdown. They include conditions such as Pompe disease and McArdle disease. Krabbe's disease is a lysosomal storage disorder caused by a deficiency in the enzyme galactocerebrosidase and is not classified as a glycogen storage disease. Similarly, Fabry's disease is a sphingolipidosis, which also does not involve glycogen metabolism. Fragile X syndrome is a genetic condition affecting mental development and is unrelated to glycogen storage. Therefore, all options listed (Krabbe's disease, Fabry's disease, and Fragile X syndrome) are not classified as glycogen storage diseases.",
  "analysis": "Glycogen storage diseases are specifically related to enzyme deficiencies that affect glycogen metabolism. The options provided include Krabbe's disease, Fabry's disease, and Fragile X syndrome. Krabbe's disease is a lysosomal storage disorder, Fabry's disease is a sphingolipidosis, and Fragile X syndrome is a genetic condition affecting mental development. None of these conditions are classified as glycogen storage diseases. Therefore, the correct answer is that all the listed options are not glycogen storage diseases.",
