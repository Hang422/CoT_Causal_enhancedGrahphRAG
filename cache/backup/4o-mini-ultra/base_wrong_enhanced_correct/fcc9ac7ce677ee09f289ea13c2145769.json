  "enhanced_information": "Cardiac muscle primarily utilizes fatty acids as its main energy source under normal conditions, as they are abundant in the bloodstream and undergo beta-oxidation to produce ATP efficiently. While glucose can also be metabolized via glycolysis to generate ATP, it is generally less preferred than fatty acids. Ketone bodies can serve as an alternative energy source, particularly during fasting, as they are converted to acetyl-CoA and enter the Krebs cycle for ATP production. Therefore, cardiac muscle is adaptable and can utilize any of these substrates based on availability, but fatty acids remain the predominant source of energy. This aligns with the consensus that fatty acids are the primary energy source for cardiac muscle under normal physiological conditions.",
  "analysis": "The primary energy source for cardiac muscle under normal physiological conditions is fatty acids, which are metabolized through beta-oxidation to produce ATP efficiently. While glucose and ketone bodies can also be utilized, they are generally less preferred compared to fatty acids. The heart is capable of adapting to different energy substrates based on their availability, but the consensus in the literature supports that fatty acids are the predominant source of energy for cardiac muscle. Therefore, while all three options can serve as energy sources, fatty acids are the most significant under normal conditions.",
