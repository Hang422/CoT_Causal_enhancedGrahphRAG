  "enhanced_information": "Renin is produced by juxtaglomerular cells in the kidneys, confirming it is part of the renal system. Angiotensin I is not directly produced by the renal system; it is formed from angiotensinogen, which is produced by the liver, and requires renin for its conversion. Erythropoietin is produced by interstitial fibroblasts in the kidneys, making it part of the renal system. 1,25-Dihydroxycholecalciferol (1,25DHCC), the active form of vitamin D, is produced in the kidneys from calcidiol, thus also part of the renal system. Therefore, the peptide not produced by the renal system is Angiotensin I.",
  "analysis": "To determine which peptide is not produced by the renal system, we analyze each option: Renin is produced by juxtaglomerular cells in the kidneys, confirming it is part of the renal system. Angiotensin I is formed from angiotensinogen, which is produced by the liver, and requires renin for its conversion; thus, it is not directly produced by the renal system. Erythropoietin is produced by interstitial fibroblasts in the kidneys, making it part of the renal system. 1,25-Dihydroxycholecalciferol (1,25DHCC) is produced in the kidneys from calcidiol, confirming it is also part of the renal system. Therefore, the peptide that is not produced by the renal system is Angiotensin I, as it is a product of a reaction involving a liver-derived precursor and renin from the kidneys.",
