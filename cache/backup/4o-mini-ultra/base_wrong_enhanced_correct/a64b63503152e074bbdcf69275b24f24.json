  "enhanced_information": "The therapeutic range of theophylline is widely accepted to be between 10-20 micrograms per L. This is supported by the understanding that theophylline has a narrow therapeutic index, making monitoring critical for efficacy and safety. Therefore, options opb (10-May), opc (15-May), and opd (20-May) fall within this therapeutic range, while option opa (0-5) is too low to be considered therapeutic. The evidence paths regarding theophylline's interactions and therapeutic uses, while broad, do not contradict this consensus and reinforce the importance of maintaining levels within the therapeutic range to avoid toxicity and ensure efficacy.",
  "analysis": "The therapeutic range of theophylline is well-established in clinical pharmacology, typically cited as being between 10-20 micrograms per liter. This range is critical due to theophylline's narrow therapeutic index, where levels below 10 may not provide therapeutic effects, and levels above 20 may lead to toxicity. Given the options provided, opb (10-May), opc (15-May), and opd (20-May) all fall within the accepted therapeutic range, while opa (0-5) is clearly below the therapeutic threshold. Therefore, the best-supported options are opb, opc, and opd, but since the question asks for the therapeutic range, the most accurate representation of the upper limit of this range is option opd (20-May). Thus, the final answer is based on the highest value within the therapeutic range.",
