  "enhanced_information": "Aldosterone is recognized as the most potent mineralocorticoid, primarily regulating sodium and potassium balance in the body. Deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA) is also a mineralocorticoid but is less potent than aldosterone. Fludrocortisone is a synthetic mineralocorticoid used for its effects but is not as potent as aldosterone. Triamcinolone, on the other hand, is classified as a glucocorticoid and does not possess mineralocorticoid potency. Therefore, the consensus supports that aldosterone is the most potent mineralocorticoid.",
  "analysis": "Aldosterone is widely recognized as the most potent mineralocorticoid, primarily responsible for regulating sodium and potassium levels in the body. Deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA) is a mineralocorticoid but is considered less potent than aldosterone. Fludrocortisone, while a synthetic mineralocorticoid, is also not as potent as aldosterone. Triamcinolone is a glucocorticoid and does not have mineralocorticoid activity. Therefore, based on established pharmacological principles and consensus, aldosterone is the most potent mineralocorticoid.",
