  "enhanced_information": "Arachidonic acid is an unsaturated fatty acid that can increase membrane fluidity due to its kinked structure, which prevents tight packing of lipids, thus enhancing cell signaling. Cholesterol, while important for maintaining membrane integrity, actually decreases fluidity at high concentrations by filling spaces between phospholipids, leading to increased rigidity. Both palmitic acid and stearic acid are saturated fatty acids, which contribute to decreased membrane fluidity and increased rigidity due to their straight-chain structure that allows for tight packing. Therefore, the correct answer to the question is 'Arachidonic acid' as it is the only option that increases plasma membrane fluidity.",
  "analysis": "The fluidity of the plasma membrane is influenced by the types of fatty acids and cholesterol present. Arachidonic acid is an unsaturated fatty acid, which introduces kinks in the fatty acid chains, preventing tight packing and thereby increasing membrane fluidity. Cholesterol, while it plays a crucial role in membrane structure, tends to decrease fluidity at high concentrations by filling spaces between phospholipids, leading to increased rigidity. Both palmitic acid and stearic acid are saturated fatty acids, which promote tight packing and thus decrease fluidity. Given this information, the most likely correct answer is 'Arachidonic acid' as it is the only option that is known to increase plasma membrane fluidity.",
