  "enhanced_information": "In evaluating the safety of antitubercular drugs in severe renal failure, the following consensus points apply: \n\n1. **Streptomycin**: This drug is primarily excreted by the kidneys, leading to potential accumulation and toxicity in patients with severe renal failure. Therefore, it is not recommended for use in this population. \n\n2. **Ethambutol**: Ethambutol is partially renally excreted, and while dose adjustment is necessary in renal failure, it can be used with caution. This aligns with the consensus that careful monitoring and adjustment can mitigate risks. \n\n3. **Capreomycin**: Similar to streptomycin, capreomycin is excreted by the kidneys and poses a risk of nephrotoxicity, making it unsuitable for patients with severe renal failure. \n\n4. **Rifampicin**: This drug is primarily metabolized by the liver with minimal renal excretion, making it generally safe for use in patients with renal failure. \n\nIn summary, Ethambutol can be used with caution with dose adjustments, while Rifampicin is considered safe. Streptomycin and Capreomycin are not recommended due to the risk of toxicity in severe renal failure.",
  "analysis": "In evaluating the safety of antitubercular drugs in patients with severe renal failure, we consider the pharmacokinetics and potential toxicity of each drug. Streptomycin and Capreomycin are both primarily excreted by the kidneys, which increases the risk of accumulation and toxicity in patients with renal impairment, making them unsuitable for use in severe renal failure. Ethambutol is partially renally excreted and requires dose adjustment, but it can be used with caution in this population. Rifampicin, on the other hand, is mainly metabolized by the liver and has minimal renal excretion, making it generally safe for use in patients with renal failure. Therefore, the best-supported option for safe use in severe renal failure is Rifampicin.",
