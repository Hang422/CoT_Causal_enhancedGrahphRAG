  "enhanced_information": "5'-nucleotidase, adenylyl cyclase, and Na+-K+-ATPase are all recognized as enzymatic markers of the plasma membrane due to their roles in nucleotide metabolism, signal transduction, and maintaining membrane potential, respectively. In contrast, galactosyl transferase is primarily associated with the Golgi apparatus and is not typically considered a plasma membrane enzyme. Therefore, the correct answer is galactosyl transferase, as it does not belong to the group of enzymatic markers of the plasma membrane.",
  "analysis": "The question asks for enzymatic markers of the plasma membrane. 5'-nucleotidase, adenylyl cyclase, and Na+-K+-ATPase are all well-established as markers associated with the plasma membrane due to their roles in various physiological processes. 5'-nucleotidase is involved in nucleotide metabolism, adenylyl cyclase is crucial for signal transduction, and Na+-K+-ATPase is essential for maintaining the membrane potential and ion gradients. In contrast, galactosyl transferase is primarily located in the Golgi apparatus and is involved in glycosylation processes, not directly associated with the plasma membrane. Therefore, the correct answer is galactosyl transferase, as it does not fit the criteria of being an enzymatic marker of the plasma membrane.",
