  "enhanced_information": "Iron absorption occurs primarily in the duodenum, with some absorption also taking place in the jejunum. The stomach contributes to the acidic environment necessary for optimal iron absorption, but the majority of absorption happens in the duodenum. Therefore, the most accurate option is 'Duodenum + Jejunum' as it reflects the primary and secondary sites of iron absorption. Evidence supports that dietary iron requires an acidic environment, which is provided by the stomach, but the effective absorption occurs mainly in the duodenum.",
  "analysis": "Iron absorption primarily occurs in the duodenum, with some absorption also taking place in the jejunum. The stomach plays a role in creating an acidic environment that enhances iron solubility and absorption, but it is not the primary site of absorption. Given the options, 'Duodenum + Jejunum' accurately reflects the main sites of iron absorption, while 'Duodenum' alone does not account for the absorption that occurs in the jejunum. Therefore, the best-supported option is 'Duodenum + Jejunum'.",
