  "enhanced_information": "Lithium is a first-line treatment for acute manic episodes in bipolar disorder and can be used as monotherapy, making option (a) true. Monitoring serum concentration of lithium is crucial for guiding dose adjustments to ensure efficacy and safety, contradicting option (b). While lithium can affect blood cell counts, leucocytosis is not a common side effect, which makes option (c) less reliable. Long-term use of lithium is associated with hypothyroidism, but hyperthyroidism is less common and not a standard risk, thus option (d) is misleading. Therefore, the correct statement regarding the use of lithium in manic-depressive psychosis is that it can be used as monotherapy for acute episodes.",
  "analysis": "Lithium is indeed a first-line treatment for acute manic episodes in bipolar disorder, and it can be used as monotherapy, which supports option (a). Monitoring serum concentration of lithium is critical for ensuring therapeutic levels and avoiding toxicity, making option (b) incorrect. While lithium can affect blood cell counts, leucocytosis is not a common side effect, which makes option (c) less reliable. Long-term use of lithium is more commonly associated with hypothyroidism rather than hyperthyroidism, thus option (d) is misleading. Therefore, the most accurate statement regarding the use of lithium in manic-depressive psychosis is that it can be used as monotherapy for acute episodes.",
