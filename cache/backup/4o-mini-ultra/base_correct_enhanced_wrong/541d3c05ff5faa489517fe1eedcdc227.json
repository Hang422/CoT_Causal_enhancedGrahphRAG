  "enhanced_information": "Chloroquine is primarily used for malaria treatment and is not associated with myopathy, making it the best option. Betamethasone, a corticosteroid, is known to potentially cause muscle weakness and is associated with myopathy. Chloramphenicol, while an antibiotic, rarely causes myopathy, but it is still a possible risk. Zidovudine, used for HIV treatment, is well-documented to cause myopathy and muscle damage. Therefore, the consensus indicates that Chloroquine does not cause myopathy.",
  "analysis": "Chloroquine is primarily used for the treatment of malaria and is not commonly associated with myopathy. In contrast, Betamethasone, a corticosteroid, can lead to muscle weakness and myopathy, especially with long-term use. Chloramphenicol is an antibiotic that has a rare association with myopathy, but it is not as well-documented as the other options. Zidovudine is known to cause myopathy and muscle damage, particularly in long-term use for HIV treatment. Given this information, Chloroquine stands out as the drug least likely to cause myopathy, aligning with the consensus in the medical literature.",
