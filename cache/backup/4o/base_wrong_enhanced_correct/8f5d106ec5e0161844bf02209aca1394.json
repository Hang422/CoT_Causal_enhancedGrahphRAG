  "enhanced_information": "Folic acid metabolism can be inhibited by several agents through different mechanisms. Methotrexate is well-known to inhibit dihydrofolate reductase, leading to decreased tetrahydrofolate and thus inhibiting folic acid metabolism, which is strongly supported by consensus and evidence. Trimethoprim also inhibits dihydrofolate reductase, similarly affecting folic acid metabolism. Nitrous oxide oxidizes vitamin B12, impairing methionine synthase, which indirectly affects folate metabolism, aligning with consensus. Sulfonamides inhibit dihydropteroate synthase, reducing folate synthesis, but this primarily affects bacterial folate metabolism rather than human folic acid metabolism. 5-Flucytosine is converted to 5-fluorouracil, which inhibits thymidylate synthase, but its effect on folate metabolism is less direct and not primarily recognized in standard consensus. Therefore, the most consensus-supported inhibitors of folic acid metabolism are Methotrexate, Trimethoprim, and Nitrous Oxide, corresponding to option 'opb. abd'.",
