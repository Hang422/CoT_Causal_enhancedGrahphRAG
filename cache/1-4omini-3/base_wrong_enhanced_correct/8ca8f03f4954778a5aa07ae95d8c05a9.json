  "enhanced_information": "The statement that is false regarding Sickle Cell Disease is 'opc. 'Sticky patch' is generated as a result of replacement of a non-polar residue with a polar residue.' In reality, the mutation in Sickle Cell Disease involves a single nucleotide change that results in the substitution of Glutamic acid (a polar residue) with Valine (a non-polar residue), creating a 'sticky patch' that promotes hemoglobin polymerization under low oxygen conditions. This aligns with the reasoning chain indicating that the amino acid change is crucial to the disease's pathology. The other statements are true: the single nucleotide change does occur, RFLP can be used to identify this mutation, and HbS does confer a selective advantage against malaria in heterozygotes. Therefore, the correct answer is option 'opc.'",
  "analysis": "Sickle cell disease is caused by a single nucleotide mutation in the HBB gene, which leads to the substitution of Glutamic acid (a polar residue) with Valine (a non-polar residue) in the beta-globin chain of hemoglobin. This mutation creates a 'sticky patch' that promotes polymerization of deoxygenated hemoglobin, leading to the characteristic sickle shape of red blood cells. The statement 'opc. 'Sticky patch' is generated as a result of replacement of a non-polar residue with a polar residue' is incorrect because it misrepresents the nature of the amino acid substitution. The other statements are accurate: the mutation can be identified using RFLP techniques, and individuals with HbS (sickle hemoglobin) do have a selective advantage against malaria in the heterozygous state. Therefore, the false statement is option 'opc.'",
