  "enhanced_information": "Based on the evaluation of the available options for orally effective drugs in candidiasis, Itraconazole and Ketoconazole emerge as the most viable candidates. Both have strong reasoning chains supported by path evidence indicating their effectiveness against candidiasis. Itraconazole is recognized for its broad-spectrum antifungal activity, making it a strong choice (75% confidence). Ketoconazole is also effective against fungal infections, including candidiasis, with a slightly lower confidence level (80%). Clotrimazole and Micanozole are primarily topical agents with limited oral bioavailability, making them less suitable for oral treatment of candidiasis (60% and 50% confidence, respectively). Therefore, Itraconazole and Ketoconazole are prioritized for their oral effectiveness in treating candidiasis, while Clotrimazole and Micanozole are deprioritized due to their limited efficacy in this context.",
  "analysis": "Candidiasis is a fungal infection caused by Candida species, and effective treatment often requires antifungal medications. Among the options provided, Itraconazole and Ketoconazole are both known to be effective when administered orally for treating candidiasis. Itraconazole is recognized for its broad-spectrum antifungal activity, making it a strong choice for systemic fungal infections, including candidiasis. Ketoconazole is also effective against fungal infections, including candidiasis, but is generally considered less favorable due to potential side effects and drug interactions. Clotrimazole and Micanozole are primarily topical agents and have limited oral bioavailability, making them unsuitable for oral treatment of candidiasis. Therefore, the most clinically valid choice for an orally effective drug in candidiasis is Itraconazole, supported by both standard medical knowledge and enhanced information.",
