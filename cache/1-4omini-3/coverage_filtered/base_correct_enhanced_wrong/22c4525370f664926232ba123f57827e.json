  "enhanced_information": "Ketorolac is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) primarily used for its analgesic properties, particularly in postoperative pain management. The strongest reasoning chain indicates that ketorolac does not primarily act on opioid receptors, which is supported by evidence showing it does not interact with opioid receptors (80% confidence). While it has potent anti-inflammatory activity (70% confidence), its analgesic efficacy is not equal to morphine; rather, it is effective but generally considered less potent than opioids (60% confidence). Additionally, while ketorolac can be used for pain management, its specific use as a preanaesthetic analgesic is less common and lacks strong supporting evidence (65% confidence). Therefore, the most accurate statement is that ketorolac has potent anti-inflammatory activity, but it does not interact with opioid receptors, which is critical for understanding its pharmacological profile.",
  "analysis": "Ketorolac is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) primarily used for its analgesic properties, especially in postoperative pain management. The options presented need to be evaluated based on established pharmacological knowledge. Option 'opa' states that ketorolac has potent anti-inflammatory activity, which is true as it is known for its anti-inflammatory effects. Option 'opb' claims that its analgesic efficacy is equal to morphine in postoperative pain; however, while ketorolac is effective, it is generally considered less potent than opioids like morphine. Option 'opc' suggests that it is used as a preanaesthetic analgesic, which is not a common indication for ketorolac. Lastly, option 'opd' states that it interacts with opioid receptors, which is incorrect as ketorolac does not act on these receptors. Therefore, the most accurate statement is that ketorolac has potent anti-inflammatory activity, making option 'opa' the correct choice.",
