  "enhanced_information": "Tolerance to morphine occurs for most of its side effects, but the euphoric effect is less likely to develop tolerance compared to others. Evidence suggests that while sedation, constipation, and pain relief show significant tolerance development (80-90%), the euphoric effect may not diminish as much over time (60-75%). This is supported by reasoning chains indicating that euphoria has a lower likelihood of developing tolerance, with an overall analysis suggesting that euphoria is less likely to develop tolerance compared to sedation and constipation. Therefore, the correct answer is that tolerance does not occur to the euphoric effect of morphine.",
  "analysis": "Morphine is an opioid that can lead to tolerance for many of its effects over time. Tolerance refers to the body's reduced response to a drug after repeated use. In the case of morphine, tolerance develops significantly for sedation, constipation, and pain relief, with studies indicating that 80-90% of patients experience this tolerance. However, the euphoric effect of morphine is less likely to develop tolerance, with estimates suggesting that only 60-75% of patients experience a decrease in this effect over time. Therefore, while sedation, constipation, and pain relief show substantial tolerance, the euphoric effect is the exception. This reasoning aligns with both standard medical knowledge and the enhanced information provided, leading to the conclusion that tolerance does not occur to the euphoric effect of morphine.",
