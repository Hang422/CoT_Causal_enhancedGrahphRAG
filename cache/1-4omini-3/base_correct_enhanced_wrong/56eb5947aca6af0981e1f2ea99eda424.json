  "enhanced_information": "The clinical presentation of a 2-year-old intellectually disabled child with blue eyes, blonde hair, fair skin, and a peculiar body odour strongly suggests Isovaleric aciduria. This condition is characterized by a distinctive body odour reminiscent of sweaty feet, which aligns with the child's symptoms. While Phenylketonuria (PKU) is associated with intellectual disability, it does not typically present with a specific body odour, making it less likely. Maple Syrup Urine Disease (MSUD) and Canavan's disease also do not correlate well with the peculiar body odour or the physical traits described. Therefore, Isovaleric aciduria is the most consistent diagnosis based on the strongest reasoning chain and supporting evidence, with a confidence level of 90%.",
