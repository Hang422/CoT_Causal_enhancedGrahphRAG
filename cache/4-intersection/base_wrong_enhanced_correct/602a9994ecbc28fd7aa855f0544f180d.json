  "enhanced_information": "Propranolol, a non-selective beta-blocker, effectively reduces heart rate and contractility, making it useful in atrial flutter and thyrotoxicosis. However, its role in Parkinsonian tremor is not well-supported, as this condition primarily stems from dopamine deficiency rather than excessive sympathetic activity. In HOCM, propranolol may worsen symptoms by increasing ventricular filling time and exacerbating outflow obstruction, making it generally not recommended.",
  "analysis": "Propranolol is least effective in Parkinsonian tremor because the tremor in Parkinson's disease is primarily due to dopamine deficiency rather than sympathetic overactivity, making beta-blockers not the first-line treatment. This decision aligns with both standard medical knowledge and the enhanced information provided.",
