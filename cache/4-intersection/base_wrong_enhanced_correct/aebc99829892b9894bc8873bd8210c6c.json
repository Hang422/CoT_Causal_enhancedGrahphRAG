Morphine also poses risks due to the accumulation of morphine-6-glucuronide, leading to potential respiratory depression and sedation. Fentanyl and atracurium are safer alternatives in renal failure, with fentanyl metabolized primarily by the liver and atracurium undergoing Hofmann elimination, independent of renal function.",
