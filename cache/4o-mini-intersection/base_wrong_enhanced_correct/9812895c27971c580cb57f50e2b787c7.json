Fine-needle biopsy of subcutaneous abdominal fat is indeed a simple and reliable method for diagnosing secondary systemic amyloidosis, supported by clinical practice. 3. Hepatic amyloid disease can cause hepatomegaly, but jaundice is indeed uncommon, aligning with consensus. 4. While amyloidosis of the spleen can lead to splenomegaly, it is not typically associated with severe anemia, which contradicts the known associations. Therefore, the statement regarding amyloidosis of the spleen being associated with severe anemia is the one that is not true.",
  "analysis": "To determine which statement about amyloidosis is not true, we analyze each option based on established medical knowledge. Option 'opa' states that amyloidosis associated with multiple myeloma has the poorest prognosis, which is consistent with the literature. Option 'opb' claims that fine-needle biopsy of subcutaneous abdominal fat is a reliable method for diagnosing secondary systemic amyloidosis, which is also supported by clinical practice. Option 'opc' mentions that hepatic amyloid disease produces hepatomegaly but rarely jaundice, which aligns with known clinical presentations. Finally, option 'opd' states that amyloidosis of the spleen is associated with severe anemia. However, while splenic involvement can occur, it is not typically linked to severe anemia, making this statement the least accurate. Therefore, the statement regarding amyloidosis of the spleen being associated with severe anemia is the one that is not true.",
