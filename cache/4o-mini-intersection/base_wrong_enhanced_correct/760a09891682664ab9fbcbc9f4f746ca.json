  "enhanced_information": "Aldosterone is recognized as the most potent mineralocorticoid, primarily regulating sodium and potassium balance in the body. While DOCA (Deoxycorticosterone Acetate) is also a mineralocorticoid, it is less potent than aldosterone. Fludrocortisone is a synthetic mineralocorticoid that is more potent than cortisol but still not as potent as aldosterone. Triamcinolone, on the other hand, is a glucocorticoid and does not possess mineralocorticoid activity. Therefore, the consensus supports that aldosterone is the most potent mineralocorticoid.",
  "analysis": "Aldosterone is widely recognized as the most potent mineralocorticoid, primarily responsible for regulating sodium and potassium levels in the body. While DOCA (Deoxycorticosterone Acetate) and fludrocortisone are also mineralocorticoids, they are not as potent as aldosterone. Triamcinolone is a glucocorticoid and does not have mineralocorticoid activity. The consensus in pharmacology supports that aldosterone is the most potent mineralocorticoid, making it the best-supported option in this context.",
