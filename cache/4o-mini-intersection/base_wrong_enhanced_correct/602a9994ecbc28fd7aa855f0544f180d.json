  "enhanced_information": "Propranolol is a non-selective beta-blocker commonly used for various conditions. It is effective in managing atrial flutter by controlling heart rate and rhythm. In the case of thyrotoxicosis, propranolol helps alleviate symptoms such as tachycardia and tremors, making it beneficial in this context. However, it is not primarily indicated for Parkinsonian tremor, as other treatments are preferred for this condition. Regarding hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM), propranolol is indeed indicated as it helps reduce left ventricular outflow obstruction. Therefore, the correct answer is that propranolol is not useful for Parkinsonian tremor.",
  "analysis": "Propranolol is a non-selective beta-blocker that is effective in various clinical scenarios. It is commonly used to manage atrial flutter by controlling heart rate and rhythm. In thyrotoxicosis, it alleviates symptoms such as tachycardia and tremors, making it beneficial. For hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM), propranolol helps reduce left ventricular outflow obstruction, thus it is indicated. However, for Parkinsonian tremor, propranolol is not the first-line treatment; other medications such as anticholinergics or dopaminergic agents are preferred. Therefore, the option that propranolol is not useful for is Parkinsonian tremor.",
