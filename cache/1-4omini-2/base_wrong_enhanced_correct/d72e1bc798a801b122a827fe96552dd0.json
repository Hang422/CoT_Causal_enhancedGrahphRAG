  "enhanced_information": "In patients who develop hepatitis while on anti-tubercular therapy (ATT), the combination of Streptomycin + Ethambutol is the safest option. Reasoning chains indicate that Isoniazid significantly increases the risk of liver toxicity, making it a poor choice in this context (70% risk). Ethambutol is generally well-tolerated in liver impairment (85% safety), while Rifampicin is known to exacerbate liver enzyme elevation (60% risk). Although Streptomycin has limited liver involvement (75% safety), the combination with Ethambutol is supported by evidence showing Ethambutol's favorable safety profile in liver disease. Therefore, the combination of Streptomycin + Ethambutol is prioritized due to its overall safety and tolerability in patients with hepatitis.",
  "analysis": "The core medical issue is the safety of anti-tubercular drug combinations in a patient who has developed hepatitis while on anti-tubercular therapy (ATT). Standard medical knowledge indicates that Isoniazid is known to cause significant liver toxicity, making it a poor choice for patients with liver impairment. Ethambutol is generally well-tolerated in patients with liver issues, while Rifampicin can exacerbate liver enzyme elevation. Streptomycin has limited liver involvement but is not as commonly used in modern ATT regimens. The enhanced information supports the idea that the combination of Streptomycin + Ethambutol is the safest option due to Ethambutol's favorable safety profile in liver disease. Therefore, the combination of Streptomycin + Ethambutol is prioritized for its overall safety and tolerability in patients with hepatitis.",
