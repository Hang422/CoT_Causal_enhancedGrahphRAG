Isoniazid also has a significant link (80%), while penicillin shows a moderate association (70%). Sulphonamide presents the weakest connection (50%) and lacks clear path evidence, making it the least likely to cause SLE-like syndrome. Therefore, the correct answer is sulphonamide, as it is the only option that does not have a well-established link to SLE-like syndrome.",
  "analysis": "Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) can be induced by certain medications, leading to a lupus-like syndrome. Among the options provided, hydralazine and isoniazid are well-documented to cause drug-induced lupus, with hydralazine having a strong association. Penicillin has a moderate association with SLE-like syndrome, while sulphonamides have the weakest connection and lack clear evidence linking them to SLE-like syndrome. Therefore, based on standard medical knowledge and the enhanced information, sulphonamide is the only drug listed that does not have a well-established link to SLE-like syndrome, making it the correct answer.",
