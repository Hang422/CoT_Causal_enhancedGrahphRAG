  "enhanced_information": "Ethacrynic acid is primarily avoided due to its association with renal toxicity, which is supported by strong reasoning chains indicating that this adverse effect significantly limits its clinical use (85% confidence). Additionally, there is a notable risk of ototoxicity (75% confidence), particularly in patients with pre-existing hearing issues or those receiving other ototoxic medications. Gastrointestinal toxicity is also reported (70% confidence), which can adversely affect patient compliance. However, pulmonary toxicity is not commonly linked to ethacrynic acid and is less relevant in clinical considerations (60% confidence). Therefore, the most critical reasons for the limited use of ethacrynic acid are renal and ototoxicity, with renal toxicity being the primary concern.",
  "analysis": "Ethacrynic acid is a loop diuretic that is primarily avoided due to its association with renal toxicity. This is a well-established fact in pharmacology, as loop diuretics can lead to electrolyte imbalances and acute kidney injury, particularly in susceptible populations. Enhanced information supports this by indicating a strong confidence (85%) in renal toxicity being a significant limiting factor for its clinical use. Additionally, while ototoxicity is also a concern (75% confidence), especially in patients with pre-existing conditions or those on other ototoxic drugs, it is not the primary reason for avoiding ethacrynic acid. Gastrointestinal toxicity is noted but is less critical compared to renal and ototoxicity. Pulmonary toxicity is not a recognized issue with ethacrynic acid. Therefore, the most clinically relevant reason for the limited use of ethacrynic acid is renal toxicity.",
