  "enhanced_information": "Aldosterone primarily acts on the distal tubules and collecting ducts of the nephron. The strongest reasoning chains indicate that aldosterone increases sodium reabsorption and potassium excretion, leading to elevated blood volume and potential hypokalemia. Specifically, aldosterone enhances water retention through its action on the distal tubules (85% confidence) and increases aquaporin expression in the collecting duct, significantly improving water reabsorption (90% confidence). While there is some uncertainty regarding its effects on the proximal tubule, the evidence suggests that its primary and most clinically relevant actions occur in the distal tubules and collecting duct. Therefore, the most likely answer is 'opb. Distal tubules' and 'opd. Collecting duct', with a stronger emphasis on the collecting duct due to its critical role in water reabsorption.",
  "analysis": "Aldosterone is a steroid hormone produced by the adrenal cortex that plays a crucial role in regulating sodium and potassium levels in the body. It primarily acts on the distal tubules and collecting ducts of the nephron. The standard medical knowledge confirms that aldosterone increases sodium reabsorption and promotes potassium excretion, which is essential for maintaining blood pressure and fluid balance. Enhanced information supports this by indicating that aldosterone's action leads to increased aquaporin expression in the collecting duct, enhancing water reabsorption. While there may be some minor effects on the proximal tubule, the predominant and clinically significant actions of aldosterone are in the distal tubules and collecting duct. Therefore, the most accurate answer is that aldosterone acts on both the distal tubules and the collecting duct, but with a stronger emphasis on the collecting duct due to its critical role in water reabsorption. However, since the question asks for a single option, the best choice is 'opd. Collecting duct'.",
