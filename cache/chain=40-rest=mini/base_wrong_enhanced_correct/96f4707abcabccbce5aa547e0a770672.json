  "enhanced_information": "Tamoxifen is associated with several adverse effects. It is known to increase the risk of thromboembolism and endometrial carcinoma, both of which are well-documented in clinical literature. The risk of cataracts is also noted, although the evidence is less definitive. However, tamoxifen is generally considered to have a protective effect against the development of carcinoma in the contralateral breast, which contradicts the notion that it causes this condition. Therefore, the correct answer to the question regarding which adverse effect is not caused by tamoxifen is carcinoma in the contralateral breast.",
  "analysis": "Tamoxifen is a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) commonly used in the treatment of estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer. It is associated with several adverse effects, including an increased risk of thromboembolism (opa), endometrial carcinoma (opb), and cataracts (opd). However, regarding carcinoma in the contralateral breast (opc), tamoxifen is generally considered to have a protective effect against the development of breast cancer in the opposite breast. This is supported by clinical studies indicating that tamoxifen reduces the risk of contralateral breast cancer. Therefore, the most likely correct answer to the question of which adverse effect is not caused by tamoxifen is carcinoma in the contralateral breast.",
