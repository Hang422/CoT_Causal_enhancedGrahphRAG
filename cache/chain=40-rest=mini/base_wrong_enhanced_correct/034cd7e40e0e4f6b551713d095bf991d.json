  "enhanced_information": "The dorsal column of the spinal cord primarily carries proprioception, vibratory sense, and fine touch sensations. Heat sensation, however, is transmitted via the spinothalamic tract, which is distinct from the dorsal column pathway. Therefore, the correct answer to the question of which sensation is not carried in the dorsal column is 'Heat sensation'. The evidence regarding the dorsal funiculus supports the role of the dorsal column in carrying these modalities, confirming the consensus on sensory pathways.",
  "analysis": "The dorsal column of the spinal cord is responsible for transmitting proprioception, vibratory sense, and fine touch sensations. In contrast, heat sensation is carried by the spinothalamic tract, which is a separate pathway. This distinction is well-established in neuroanatomy and physiology. Therefore, the option that is not carried in the dorsal column is heat sensation. The evidence supports this conclusion, confirming that the dorsal column does not transmit heat sensation, making it the correct answer.",
