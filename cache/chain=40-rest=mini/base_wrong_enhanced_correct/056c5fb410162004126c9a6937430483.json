  "enhanced_information": "The drug of choice for both gonococcal and non-gonococcal urethritis is Azithromycin. Azithromycin is effective against Chlamydia trachomatis, which is a common cause of non-gonococcal urethritis, and it also has activity against Neisseria gonorrhoeae, the causative agent of gonococcal urethritis. Clindamycin is not effective against either pathogen, and thus is not suitable for treating urethritis. Cefepime, while a broad-spectrum cephalosporin, is not typically used for urethritis. Metronidazole is effective against anaerobic bacteria but does not cover the pathogens responsible for urethritis. Therefore, Azithromycin is the most appropriate choice.",
  "analysis": "The treatment of urethritis, both gonococcal and non-gonococcal, typically involves antibiotics that are effective against the causative pathogens. Gonococcal urethritis is primarily caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae, while non-gonococcal urethritis is often due to Chlamydia trachomatis. Azithromycin is a macrolide antibiotic that is effective against Chlamydia and has some activity against Neisseria gonorrhoeae, making it a suitable choice for treating both types of urethritis. Clindamycin is not effective against these pathogens, Cefepime is not commonly used for urethritis, and Metronidazole does not cover the relevant bacteria. Therefore, Azithromycin is the most appropriate choice based on current medical guidelines and consensus.",
