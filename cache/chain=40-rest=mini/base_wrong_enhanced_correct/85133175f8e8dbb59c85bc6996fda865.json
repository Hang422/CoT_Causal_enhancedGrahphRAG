  "enhanced_information": "Hyperprolactinemia is primarily associated with medications that block dopamine receptors, leading to increased prolactin secretion. Metoclopramide is a dopamine receptor antagonist, which can cause hyperprolactinemia due to its mechanism of action. In contrast, Bromocriptine is a dopamine agonist that decreases prolactin secretion, making it unlikely to cause hyperprolactinemia. Levodopa, as a dopamine precursor, and Amantadine, which stimulates dopamine release, also lead to increased dopamine levels and are unlikely to cause hyperprolactinemia. Therefore, the only option that aligns with the consensus on causing hyperprolactinemia is Metoclopramide.",
  "analysis": "Hyperprolactinemia is primarily caused by medications that block dopamine receptors, leading to increased prolactin secretion. Among the options provided, Metoclopramide is a known dopamine receptor antagonist, which can indeed cause hyperprolactinemia due to its mechanism of action. In contrast, Bromocriptine is a dopamine agonist that reduces prolactin levels, making it unlikely to cause hyperprolactinemia. Levodopa and Amantadine, while related to dopamine, do not typically lead to increased prolactin levels. Therefore, the most supported option that aligns with the consensus on causing hyperprolactinemia is Metoclopramide.",
