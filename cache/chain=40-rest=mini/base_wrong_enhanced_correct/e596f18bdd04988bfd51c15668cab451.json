  "enhanced_information": "Secretin is primarily known for its role in stimulating the pancreas to increase the secretion of bicarbonate, which helps neutralize gastric acid in the duodenum. This aligns with the consensus that the most important action of secretin is to increase bicarbonate secretion by the pancreas (Option B). While secretin does have some effects on gastric secretion and interacts with the pyloric sphincter, these actions are secondary and less significant compared to its primary function. Therefore, the most accurate and consensus-supported answer is that secretin increases the secretion of bicarbonates by the pancreas.",
  "analysis": "Secretin is a hormone produced by the S cells in the duodenum in response to acidic chyme entering from the stomach. Its primary role is to stimulate the pancreas to secrete bicarbonate, which neutralizes gastric acid in the duodenum, creating a more alkaline environment suitable for enzymatic digestion. While secretin does have secondary effects, such as decreasing gastric secretion and influencing the pyloric sphincter, these are not its primary functions. The consensus in the medical literature supports that the most important action of secretin is indeed to increase the secretion of bicarbonates by the pancreas. Therefore, the best-supported option is 'increase secretion of bicarbonates by pancreas' (Option B).",
