  "enhanced_information": "Iron is primarily absorbed in the duodenum, which is the first part of the small intestine. The consensus indicates that approximately 90% of iron absorption occurs here, making it the major site for this process. While there is some absorption in the jejunum, it is significantly less, and the ileum is not a primary site for iron absorption. The stomach has minimal absorption of iron, confirming that it is not a primary site. Therefore, the most accurate option is 'Duodenum' (opb), as it aligns with the established physiological understanding of iron absorption.",
  "analysis": "Iron absorption primarily occurs in the duodenum, which is the first section of the small intestine. The consensus in medical literature indicates that about 90% of iron absorption takes place here, making it the most significant site for this process. While there is some absorption in the jejunum, it is considerably less, and the ileum is not recognized as a primary site for iron absorption. The stomach has minimal absorption capabilities for iron. Given this information, the best-supported option is 'Duodenum' (opb), as it aligns with established physiological understanding.",
