  "enhanced_information": "Dextromethorphan is known to act as an NMDA receptor antagonist, which can lead to altered neurotransmission and is associated with hallucinations, particularly at high doses. Morphine, an opioid, can also cause central nervous system effects, including hallucinations, but this is less common and typically occurs at higher doses or in sensitive individuals. Diphenhydramine, an antihistamine with anticholinergic properties, can lead to central nervous system effects, including hallucinations, especially in the elderly or at high doses. Aprepitant, primarily an antiemetic through neurokinin-1 receptor antagonism, is unlikely to cause hallucinations and is not typically associated with such effects. Therefore, the antitussives most likely to lead to hallucinations are Dextromethorphan and Diphenhydramine.",
  "analysis": "Dextromethorphan is well-documented to cause hallucinations, particularly at high doses, due to its action as an NMDA receptor antagonist. Morphine can also lead to hallucinations, but this is less common and usually occurs at higher doses or in sensitive individuals. Diphenhydramine, an antihistamine, can cause hallucinations, especially in the elderly or at high doses, but it is not primarily used as an antitussive. Aprepitant is not associated with hallucinations. Given the context of antitussives, Dextromethorphan is the most recognized for this side effect. Therefore, while both Dextromethorphan and Diphenhydramine can lead to hallucinations, Dextromethorphan is the primary antitussive known for this effect. Thus, the best-supported option is Dextromethorphan.",
