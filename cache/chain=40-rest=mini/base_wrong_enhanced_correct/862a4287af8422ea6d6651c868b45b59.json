  "enhanced_information": "Schizophrenia is primarily treated with antipsychotics, which target dopamine dysregulation and are effective in reducing positive symptoms such as hallucinations and delusions. The reasoning chains confirm that antipsychotics are the mainstay of treatment, with a high consensus on their efficacy (95% for dopamine receptor antagonism and symptom control). While antidepressants may be used for comorbid depression, they are not the primary treatment for schizophrenia (60%). Antiepileptics and mood stabilizers are not standard treatments for schizophrenia, although they may have some role in managing mood symptoms or comorbid conditions (50% and 55% respectively). Evidence paths support the association of antipsychotic agents with the physiological aspects of schizophrenia, reinforcing their primary role in treatment.",
  "analysis": "Schizophrenia is primarily treated with antipsychotic medications, which are designed to address the core symptoms of the disorder, particularly the positive symptoms such as hallucinations and delusions. The enhanced information confirms that antipsychotics are the mainstay of treatment, with a high consensus on their efficacy in managing these symptoms. While antidepressants may be used for patients with comorbid depression, they do not serve as the primary treatment for schizophrenia. Antiepileptics and mood stabilizers are not standard treatments for schizophrenia, although they may be considered in specific cases involving mood symptoms or comorbid conditions. Given this information, the best-supported option is clearly antipsychotics.",
