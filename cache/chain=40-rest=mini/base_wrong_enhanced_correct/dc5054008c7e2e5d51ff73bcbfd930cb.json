  "enhanced_information": "Imipramine is a tricyclic antidepressant known for its anticholinergic effects, which can reduce bladder contractions and subsequently decrease nocturnal enuresis. This aligns with clinical consensus that supports the use of imipramine in treating bedwetting. In contrast, fluvoxamine (an SSRI), phenelzine (an MAOI), and bupropion (an NDRI) do not have direct effects on bladder function and are unlikely to be effective for nocturnal enuresis. Therefore, imipramine is the most appropriate choice for this condition.",
  "analysis": "Nocturnal enuresis, or bedwetting, can be treated with various medications, but tricyclic antidepressants like imipramine have been shown to be effective due to their anticholinergic properties, which help reduce bladder contractions. The other options—fluvoxamine, phenelzine, and bupropion—do not have established efficacy for this condition. Therefore, based on the consensus in clinical practice, imipramine is the most appropriate choice for treating nocturnal enuresis.",
