  "enhanced_information": "Atropine is a muscarinic receptor antagonist that primarily blocks the effects of acetylcholine at muscarinic receptors, particularly in the heart, where it can prevent bradycardia. Therefore, it effectively blocks bradycardia caused by acetylcholine infusion (option c). However, atropine does not affect nicotinic receptors, which means it has no impact on the increased blood pressure caused by nicotine (option a) or the increased skeletal muscle strength caused by neostigmine, an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor (option b). Thus, the correct answer is that atropine can block bradycardia caused by acetylcholine but does not block the effects of nicotine or neostigmine. Therefore, the best answer is option c only.",
  "analysis": "Atropine is a muscarinic receptor antagonist that blocks the effects of acetylcholine at muscarinic receptors. It is well-established that atropine can effectively block bradycardia caused by acetylcholine infusion (option c). However, it does not affect nicotinic receptors, which means it cannot block the increased blood pressure caused by nicotine (option a) or the increased skeletal muscle strength caused by neostigmine (option b). Therefore, the only effect that can be blocked by atropine among the options provided is the bradycardia caused by acetylcholine. Thus, the best-supported answer is option c only, as options a and b are not affected by atropine. The reasoning aligns with pharmacological principles regarding the specificity of atropine's action on muscarinic versus nicotinic receptors.",
