  "enhanced_information": "Disaccharides, such as sucrose and lactose, undergo significant digestion primarily in the small intestine. Enzymes like sucrase and lactase are secreted in the intestinal lining, breaking down disaccharides into monosaccharides, which are then absorbed into the bloodstream. While disaccharides enter the mouth and stomach, there is no significant digestion occurring in these areas due to the lack of specific enzymes. The large intestine may see some fermentation of undigested disaccharides by gut bacteria, but this is not the primary site for their digestion. Therefore, the correct answer is that digestion of disaccharides occurs at the small intestine.",
  "analysis": "Disaccharides, such as sucrose and lactose, are primarily digested in the small intestine. This is where specific enzymes like sucrase and lactase are secreted, facilitating the breakdown of disaccharides into monosaccharides for absorption. While disaccharides can enter the mouth and stomach, no significant enzymatic digestion occurs there. The large intestine may see some fermentation of undigested disaccharides, but this is not the primary site for their digestion. Therefore, the consensus in physiology is that the digestion of disaccharides occurs in the small intestine.",
