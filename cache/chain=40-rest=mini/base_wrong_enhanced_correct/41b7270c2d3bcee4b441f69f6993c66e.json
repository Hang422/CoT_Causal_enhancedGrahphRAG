  "enhanced_information": "Gp2b3A inhibitors are a class of antiplatelet agents that block the glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor on platelets, preventing aggregation. The options include: 1) Abciximab, which is a Gp2b3A inhibitor; 2) Eptifibatide, also a Gp2b3A inhibitor; 3) Tirofiban, another Gp2b3A inhibitor; and 4) Prasugrel, which is an antiplatelet agent but not a Gp2b3A inhibitor. Therefore, the correct answer is Prasugrel, as it does not belong to the Gp2b3A inhibitor class.",
  "analysis": "Gp2b3A inhibitors are a specific class of antiplatelet medications that target the glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor on platelets, effectively preventing platelet aggregation. The options provided include: 1) Abciximab, which is a well-known Gp2b3A inhibitor; 2) Eptifibatide, another recognized Gp2b3A inhibitor; 3) Tirofiban, also classified as a Gp2b3A inhibitor; and 4) Prasugrel, which is an antiplatelet agent but does not act on the Gp2b3A receptor. Therefore, the only option that does not belong to the Gp2b3A inhibitor class is Prasugrel. This conclusion is supported by established pharmacological knowledge regarding these medications. Hence, the correct answer is Prasugrel.",
