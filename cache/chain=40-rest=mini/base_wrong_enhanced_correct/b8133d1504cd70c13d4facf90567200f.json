  "enhanced_information": "Cardiac muscle is characterized by several key features: it is striated, similar to skeletal muscle, which confirms option (a) as correct. Cardiac muscle has large T tubules that facilitate efficient calcium handling, supporting option (b) as correct. The presence of a troponin system in cardiac muscle is crucial for the regulation of contraction, making option (c) correct as well. However, option (d) is incorrect; caldesmon is not a significant regulatory protein in cardiac muscle, as cardiac muscle contraction is primarily regulated by the troponin-tropomyosin complex, not caldesmon. Therefore, the correct answer to the question is option (d).",
  "analysis": "Cardiac muscle has several defining characteristics. It is striated, which is similar to skeletal muscle, confirming option (a) as correct. Cardiac muscle also features large T tubules that play a crucial role in calcium handling, supporting option (b) as correct. The presence of a troponin system is essential for the regulation of contraction in cardiac muscle, making option (c) correct as well. However, caldesmon is not a significant regulatory protein in cardiac muscle; instead, cardiac muscle contraction is primarily regulated by the troponin-tropomyosin complex. Therefore, option (d) is the only statement that does not accurately describe a feature of cardiac muscle. Thus, the correct answer is option (d).",
