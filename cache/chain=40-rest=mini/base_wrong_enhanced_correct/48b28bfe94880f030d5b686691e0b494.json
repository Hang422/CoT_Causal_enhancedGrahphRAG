  "enhanced_information": "Spironolactone is known for its anti-androgenic effects, which can lead to gynecomastia, making it the most likely medication prescribed in this case. Hydrochlorothiazide has a potential link to hormonal imbalances, but the association with gynecomastia is less direct and less common. Captopril and Furosemide have no established links to gynecomastia, making them unlikely causes. Therefore, the most probable medication prescribed for this patient, given the substantial increase in breast size, is Spironolactone.",
  "analysis": "The patient presents with gynecomastia, which is an increase in breast tissue in males. Among the listed antihypertensive medications, Spironolactone is known for its anti-androgenic properties, which can lead to hormonal imbalances resulting in gynecomastia. Captopril (an ACE inhibitor) and Furosemide (a loop diuretic) do not have a significant association with gynecomastia. Hydrochlorothiazide (a thiazide diuretic) has some hormonal effects but is less commonly linked to gynecomastia compared to Spironolactone. Given the clear association of Spironolactone with gynecomastia, it is the most likely medication prescribed to this patient. Therefore, the best-supported option is Spironolactone.",
