  "enhanced_information": "5'-nucleotidase, Adenylyl cyclase, and Na+-K+-ATPase are all enzymatic markers localized to the plasma membrane, confirming their roles as plasma membrane markers. In contrast, Galactosyl transferase is primarily localized to the Golgi apparatus and is not considered a marker for the plasma membrane. Therefore, the correct answer is Galactosyl transferase, as it does not serve as a plasma membrane marker.",
  "analysis": "In evaluating the enzymatic markers of the plasma membrane, we consider the localization and function of each enzyme listed. 5'-nucleotidase, Adenylyl cyclase, and Na+-K+-ATPase are all well-established as being associated with the plasma membrane, playing critical roles in various physiological processes. In contrast, Galactosyl transferase is primarily found in the Golgi apparatus, where it is involved in glycosylation processes, and is not a marker for the plasma membrane. Therefore, based on the consensus in the literature regarding the localization of these enzymes, Galactosyl transferase is the only option that does not belong to the category of plasma membrane markers. This leads to the conclusion that the correct answer is Galactosyl transferase.",
