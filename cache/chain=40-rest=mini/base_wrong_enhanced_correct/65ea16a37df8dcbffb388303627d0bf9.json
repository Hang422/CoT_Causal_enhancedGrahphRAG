  "enhanced_information": "Nyctalopia, or night blindness, is primarily caused by a deficiency in Vitamin A, which is essential for the synthesis of rhodopsin, a visual pigment in rod cells that is crucial for low-light vision. The reasoning chains consistently point to Vitamin A deficiency as the primary cause, with high confidence levels (90-95%). Evidence paths support this by linking malnutrition and night blindness directly to Vitamin A deficiency. Other vitamins (B, C, E) are not associated with nyctalopia, confirming that the correct answer is Vitamin A.",
  "analysis": "Nyctalopia, or night blindness, is primarily linked to a deficiency in Vitamin A. This vitamin is crucial for the production of rhodopsin, a pigment found in the rod cells of the retina that is essential for vision in low-light conditions. The consensus in medical literature strongly supports that Vitamin A deficiency leads to impaired night vision, while deficiencies in Vitamins B, C, and E do not have a direct association with nyctalopia. Therefore, based on established medical knowledge and the enhanced information provided, the most likely correct answer is Vitamin A.",
