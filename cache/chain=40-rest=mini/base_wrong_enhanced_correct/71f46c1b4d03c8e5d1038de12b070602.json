  "enhanced_information": "Isoniazid is known to interfere with the metabolism of pyridoxine (Vitamin B6), leading to a deficiency. The consensus in pharmacology indicates that isoniazid can act as a pyridoxine antagonist and increase the excretion of pyridoxine, which supports the reasoning that Vitamin B6 deficiency is more likely in patients taking isoniazid. The evidence paths confirm that isoniazid's action is associated with the uptake and metabolism of pyridoxine, further supporting the conclusion that Vitamin B6 deficiency is the most relevant concern in this context.",
  "analysis": "Isoniazid is known to interfere with the metabolism of Vitamin B6 (pyridoxine), leading to a deficiency. This is well-documented in pharmacology, as isoniazid acts as a pyridoxine antagonist and increases the excretion of pyridoxine. While other vitamin deficiencies can occur in various contexts, the specific interaction between isoniazid and Vitamin B6 is the most significant and clinically relevant. Therefore, the most likely vitamin deficiency seen in patients on isoniazid is Vitamin B6.",
