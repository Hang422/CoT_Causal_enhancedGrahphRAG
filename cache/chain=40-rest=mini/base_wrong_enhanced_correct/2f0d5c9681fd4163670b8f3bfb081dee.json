  "enhanced_information": "Opioids are known for several pharmacological actions. Cough suppression is a recognized effect of opioids, as they can act on the cough center in the brain. Miosis, or pupil constriction, is a classic effect of opioid use due to their action on the central nervous system. Truncal rigidity, characterized by muscle stiffness, can occur with high doses of opioids, particularly during anesthesia. However, anti-emesis is not a common action of opioids; while some opioids can cause nausea, they are not typically used to prevent vomiting. Therefore, the option that is NOT a pharmacological action of opioids is anti-emesis.",
  "analysis": "Opioids are known for several pharmacological actions, including cough suppression (opa), miosis (opc), and truncal rigidity (opd). Cough suppression occurs as opioids act on the cough center in the brain, while miosis is a classic effect due to their action on the central nervous system. Truncal rigidity can occur, especially at higher doses or during anesthesia. However, anti-emesis (opb) is not a recognized pharmacological action of opioids; in fact, opioids are more commonly associated with causing nausea and vomiting rather than preventing it. Therefore, the option that is NOT a pharmacological action of opioids is anti-emesis.",
