  "enhanced_information": "The placenta secretes Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG), which is the hormone utilized in the early detection of pregnancy. hCG is produced shortly after the embryo implants in the uterine lining and can be detected in both urine and blood, making it a reliable marker for pregnancy tests. The reasoning chains correctly highlight that hCG is associated with early pregnancy detection, with a high percentage of accuracy in these tests. The retrieved evidence paths support the role of hCG in early diagnosis, confirming its significance in pregnancy detection. Other options, such as Endothelial Growth Factor (EGF), Human Chorionic Somatotropin (HCS), and Relaxin, do not play a role in early pregnancy detection and are therefore not relevant to the question.",
  "analysis": "The placenta secretes several hormones during pregnancy, but the one specifically utilized for early detection of pregnancy is Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG). This hormone is produced shortly after the embryo implants in the uterine lining and is the primary marker used in both urine and blood tests for pregnancy. Other options, such as Endothelial Growth Factor (EGF), Human Chorionic Somatotropin (HCS), and Relaxin, do not serve this purpose in early pregnancy detection. Therefore, based on established medical knowledge and the enhanced information provided, the most accurate answer is hCG.",
