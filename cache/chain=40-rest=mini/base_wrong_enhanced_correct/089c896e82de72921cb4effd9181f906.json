  "enhanced_information": "Gastrin is a hormone secreted by G cells in the gastric mucosa, not by parietal cells or alpha cells of the pancreas. It is primarily stimulated by the presence of peptides in the stomach, which leads to increased gastric acid secretion. Elevated gastrin levels can indicate conditions such as Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. Importantly, gastrin does not decrease bicarbonate content in pancreatic secretions; rather, it promotes gastric acid secretion. Therefore, the correct statement regarding gastrin is that it is stimulated by endoluminal peptides in the stomach.",
  "analysis": "Gastrin is a hormone produced by G cells in the gastric mucosa, not by parietal cells or alpha cells of the pancreas. It is primarily stimulated by the presence of peptides in the stomach, which aligns with the statement that gastrin gets stimulated by endoluminal peptides in the stomach. The other options are incorrect: parietal cells secrete hydrochloric acid, not gastrin; alpha cells of the pancreas secrete glucagon, not gastrin; and gastrin does not decrease bicarbonate content in pancreatic secretions but rather promotes gastric acid secretion. Therefore, the most accurate statement regarding gastrin is that it is stimulated by endoluminal peptides in the stomach.",
