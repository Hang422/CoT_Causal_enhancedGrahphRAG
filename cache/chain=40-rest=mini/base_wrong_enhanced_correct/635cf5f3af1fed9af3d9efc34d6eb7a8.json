  "enhanced_information": "The drug implicated in causing deafness and tinnitus in a patient on anti-tubercular therapy is Streptomycin. This drug is known for its ototoxicity, which can lead to hearing loss and tinnitus. The reasoning chain for Streptomycin is supported by the evidence that it treats tuberculosis and is associated with ototoxic effects. In contrast, Isoniazid primarily causes peripheral neuropathy with no clear link to deafness, Ethambutol is associated with optic neuritis and visual disturbances, and Rifampicin is linked to hepatotoxicity without a direct connection to hearing issues. Therefore, the most likely cause of the symptoms described is Streptomycin.",
  "analysis": "In the context of anti-tubercular therapy, the patient is experiencing deafness and tinnitus, which are symptoms commonly associated with ototoxicity. Among the listed drugs, Streptomycin is well-documented to cause ototoxic effects, leading to hearing loss and tinnitus. Isoniazid is primarily associated with peripheral neuropathy, Ethambutol is known for causing optic neuritis, and Rifampicin is linked to hepatotoxicity. Therefore, the most likely drug implicated in the patient's symptoms is Streptomycin, as it is the only one among the options that is known to cause the specific auditory side effects described. This conclusion is supported by established pharmacological knowledge regarding the side effects of these medications.",
