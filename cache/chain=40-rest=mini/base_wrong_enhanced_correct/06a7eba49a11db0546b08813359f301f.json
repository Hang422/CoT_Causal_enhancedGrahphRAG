  "enhanced_information": "Arachidonic acid is an unsaturated fatty acid that increases membrane fluidity due to its ability to disrupt the packing of lipid molecules in the plasma membrane. Cholesterol, while it can stabilize membranes, generally decreases fluidity at high concentrations, contradicting the initial reasoning. Palmitic acid and stearic acid are saturated fatty acids, which increase membrane rigidity and decrease fluidity. Therefore, the correct answer is that the fluidity of the plasma membrane is increased by arachidonic acid.",
  "analysis": "The fluidity of the plasma membrane is influenced by the composition of its lipid bilayer. Arachidonic acid is an unsaturated fatty acid, which introduces kinks in the fatty acid chains, preventing tight packing and thereby increasing membrane fluidity. In contrast, cholesterol can have a dual role; at low concentrations, it can increase fluidity, but at higher concentrations, it tends to stabilize the membrane and reduce fluidity. Palmitic acid and stearic acid are saturated fatty acids, which promote tighter packing of lipids, leading to decreased fluidity. Given this understanding, the most supported option for increasing membrane fluidity is indeed arachidonic acid, as it disrupts the packing of lipids effectively. Therefore, the correct answer is arachidonic acid.",
