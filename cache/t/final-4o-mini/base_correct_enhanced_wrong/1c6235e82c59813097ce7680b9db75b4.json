  "enhanced_information": "In patients on lithium therapy, certain antihypertensive medications can increase the risk of lithium toxicity. Clonidine is known to potentially increase lithium levels, making it contraindicated in this context. Diuretics, while they can lead to dehydration and affect lithium clearance, are not strictly contraindicated but should be used with caution. Beta blockers and calcium channel blockers are generally considered safe when used cautiously, as they do not significantly affect lithium levels. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is that Clonidine is contraindicated in a patient on lithium therapy to prevent toxicity.",
  "analysis": "In patients undergoing lithium therapy, it is crucial to monitor for potential drug interactions that could lead to increased lithium levels and toxicity. Clonidine is known to potentially increase lithium levels, which makes it contraindicated in patients on lithium therapy. While diuretics can also affect lithium clearance and should be used with caution, they are not strictly contraindicated. Beta blockers and calcium channel blockers do not significantly impact lithium levels and are generally considered safe. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is that Clonidine is contraindicated in a patient on lithium therapy to prevent toxicity.",
