  "enhanced_information": "Prolactin is primarily involved in lactation and has a role in suppressing ovulation, which can lead to infertility in women during breastfeeding. It inhibits gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), resulting in reduced estrogen and progesterone levels, thereby suppressing the menstrual cycle in lactating women. Contrary to the claim that levels are increased by dopamine, dopamine actually inhibits prolactin secretion, leading to decreased levels. While prolactin does exhibit some growth hormone-like effects, its somatotropic activity is not its primary function. Therefore, the correct statements are that prolactin can cause infertility in women and can suppress the menstrual cycle in lactating women.",
  "analysis": "Prolactin is primarily known for its role in lactation and has significant effects on the reproductive system. It can indeed lead to infertility in women, particularly during breastfeeding, due to its ability to suppress gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) and subsequently lower estrogen and progesterone levels. This suppression of hormonal activity can also result in the cessation of the menstrual cycle in lactating women. On the other hand, dopamine is known to inhibit prolactin secretion, meaning that increased levels of prolactin are not caused by dopamine. While prolactin does have some somatotropic activity, it is not its primary function. Therefore, the most accurate statements regarding prolactin are that it can cause infertility in women and can suppress the menstrual cycle in lactating women. Given the options, the best-supported answers are opb and opc, but since the question asks for one option, opc is the most directly related to the menstrual cycle suppression. Thus, the final answer is opc.",
