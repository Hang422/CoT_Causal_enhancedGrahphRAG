  "enhanced_information": "L-Alanine is a known substrate for alkaline phosphatase, indicating it does not act as a non-competitive inhibitor. L-Tyrosine is not widely recognized as an inhibitor of alkaline phosphatase, and its role as a non-competitive inhibitor remains unclear. L-Tryptophan is not typically associated with inhibition of alkaline phosphatase, and while it may have some inhibitory effects, this is not well established. L-Phenylalanine has been studied for its effects on enzymes and has potential for non-competitive inhibition of alkaline phosphatase, making it the most plausible candidate among the options. Therefore, L-Phenylalanine is the best-supported option as a non-competitive inhibitor of intestinal alkaline phosphatase.",
  "analysis": "In assessing the options for a non-competitive inhibitor of intestinal alkaline phosphatase, we consider the roles of each amino acid. L-Alanine is a substrate for alkaline phosphatase, indicating it does not inhibit the enzyme. L-Tyrosine has not been established as an inhibitor, and its role remains ambiguous. L-Tryptophan is not typically associated with inhibition of alkaline phosphatase, and while it may have some inhibitory effects, these are not well documented. L-Phenylalanine, however, has been studied in the context of enzyme inhibition and has shown potential for non-competitive inhibition of alkaline phosphatase. Given this analysis, L-Phenylalanine is the most plausible candidate for a non-competitive inhibitor among the options provided. Therefore, the best-supported option is L-Phenylalanine.",
