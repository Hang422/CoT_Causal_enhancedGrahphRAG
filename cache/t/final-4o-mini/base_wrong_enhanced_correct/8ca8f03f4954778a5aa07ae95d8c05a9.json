  "enhanced_information": "Sickle cell disease is caused by a single nucleotide mutation that results in the substitution of Glutamic acid (a polar amino acid) with Valine (a non-polar amino acid). This change creates a 'sticky patch' on the hemoglobin molecule, which is crucial for the disease's pathology. Therefore, the statement about the 'sticky patch' being generated from a non-polar to polar residue change is incorrect, as it is actually a polar to non-polar change. Additionally, heterozygotes for sickle cell disease (carrying both HbA and HbS) do indeed have a selective advantage against malaria, confirming that HbS confers resistance in these individuals. The option regarding RFLP is accurate as it results from a single base change. Thus, the only incorrect statement is the one regarding the 'sticky patch' generation.",
  "analysis": "Sickle cell disease is primarily caused by a single nucleotide mutation that leads to the substitution of Glutamic acid (a polar amino acid) with Valine (a non-polar amino acid) in the hemoglobin beta chain. This mutation creates a 'sticky patch' on the hemoglobin molecule, which is critical for the disease's pathology. The statement regarding the 'sticky patch' incorrectly describes the nature of the amino acid change, stating it is from a non-polar to a polar residue, which is not accurate. The other statements regarding RFLP resulting from a single base change and the resistance to malaria in heterozygotes are correct. Therefore, the only incorrect statement is the one about the 'sticky patch'.",
