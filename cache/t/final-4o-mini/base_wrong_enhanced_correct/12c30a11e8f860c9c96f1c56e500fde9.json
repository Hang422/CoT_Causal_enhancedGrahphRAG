  "enhanced_information": "Glycogen storage diseases (GSDs) are a group of inherited metabolic disorders characterized by enzyme deficiencies that lead to abnormal glycogen metabolism. They include conditions such as Pompe disease and McArdle disease. Krabbe's disease is a lysosomal storage disorder caused by a deficiency in the enzyme galactocerebrosidase, and it is not classified as a glycogen storage disease. Similarly, Fabry's disease is a sphingolipidosis, which also does not involve glycogen metabolism. Fragile X syndrome is a genetic condition associated with intellectual disability and is unrelated to glycogen storage. Therefore, all three options (Krabbe's disease, Fabry's disease, and Fragile X syndrome) do not belong to the category of glycogen storage diseases, confirming that the correct answer is 'All'.",
  "analysis": "Glycogen storage diseases (GSDs) are specifically related to enzyme deficiencies that affect glycogen metabolism. The options provided include Krabbe's disease, Fabry's disease, and Fragile X syndrome. Krabbe's disease is a lysosomal storage disorder, Fabry's disease is a sphingolipidosis, and Fragile X syndrome is a genetic condition associated with intellectual disability. None of these conditions are classified as glycogen storage diseases. Therefore, the correct answer is that all the listed diseases do not belong to the category of glycogen storage diseases, confirming that the answer is 'All'. This conclusion is supported by the definitions and classifications of these diseases in medical literature.",
