  "enhanced_information": "The therapeutic blood range of theophylline is widely accepted to be between 10-20 micrograms per liter (µg/L). Specifically, levels of 10-15 µg/L are often considered subtherapeutic, while levels of 15-20 µg/L are deemed therapeutic. This aligns with the understanding that theophylline has a narrow therapeutic index, necessitating careful monitoring to ensure efficacy and avoid toxicity. Therefore, the correct therapeutic range is best represented by the options indicating 10-20 µg/L, with 15-20 µg/L being optimal for therapeutic effect.",
  "analysis": "The therapeutic blood range of theophylline is well-established in pharmacology. The consensus indicates that the therapeutic range is typically between 10-20 micrograms per liter (µg/L). Within this range, levels of 10-15 µg/L are often considered subtherapeutic, while levels of 15-20 µg/L are regarded as therapeutic. Given the options provided, the best representation of the therapeutic range is option 'opb' (10-May) and option 'opc' (15-May), but since 'May' is likely a typographical error for '20', the most accurate option reflecting the therapeutic range is 'opd' (20-May). Therefore, the most appropriate choice is option 'opd', as it encompasses the upper limit of the therapeutic range. The reasoning is based on the established pharmacological guidelines regarding theophylline levels and their clinical implications.",
