  "enhanced_information": "In severe renal failure, the safety of antitubercular drugs varies significantly based on their pharmacokinetics. Streptomycin is primarily excreted by the kidneys, leading to potential accumulation and toxicity, making it unsafe in severe renal failure. Ethambutol is partially excreted by the kidneys and requires dose adjustment; it can be used with caution in renal failure. Capreomycin is also excreted by the kidneys and poses a risk of nephrotoxicity, thus it is not recommended in severe renal failure. Rifampicin, however, is mainly metabolized by the liver with minimal renal excretion, making it generally safe for use in patients with renal failure. Therefore, the best option for use in severe renal failure is Rifampicin.",
  "analysis": "In severe renal failure, the pharmacokinetics of antitubercular drugs are crucial for determining their safety. Streptomycin and Capreomycin are both primarily excreted by the kidneys, which increases the risk of accumulation and toxicity in patients with renal impairment. Ethambutol is partially excreted by the kidneys and requires dose adjustments, making it usable with caution but not ideal. Rifampicin, on the other hand, is predominantly metabolized by the liver, with minimal renal excretion, which makes it generally safe for use in patients with severe renal failure. Therefore, based on the pharmacokinetic profiles and the consensus in medical literature, Rifampicin is the best option for use in severe renal failure.",
