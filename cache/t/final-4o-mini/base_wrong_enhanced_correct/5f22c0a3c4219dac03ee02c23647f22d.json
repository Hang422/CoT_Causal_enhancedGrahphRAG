  "enhanced_information": "Glutathione is a tripeptide that primarily functions as an antioxidant, playing a crucial role in reducing oxidative stress and supporting various physiological processes. While it is involved in detoxification and can influence enzyme activity, it does not directly help in the absorption of amino acids. The consensus indicates that glutathione does not inactivate enzymes in a general sense but may modulate their activity in specific contexts. Additionally, it does play a role in membrane transport mechanisms, facilitating nutrient uptake. Therefore, while options b and c have some validity, option a is misleading. The most accurate conclusion is that not all options are true, and thus the correct answer is that only specific roles of glutathione are supported by consensus.",
  "analysis": "Glutathione is primarily known for its role as an antioxidant and in detoxification processes. It does not directly aid in the absorption of certain amino acids (option a), which is misleading. While glutathione can influence enzyme activity, it does not generally inactivate enzymes (option b); rather, it may modulate their activity in specific contexts. However, it does play a role in membrane transport mechanisms (option c), facilitating the uptake of nutrients. Given this analysis, options a and b are not true, while option c is valid. Therefore, the correct conclusion is that not all options are true, and the best-supported option is option c alone. Thus, the answer is not 'All' (option d).",
