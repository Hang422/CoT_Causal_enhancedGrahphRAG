  "enhanced_information": "Pilocarpine reduces intraocular pressure in closed angle glaucoma primarily by increasing aqueous humour outflow. It achieves this by stimulating muscarinic receptors, which causes contraction of the iris sphincter muscle and ciliary muscle. This contraction leads to miosis (pupil constriction), which reduces pupillary block and facilitates drainage through the trabecular meshwork. While there may be some reduction in aqueous humour secretion, the primary mechanism is the enhancement of outflow. The evidence supports that pilocarpine's action on the ciliary muscle and trabecular meshwork is crucial for its therapeutic effect in lowering intraocular pressure.",
  "analysis": "Pilocarpine is a muscarinic agonist that primarily reduces intraocular pressure in closed angle glaucoma by increasing aqueous humour outflow. It does this by stimulating the contraction of the iris sphincter muscle and the ciliary muscle, leading to miosis and improved drainage through the trabecular meshwork. While it may have some effect on reducing aqueous humour secretion, the predominant mechanism is the enhancement of outflow. Therefore, the best-supported option is 'opc. Increasing aqueous humour outflow.'",
