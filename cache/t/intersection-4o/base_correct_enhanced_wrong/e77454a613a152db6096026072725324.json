  "enhanced_information": "Beta blockers are contraindicated in bronchial asthma due to their potential to cause bronchoconstriction, which can exacerbate asthma symptoms. This is supported by the evidence path indicating that adrenergic beta-antagonists can cause asthma. In decompensated heart failure, beta blockers can reduce cardiac output, worsening the condition, which aligns with standard medical consensus. However, the link between beta blockers and variant angina is less clear; while beta blockers are generally not first-line treatment for variant angina due to the risk of coronary vasospasm, they are not universally contraindicated. Therefore, the most consensus-aligned contraindications for beta blockers are bronchial asthma and decompensated heart failure, making option 'd. All the above' incorrect.",
  "analysis": "Beta blockers are contraindicated in bronchial asthma because they can cause bronchoconstriction, worsening asthma symptoms. In decompensated heart failure, beta blockers can further reduce cardiac output, exacerbating the condition. While beta blockers are not the first choice for variant angina due to the risk of coronary vasospasm, they are not universally contraindicated. Therefore, the most consensus-aligned contraindications are bronchial asthma and decompensated heart failure. Given this, the option 'd. All the above' is incorrect because variant angina is not a strict contraindication.",
