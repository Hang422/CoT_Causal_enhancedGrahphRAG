  "enhanced_information": "In the context of enzyme inhibition, a non-competitive inhibitor binds to an enzyme at a site other than the active site, reducing the enzyme's activity without competing with the substrate. Among the options, L-Tryptophan is known to act as a non-competitive inhibitor for certain enzymes, including intestinal alkaline phosphatase, as it can bind to sites other than the active site, altering enzyme function. The evidence path indicating Tryptophan's interaction with enzymes supports this mechanism. The other amino acids, L-Alanine, L-Tyrosine, and L-Phenylalanine, do not have strong evidence or consensus supporting their role as non-competitive inhibitors of intestinal alkaline phosphatase. Therefore, L-Tryptophan is the most likely non-competitive inhibitor among the given options.",
  "analysis": "In the context of enzyme inhibition, a non-competitive inhibitor binds to an enzyme at a site other than the active site, which reduces the enzyme's activity without directly competing with the substrate. Among the given options, L-Tryptophan is noted in the enhanced information as having evidence supporting its role as a non-competitive inhibitor for certain enzymes, including intestinal alkaline phosphatase. This aligns with the general understanding that non-competitive inhibitors can bind to allosteric sites, altering enzyme function. The other amino acids listed (L-Alanine, L-Tyrosine, and L-Phenylalanine) do not have strong evidence or consensus supporting their role as non-competitive inhibitors of intestinal alkaline phosphatase. Therefore, based on the available information and the enhanced context provided, L-Tryptophan is the most likely non-competitive inhibitor among the given options.",
