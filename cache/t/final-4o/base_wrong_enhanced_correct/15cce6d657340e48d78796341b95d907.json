  "enhanced_information": "The tonic neck reflex is primarily mediated by the brainstem, particularly involving the medulla oblongata. A lesion in the medulla can lead to the loss of this reflex, as it is a critical part of the brainstem involved in reflexive actions. The evidence path confirms that the medulla is part of the brainstem, supporting the reasoning that a lesion here would affect the reflex. While the spinal cord is involved in many reflex pathways, the tonic neck reflex is more specifically associated with the brainstem, making a spinal cord lesion less likely to result in its loss. The midbrain and cerebral cortex are less directly involved in this reflex, with lesions in these areas being less likely to cause its loss. Therefore, the most consensus-aligned conclusion is that a lesion in the medulla is most likely to result in the loss of the tonic neck reflex.",
  "analysis": "The tonic neck reflex, also known as the asymmetric tonic neck reflex, is primarily mediated by the brainstem. The medulla oblongata, a part of the brainstem, plays a significant role in reflexive actions. While the spinal cord is involved in many reflex pathways, the tonic neck reflex is more specifically associated with the brainstem. Lesions in the cerebral cortex or midbrain are less likely to directly affect this reflex. Therefore, based on standard medical knowledge and the enhanced information provided, a lesion in the medulla is most likely to result in the loss of the tonic neck reflex.",
