  "enhanced_information": "In evaluating insulin resistance in diabetic patients, the following insights are aligned with medical consensus: (opb) Infections can lead to an inflammatory response, which is known to increase insulin resistance, supported by the evidence path linking inflammation to insulin resistance. (opc) The presence of antibodies to insulin can bind to insulin, reducing its effectiveness and contributing to insulin resistance. (opd) Glucocorticoids are known to increase blood glucose levels and can worsen insulin resistance, making their use counterproductive in managing insulin resistance. However, (opa) 'Huminsulin,' a common type of insulin, does not inherently lead to increased insulin resistance compared to other insulin types. Therefore, the statement that insulin resistance is more common with huminsulin is incorrect.",
  "analysis": "To determine which statement is incorrect regarding insulin resistance in diabetic patients, we evaluate each option based on standard medical knowledge and enhanced information. Option (opb) is correct because infections can increase insulin resistance due to the inflammatory response. Option (opc) is also correct, as antibodies to insulin can indeed cause insulin resistance by binding to insulin and reducing its effectiveness. Option (opd) is incorrect because glucocorticoids are known to increase blood glucose levels and worsen insulin resistance, not improve it. Therefore, their use is not beneficial in managing insulin resistance. Option (opa) is the statement that is incorrect, as 'Huminsulin' does not inherently lead to increased insulin resistance compared to other types of insulin. Thus, the statement that insulin resistance is more common with huminsulin is not supported by medical consensus.",
