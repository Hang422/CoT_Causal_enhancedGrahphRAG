  "enhanced_information": "Tacrolimus is not a macrolide antibiotic; it is an immunosuppressant, which makes option 'opa' incorrect. It should not be safely administered with nephrotoxic drugs due to the increased risk of nephrotoxicity, confirming option 'opb' as incorrect. Glucose intolerance is a well-known side effect of Tacrolimus, supported by evidence paths showing its association with impaired glucose tolerance, validating option 'opc'. Tacrolimus is commonly used as prophylaxis for transplant rejection, aligning with standard medical use, confirming option 'opd' as correct. Therefore, the incorrect statement about Tacrolimus is option 'opa'.",
  "analysis": "Tacrolimus is primarily known as an immunosuppressant used to prevent organ transplant rejection, not as a macrolide antibiotic, which makes option 'opa' incorrect. It is important to note that Tacrolimus should be used cautiously with nephrotoxic drugs due to its own nephrotoxic potential, making option 'opb' incorrect as well. Glucose intolerance is a recognized side effect of Tacrolimus, supporting the correctness of option 'opc'. Finally, Tacrolimus is indeed used for prophylaxis in transplant rejection, confirming option 'opd' as correct. Therefore, the statement that is most clearly incorrect based on standard medical knowledge is option 'opa'.",
