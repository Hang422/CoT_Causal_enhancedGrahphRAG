It can also decrease the risk of endometrial hyperplasia due to its estrogen receptor antagonist activity. While it may increase triglyceride levels, leading to a possible increase in cardiovascular risk factors, the direct effect on decreasing triglyceride levels is less likely. Additionally, Tamoxifen may reduce the risk of ovarian cancer in certain populations.",
