  "enhanced_information": "Metoprolol is preferred over Propranolol as it is more selective in blocking beta-1 receptors, making it a better choice for cardiac conditions. Additionally, Metoprolol is less likely to cause bronchoconstriction, making it safer for patients with asthma. It is also associated with fewer central nervous system side effects, making it preferable for essential tremors. Moreover, Metoprolol is less likely to impair exercise capacity compared to Propranolol.",
