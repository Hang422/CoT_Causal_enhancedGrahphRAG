  "enhanced_information": "Podophyllin is effective for treating plantar warts through local application. It is also used topically for genital warts and targets HPV-infected cells in verruca warts. Therefore, local application of podophyllin is suitable for treating plantar warts, genital warts, and verruca warts.",
  "analysis": "Podophyllin is known to be effective for treating plantar warts, genital warts, and verruca warts through local application. While it is primarily used for genital warts, it is also suitable for plantar warts and verruca warts. Therefore, the correct answer is that all of the above types of warts can be treated by local application of podophyllin.",
