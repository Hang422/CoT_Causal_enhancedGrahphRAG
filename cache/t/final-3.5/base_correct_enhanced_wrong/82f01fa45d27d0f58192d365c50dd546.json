  "enhanced_information": "Ergometrine is not used for the initiation of labor due to its potential to cause fetal distress, not because of its onset of action, fetal hypoxia, or acting on D2 receptors to cause vomiting. Additionally, ergometrine can lead to vasoconstriction and increased blood pressure, which further supports its avoidance in labor induction.",
  "analysis": "Ergometrine is avoided for the initiation of labor due to its potential to cause fetal distress and increase blood pressure, not because of its onset of action, fetal hypoxia, or acting on D2 receptors to cause vomiting. The vasoconstrictive effects and the risk of fetal distress make it unsuitable for labor induction.",
