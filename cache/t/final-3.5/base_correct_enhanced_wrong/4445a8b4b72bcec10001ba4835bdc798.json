Quinine is unlikely to cause retinal pigmentation. Atovaquone has no known association with retinal pigmentation. Evidence paths support the potential retinal toxicity of Mefloquine, which aligns with its possible role in causing retinal pigmentation.",

Quinine is unlikely to cause retinal pigmentation. Atovaquone has no known association with retinal pigmentation.
