  "enhanced_information": "The drug of choice for bleeding oesophageal varices is Ethanolamine oleate, which acts as a sclerosing agent inducing thrombosis in varices to stop bleeding. This is supported by the evidence path linking ethanolamine oleate to thrombin and sclerosing agents, confirming its mechanism of action.",
