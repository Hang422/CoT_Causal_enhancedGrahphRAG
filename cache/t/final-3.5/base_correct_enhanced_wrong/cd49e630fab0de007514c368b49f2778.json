  ],
  "enhanced_information": "Calcitonin is used in Paget's disease, hypercalcemia, osteoporosis, and hypophosphatemia. The evidence path confirms its role in decreasing serum calcium levels. Therefore, Calcitonin is not used in Hypervitaminosis D, making it the exception among the given conditions.",
  "analysis": "Calcitonin is primarily used in conditions where it helps decrease serum calcium levels. Hypervitaminosis D leads to elevated calcium levels, so using calcitonin in this condition would not be beneficial. Therefore, the correct answer is that Calcitonin is not used in Hypervitaminosis D.",
