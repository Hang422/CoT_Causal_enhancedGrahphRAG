  "enhanced_information": "Thiabendazole is an effective treatment for scabies as it kills scabies mites. Benzene hexachloride is not recommended due to toxicity concerns. Erythromycin is not suitable for scabies treatment as it is not effective against scabies mites. Piperazine, an anthelmintic used for worm infections, is not recommended for scabies treatment. Evidence paths confirm the ineffectiveness of anthelmintics like piperazine for scabies treatment.",
  "analysis": "The core medical principle for treating scabies is to use medications that are effective against scabies mites. Thiabendazole is known to be effective in killing scabies mites, making it a suitable treatment option. Benzene hexachloride is not recommended due to toxicity concerns. Erythromycin is not effective against scabies mites. Piperazine, an anthelmintic used for worm infections, is not recommended for scabies treatment. Given the information provided, Thiabendazole is the most appropriate treatment option for scabies.",
