  "enhanced_information": "Spironolactone is a potassium-sparing diuretic that can lead to hyperkalemia. The consensus is that drugs that further increase potassium levels should be avoided. Therefore, the drug contraindicated along with spironolactone is Chlorothiazide, as it can also cause hyperkalemia by reducing potassium excretion.",
  "analysis": "Spironolactone is a potassium-sparing diuretic that can lead to hyperkalemia. Drugs that further increase potassium levels should be avoided when taking spironolactone. Chlorothiazide, an example of a thiazide diuretic, can also cause hyperkalemia by reducing potassium excretion. Therefore, the drug contraindicated along with spironolactone is Chlorothiazide.",
