  "enhanced_information": "The WHO recommended regime for the treatment of Brucella infection is Streptomycin with doxycycline. Streptomycin is an aminoglycoside antibiotic effective against Brucella, and doxycycline, a tetracycline antibiotic, inhibits protein synthesis in bacteria, also effective against Brucella. This combination is supported by WHO guidelines.",
  "analysis": "The core medical principle for treating Brucella infection is the combination of Streptomycin, an aminoglycoside antibiotic effective against Brucella, with doxycycline, a tetracycline antibiotic that inhibits protein synthesis in bacteria. This combination is in line with WHO guidelines and is a well-established treatment regimen for Brucella infections.",
