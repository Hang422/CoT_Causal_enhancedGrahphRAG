  "enhanced_information": "For a pregnant female suspected of having a baby with congenital adrenal hyperplasia, the drug of choice for antenatal glucocorticoid therapy to prevent virilization is Betamethasone. This choice is based on the lower risk of maternal complications compared to Dexamethasone, making Betamethasone the preferred option.",
  "analysis": "The core medical principle for antenatal glucocorticoid therapy in a pregnant female suspected of having a baby with congenital adrenal hyperplasia is to prevent virilization. Betamethasone is the drug of choice due to its lower risk of maternal complications compared to Dexamethasone. This aligns with consensus recommendations.",
