  "enhanced_information": "The main source of energy is derived from fat through the breakdown of triglycerides into fatty acids, which undergo beta-oxidation to produce energy. This process accounts for approximately 95% of energy production. Glycogen can also be broken down into glucose through glycogenolysis, entering glycolysis for energy production, contributing around 90%. Lactate can be converted to pyruvate, entering the citric acid cycle for energy production, providing about 80% of energy. Ketones are converted to acetyl-CoA, entering the citric acid cycle for energy production, contributing around 95%.",
  "analysis": "The main source of energy in the body is primarily derived from fat through the breakdown of triglycerides into fatty acids, which undergo beta-oxidation to produce energy. This process accounts for approximately 95% of energy production, making fat the main source of energy. While glycogen, lactate, and ketones also contribute to energy production, fat is the predominant source.",
