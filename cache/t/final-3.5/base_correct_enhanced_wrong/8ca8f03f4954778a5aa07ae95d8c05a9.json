The single nucleotide change resulting in the substitution of Glutamine to Valine, the generation of a 'sticky patch' due to residue replacement, and the association of RFLP with a single base change are all features of Sickle cell disease.",
  "analysis": "Sickle cell disease is caused by a single nucleotide change resulting in the substitution of Glutamine to Valine, generating a 'sticky patch' due to residue replacement, and is associated with RFLP resulting from a single base change. However, the statement that HbS confers resistance against malaria in heterozygotes is not a characteristic of Sickle cell disease but rather a potential benefit of carrying the sickle cell trait.",
