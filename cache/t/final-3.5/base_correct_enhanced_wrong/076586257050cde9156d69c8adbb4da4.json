    "CHAIN: Exposure to blood from an AIDS patient -> potential HIV transmission risk -> CD4 count of 20/microL and viral RNA load > 10^7 copies/ml -> high viral load indicates increased infectivity -> high risk of HIV transmission -> 80%"
  ],
  "enhanced_information": "The nurse should be treated with full doses of zidovudine for 2 weeks. The high viral load of the AIDS patient indicates increased infectivity and a high risk of HIV transmission. Zidovudine is a standard treatment for post-exposure prophylaxis against HIV, and initiating it promptly can reduce the risk of transmission.",
  "analysis": "The core medical principle here is to provide prompt post-exposure prophylaxis against HIV to reduce the risk of transmission. Given the high viral load of the AIDS patient and the potential severity of the exposure, treating the nurse with full doses of zidovudine for 2 weeks is the most appropriate course of action.",
