  "enhanced_information": "Isoenzymes with the same enzyme classification have the same quaternary structure and distribution in different organs. This is supported by the evidence that enzymes are located in specific organs. However, isoenzymes with the same classification may catalyze different reactions, so the statement that they catalyze the same reaction is not always true.",

While they may have the same numbers in their classification, they may not necessarily catalyze the same reaction. Therefore, the statement that they catalyze the same reaction is not always true.",
