  "question": "A 54-year-old man is brought to the emergency after experiencing several syncopal episodes. The patient states that he is currently taking erythromycin for treatment of bronchitis and another medication for treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). If an electrocardiogram reveals torsades de pointes, the patient is most likely taking which of the following medications for treatment of his reflux disease?",

  ],
  "enhanced_information": "The patient is likely taking Metoclopramide for treatment of his reflux disease, as it is a prokinetic agent commonly associated with torsades de pointes on ECG. This is supported by the fact that Metoclopramide is known to prolong the QT interval, predisposing to torsades de pointes, especially when combined with erythromycin which inhibits CYP3A4.",
  "analysis": "Metoclopramide is a known prokinetic agent that can prolong the QT interval and predispose to torsades de pointes. When combined with erythromycin, which inhibits CYP3A4, the risk of torsades de pointes is further increased. Among the options provided, Metoclopramide is the most likely medication associated with torsades de pointes in this scenario.",
