  "enhanced_information": "Glucose is the primary energy source for cardiac muscle under normal conditions, with fatty acids serving as a secondary source. Ketone bodies can also be utilized as an energy source for cardiac muscle under certain conditions. The myocardium utilizes energy from glucose in its metabolic processes.",
  "analysis": "Glucose is the primary energy source for cardiac muscle under normal conditions, with fatty acids serving as a secondary source. Ketone bodies can also be utilized as an energy source for cardiac muscle under certain conditions. Given that glucose is the primary source of energy for cardiac muscle at normal conditions, the most likely correct option is glucose.",
