  "enhanced_information": "Cholecystokinin acts by causing the contraction of the gall bladder and the secretion of pancreatic juice rich in enzymes. It does not directly increase the secretion of enterokinase. Therefore, the correct action of cholecystokinin is the contraction of the gall bladder and the secretion of pancreatic juice rich in enzymes, making option b the most accurate.",
  "analysis": "Cholecystokinin primarily acts by causing the contraction of the gall bladder and the secretion of pancreatic juice rich in enzymes. It does not directly increase the secretion of enterokinase. Therefore, the correct action of cholecystokinin is the contraction of the gall bladder and the secretion of pancreatic juice rich in enzymes.",
