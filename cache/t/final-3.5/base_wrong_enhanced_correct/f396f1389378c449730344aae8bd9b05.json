  "enhanced_information": "In a patient with liver disease, maneuvers that may lead to the development of hyperammonemia include the use of loop diuretics, which can cause hypovolemia leading to decreased renal blood flow and impaired ammonia excretion.",
  "analysis": "In a patient with liver disease, hyperammonemia can occur due to impaired ammonia excretion. Loop diuretics can lead to hypovolemia, reducing renal blood flow and exacerbating ammonia accumulation. Protein restriction, neomycin, and a branched-chain amino acid-enriched protein mixture are not directly associated with hyperammonemia in liver disease.",
