  "enhanced_information": "Pilocarpine reduces intraocular pressure in closed-angle glaucoma by contracting the iris sphincter muscle, which leads to an increase in aqueous humor outflow. This mechanism is mediated through the stimulation of muscarinic receptors. Evidence supports the association of pilocarpine with muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, reinforcing its role in treating functional disorders related to these receptors.",
  "analysis": "Pilocarpine reduces intraocular pressure in closed-angle glaucoma by contracting the iris sphincter muscle, leading to an increase in aqueous humor outflow. This mechanism is well-supported by evidence and aligns with the known pharmacological action of pilocarpine on muscarinic receptors.",
