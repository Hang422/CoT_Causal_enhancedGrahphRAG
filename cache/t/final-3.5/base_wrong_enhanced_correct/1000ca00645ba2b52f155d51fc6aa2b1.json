  "enhanced_information": "Shock can lead to different types of hypoxia: Stagnant hypoxia due to decreased tissue perfusion, anemic hypoxia from decreased oxygen delivery to tissues, histotoxic hypoxia due to impaired oxygen utilization at the cellular level, and hypoxic hypoxia from impaired oxygen exchange in the lungs.",
  "analysis": "Shock can lead to different types of hypoxia, but the most common type associated with shock is Stagnant hypoxia due to decreased tissue perfusion. This is because shock often results in inadequate blood flow to tissues, leading to oxygen deprivation. While other types of hypoxia can also occur in shock, Stagnant hypoxia is the most prevalent.",
