  "enhanced_information": "Atropine, a muscarinic receptor blocker, can block bradycardia caused by infusion of acetylcholine. It does not affect increased blood pressure caused by nicotine or increased skeletal muscle strength caused by neostigmine, an acetylcholine esterase inhibitor.",
  "analysis": "Atropine, a muscarinic receptor blocker, primarily blocks the effects of excessive parasympathetic stimulation. It can effectively counteract bradycardia caused by infusion of acetylcholine by inhibiting the action of acetylcholine on muscarinic receptors in the heart. Atropine does not have a direct effect on increased blood pressure caused by nicotine or increased skeletal muscle strength caused by neostigmine, an acetylcholine esterase inhibitor.",
