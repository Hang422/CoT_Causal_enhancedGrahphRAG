  "enhanced_information": "Pulmonary fibrosis is a known complication of Methotrexate, Doxorubicin, Cisplatin, and Busulfan. Methotrexate can lead to pulmonary fibrosis due to its potential complications, Doxorubicin can cause lung tissue damage leading to impaired gas exchange, Cisplatin is associated with fibrotic changes in lung tissue causing respiratory distress, and Busulfan can result in reduced lung compliance. Evidence paths support the relationship between Busulfan and complications, including pulmonary fibrosis.",
  "analysis": "Pulmonary fibrosis is a known complication of Methotrexate, Doxorubicin, Cisplatin, and Busulfan. While all these drugs can lead to pulmonary fibrosis, the enhanced information specifically mentions that Busulfan is associated with complications including pulmonary fibrosis. Therefore, Busulfan is the most likely correct option.",
