This occurs due to factors like high serum calcium levels, hypercalcemia, chronic kidney disease leading to impaired calcium excretion, and prolonged hyperparathyroidism causing increased bone resorption. The evidence paths support the relationship between metastatic calcification and renal tubules, confirming the consensus-aligned reasoning.",
