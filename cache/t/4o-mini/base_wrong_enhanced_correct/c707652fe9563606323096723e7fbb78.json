  "enhanced_information": "Spironolactone is a potassium-sparing diuretic that can lead to increased potassium levels, posing a risk of hyperkalemia. Among the options: Chlorothiazide, a thiazide diuretic, promotes potassium excretion and is not contraindicated. Beta blockers do not significantly affect potassium levels and are also not contraindicated. ACE inhibitors, however, can increase potassium levels and may exacerbate hyperkalemia, making them contraindicated when used with spironolactone. Amlodipine, a calcium channel blocker, does not significantly affect potassium levels and is not contraindicated. Therefore, the drug that is contraindicated along with spironolactone is ACE inhibitors.",
  "analysis": "Spironolactone is a potassium-sparing diuretic that can lead to hyperkalemia, especially when combined with other medications that also increase potassium levels. Among the options provided, Chlorothiazide promotes potassium excretion and is not contraindicated. Beta blockers do not significantly affect potassium levels and are also not contraindicated. Amlodipine, a calcium channel blocker, does not have a significant impact on potassium levels either. However, ACE inhibitors can increase potassium levels and, when used with spironolactone, pose a significant risk of hyperkalemia. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is that ACE inhibitors are contraindicated when used with spironolactone.",
