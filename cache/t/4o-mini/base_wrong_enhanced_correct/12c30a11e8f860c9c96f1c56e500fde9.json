  "enhanced_information": "Glycogen storage diseases are metabolic disorders characterized by enzyme deficiencies that affect glycogen synthesis or breakdown. They include conditions such as Pompe disease and McArdle disease. Krabbe's disease is a lysosomal storage disorder and is not classified as a glycogen storage disease. Similarly, Fabry's disease is a sphingolipidosis, which also does not involve glycogen metabolism. Fragile X syndrome is a genetic condition affecting mental development and is unrelated to glycogen storage. Therefore, all options (Krabbe's disease, Fabry's disease, and Fragile X syndrome) are not classified as glycogen storage diseases.",
  "analysis": "Glycogen storage diseases are specifically related to enzyme deficiencies that affect glycogen metabolism. The options provided include Krabbe's disease, Fabry's disease, and Fragile X syndrome. Krabbe's disease is a lysosomal storage disorder, Fabry's disease is a sphingolipidosis, and Fragile X syndrome is a genetic condition affecting mental development. None of these conditions are classified as glycogen storage diseases. Therefore, all the options listed are correct in that they do not belong to the category of glycogen storage diseases. Thus, the best answer is 'All' as none of the listed diseases are glycogen storage diseases.",
