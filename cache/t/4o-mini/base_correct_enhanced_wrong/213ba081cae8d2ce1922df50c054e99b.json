  "enhanced_information": "Iron absorption primarily occurs in the small intestine, with the duodenum being the main site of absorption. While the jejunum also contributes to iron absorption, the stomach's role is limited to providing an acidic environment necessary for optimal absorption in the duodenum. Therefore, the most accurate option is 'Duodenum + Jejunum' as both sections are involved, but the duodenum is the primary site. This aligns with the consensus that dietary iron absorption is significantly facilitated in the duodenum, supported by the presence of specific transport proteins in this region.",
  "analysis": "Iron absorption primarily occurs in the small intestine, with the duodenum being the main site of absorption. The duodenum is where the acidic environment from the stomach helps solubilize iron, making it more available for absorption. While the jejunum also plays a role in iron absorption, the duodenum is recognized as the primary site. Therefore, the best-supported option is 'Duodenum + Jejunum' since both sections contribute to iron absorption, but the duodenum is the most critical. The stomach does not absorb iron; it only prepares it for absorption in the intestines. Thus, the most accurate answer is 'Duodenum + Jejunum'.",
