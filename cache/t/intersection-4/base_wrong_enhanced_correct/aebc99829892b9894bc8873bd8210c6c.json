Morphine also poses risks from morphine-6-glucuronide accumulation but is less severe compared to Pethidine. Fentanyl and Atracurium are safer in renal failure, with Fentanyl metabolized primarily by the liver and Atracurium undergoing Hofmann elimination, independent of renal function.",
  "analysis": "Pethidine is contra-indicated in renal failure due to the risk of accumulation of its neurotoxic metabolite, norpethidine, which can lead to seizures. This aligns with the core medical principle of avoiding drugs that accumulate harmful metabolites in renal failure. Morphine, while also having risks, is less severe in comparison. Fentanyl and Atracurium are safer alternatives in this context.",
