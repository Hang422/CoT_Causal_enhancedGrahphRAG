  "enhanced_information": "Acute gouty arthritis can occur early in the treatment with allopurinol and probenecid, as both can cause transient increases in uric acid levels due to mobilization from tissue stores or increased excretion, potentially triggering flares. Rasburicase, however, typically results in a rapid decrease in uric acid levels and is less likely to cause such flares. The evidence paths provided do not directly contribute to this specific clinical scenario.",
  "analysis": "Acute gouty arthritis can be triggered early in the treatment with medications like probenecid and allopurinol due to initial increases in uric acid levels. Rasburicase, however, typically reduces uric acid levels quickly and is less likely to cause such flares. The best answer, supported by medical consensus, is that acute gouty arthritis is seen early in treatment following both probenecid and allopurinol.",
