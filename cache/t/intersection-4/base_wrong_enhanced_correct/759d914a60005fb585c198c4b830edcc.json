  "enhanced_information": "I.V. Lignocaine is the preferred treatment for digitalis-induced ventricular arrhythmias due to its ability to stabilize cardiac membranes and reduce excitability without significant QT prolongation. Phenytoin serves as a possible alternative with similar ion channel stabilizing effects. Quinidine and Procainamide, although effective for other arrhythmias, pose risks of QT prolongation and are less suitable for digitalis-induced conditions.",
  "analysis": "I.V. Lignocaine is the drug of choice for digitalis-induced ventricular arrhythmias due to its effective cardiac membrane stabilization and minimal impact on the QT interval, aligning with both standard medical consensus and enhanced information provided.",
