  "enhanced_information": "Calcium is reabsorbed in the DCT, crucial for regulating serum calcium levels, with about 10% reabsorption occurring there. Only about 1-2% of filtered calcium is excreted by the glomerulus, contrary to the 90% excretion claim. PTH indirectly promotes calcium absorption from the intestine by stimulating active vitamin D production. PTH does not directly promote calcitonin action but may trigger its release by increasing blood calcium levels.",
  "analysis": "Calcium reabsorption in the DCT is a well-established physiological process crucial for calcium homeostasis. This option is directly supported by standard medical knowledge, making it the most accurate choice among the provided options.",
