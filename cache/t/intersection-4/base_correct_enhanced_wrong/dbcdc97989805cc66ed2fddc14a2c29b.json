  "enhanced_information": "The protein core of chylomicrons is formed by apolipoproteins. Chylomicrons consist of a core of neutral lipids surrounded by a shell containing phospholipids, cholesterol, and apolipoproteins. Evidence paths confirm interactions between lipids and apoproteins in lipoproteins, supporting the structural role of apolipoproteins in chylomicrons.",
  "analysis": "The core of chylomicrons is primarily made up of triglycerides and cholesterol esters. While option opb does not specify esters, it is the closest to the accurate composition of the chylomicron core, as phospholipids are part of the outer shell, not the core. The decision prioritizes the most accurate representation based on standard medical knowledge.",
