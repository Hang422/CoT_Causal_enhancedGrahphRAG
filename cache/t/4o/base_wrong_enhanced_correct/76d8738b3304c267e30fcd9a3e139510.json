  "enhanced_information": "Free fatty acids are primarily transported in the blood bound to albumin. This is the consensus mechanism for their transport to cells, where they can enter mitochondria for oxidation. The reasoning chain for albumin aligns with this consensus, as albumin is the main carrier of free fatty acids in the bloodstream. The evidence paths mentioning interactions with globulins and chylomicrons are not directly relevant to the transport of free fatty acids to mitochondria, as these proteins are not involved in this specific transport process. Therefore, the correct answer is that free fatty acids are transported by albumin for mitochondrial oxidation.",
  "analysis": "Free fatty acids are transported in the bloodstream primarily bound to albumin. This is a well-established mechanism in biochemistry and physiology. Albumin acts as a carrier protein, facilitating the transport of free fatty acids to various tissues, including muscle and liver, where they can be taken up by cells and transported into mitochondria for beta-oxidation. The other options, such as globulins and chylomicrons, are not involved in the direct transport of free fatty acids to mitochondria. Chylomicrons are involved in the transport of dietary lipids from the intestines, and globulins have different functions, such as immune responses. Therefore, the most likely correct answer, based on standard medical knowledge and consensus, is that free fatty acids are transported by albumin.",
