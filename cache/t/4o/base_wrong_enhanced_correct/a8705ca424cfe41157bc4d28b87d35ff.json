  "enhanced_information": "Cholecystokinin (CCK) is a hormone known to stimulate the contraction of the gallbladder, leading to the release of bile, and to stimulate the pancreas to secrete pancreatic juice rich in digestive enzymes. These actions are well-supported by physiological consensus. The evidence paths confirm CCK's role in gallbladder contraction and pancreatic enzyme secretion, aligning with the consensus. However, the effect of CCK on enterokinase secretion is not well-established or supported by strong evidence, making it less likely to be a primary action of CCK. Therefore, the most accurate actions of CCK are the contraction of the gallbladder and the secretion of enzyme-rich pancreatic juice, supporting options 'a' and 'b'. Option 'd' is incorrect as the effect on enterokinase is uncertain.",
  "analysis": "Cholecystokinin (CCK) is a well-studied hormone with established roles in the digestive system. Its primary actions include stimulating the contraction of the gallbladder, which facilitates the release of bile into the small intestine, and promoting the secretion of pancreatic juice that is rich in digestive enzymes. These actions are widely recognized and supported by physiological consensus. The role of CCK in increasing the secretion of enterokinase is not well-documented or supported by strong evidence, making it unlikely to be a primary action of CCK. Therefore, the most accurate actions of CCK are the contraction of the gallbladder and the secretion of enzyme-rich pancreatic juice, supporting options 'a' and 'b'. Option 'd' is incorrect as the effect on enterokinase is uncertain.",
