However, it does not prevent miosis or respiratory depression caused by opioids. The correct answer is that naltrexone does not block respiratory depression.",
  "analysis": "Naltrexone, as an opioid antagonist, blocks the euphoric effects and reduces cravings by antagonizing opioid receptors. It also prevents respiratory depression by blocking opioid action on these receptors. However, it does not affect miosis, which is mediated through different mechanisms not directly influenced by naltrexone.",
