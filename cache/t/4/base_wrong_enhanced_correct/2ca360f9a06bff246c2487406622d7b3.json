  "enhanced_information": "Metastatic calcification primarily occurs in tissues like the lungs and renal tubules, which are directly involved in blood filtration and mineral metabolism. The lungs are affected due to their role in gas exchange and potential pH changes, while renal tubules are involved due to their regulation of calcium and phosphate, especially under conditions of renal impairment. Cornea and extensor tendons are less commonly affected, with the cornea's specialized structure and the tendons' minimal direct interaction with calcium regulation making them less likely sites for calcification.",
  "analysis": "Renal tubules are directly involved in the regulation of calcium and phosphate, essential factors in the development of metastatic calcification. This makes them a more likely site for such calcifications compared to lungs, cornea, and extensor tendons.",
