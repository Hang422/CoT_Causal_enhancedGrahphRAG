  "enhanced_information": "The stomach secretes gastric lipase, pepsinogens, and hydrochloric acid (HCl). Gastric lipase aids in fat digestion, particularly in infants. Pepsinogens are precursors to pepsin, crucial for protein breakdown. HCl creates an acidic environment essential for digestion and pathogen defense. Therefore, all listed substances are secreted by the stomach, making the option 'None' incorrect as it implies none of the substances are secreted by the stomach.",
  "analysis": "The stomach is known to secrete several substances that aid in digestion. These include gastric lipase, which helps in the digestion of fats; pepsinogens, which are precursors to pepsin and are crucial for protein digestion; and hydrochloric acid (HCl), which creates an acidic environment necessary for the activation of digestive enzymes and for protecting against pathogens. All these substances are indeed secreted by the stomach. Therefore, when evaluating the options provided: opa (Lipase), opb (Pepsinogens), and opc (HCI) are all substances secreted by the stomach. The option opd (None) suggests that none of these substances are secreted by the stomach, which is incorrect based on standard medical knowledge. Thus, the correct answer is that all listed substances are secreted by the stomach, making option opd (None) the answer to the question of which is not secreted by the stomach, as it incorrectly implies that none of the substances are secreted.",
