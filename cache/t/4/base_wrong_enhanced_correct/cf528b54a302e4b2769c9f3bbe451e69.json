  "enhanced_information": "In Diabetes insipidus, characterized by a deficiency or resistance to antidiuretic hormone, the kidneys produce very dilute urine. Urine osmolality typically falls below 150 mmol/L in severe cases, reflecting the significant impairment in the kidney's ability to concentrate urine. This value is consistent with the extreme dilution observed in such conditions.",
  "analysis": "Diabetes insipidus is characterized by the inability of the kidneys to concentrate urine due to a deficiency of or resistance to antidiuretic hormone (ADH). This results in the production of large volumes of dilute urine. Medical consensus indicates that in cases of diabetes insipidus, urine osmolality is typically very low, often falling below 300 mmol/L. The enhanced information provided supports this by stating that urine osmolality can drop below 150 mmol/L in severe cases, which aligns with the known pathophysiology of the condition. Given this information, the most accurate answer is that urine osmolality in diabetes insipidus is less than 150 mmol/L, as this option reflects the extreme dilution of urine observed in such patients.",
