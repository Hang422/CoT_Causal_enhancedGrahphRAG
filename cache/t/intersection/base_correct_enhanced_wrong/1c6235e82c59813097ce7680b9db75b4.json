  "enhanced_information": "In patients on lithium therapy, certain antihypertensive medications can affect lithium levels and increase the risk of toxicity. Clonidine is known to potentially increase lithium levels, making it contraindicated in these patients. Beta blockers do not significantly affect lithium levels and are considered safe. Calcium channel blockers are also generally safe as they do not impact lithium levels. However, diuretics can affect lithium clearance and may lead to increased lithium levels, thus they are also contraindicated. Therefore, both Clonidine and diuretics should be avoided in patients on lithium therapy to prevent toxicity.",
  "analysis": "In patients undergoing lithium therapy, it is crucial to monitor and manage potential drug interactions that could lead to increased lithium levels and toxicity. Among the options provided, clonidine is known to potentially increase lithium levels, making it contraindicated. Diuretics can also affect lithium clearance, leading to increased levels and toxicity, thus they are also contraindicated. Beta blockers and calcium channel blockers do not significantly impact lithium levels and are generally considered safe. Therefore, both clonidine and diuretics are contraindicated, but since the question asks for one specific antihypertensive drug that is contraindicated, the best answer is clonidine due to its direct effect on increasing lithium levels. This aligns with the consensus in pharmacology regarding the management of patients on lithium therapy.",
