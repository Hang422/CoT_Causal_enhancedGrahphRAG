  "enhanced_information": "Chloroquine is primarily used for malaria treatment and is not commonly associated with myopathy, making it the best option among those listed. Betamethasone, a corticosteroid, is known to potentially cause muscle weakness and is associated with myopathy. Chloramphenicol, while an antibiotic, has a rare association with myopathy, making it possible but not common. Zidovudine, used for HIV treatment, has a high association with muscle damage and is known to cause myopathy. Therefore, the drug that does not cause myopathy is Chloroquine.",
  "analysis": "Chloroquine is primarily used for the treatment of malaria and is not commonly associated with myopathy, making it a strong candidate for the option that does not cause myopathy. Betamethasone, a corticosteroid, can lead to muscle weakness and is known to be associated with myopathy. Chloramphenicol, while primarily an antibiotic, has rare reports of myopathy, and Zidovudine is well-documented to cause muscle damage and myopathy in patients. Given this information, Chloroquine stands out as the drug least likely to cause myopathy among the options provided.",
