  "enhanced_information": "In evaluating the antitubercular drugs for use in severe renal failure: \n\n1. **Streptomycin**: It is primarily excreted by the kidneys, leading to potential accumulation and toxicity in severe renal failure. Therefore, it is not safe to use in this condition. \n\n2. **Ethambutol**: This drug is partially excreted by the kidneys, and while dose adjustment is required in renal failure, it can be used with caution. This aligns with the consensus that it is safer than streptomycin in patients with renal impairment. \n\n3. **Capreomycin**: Similar to streptomycin, capreomycin is excreted by the kidneys and poses a risk of nephrotoxicity, making it not recommended in severe renal failure. \n\n4. **Rifampicin**: This drug is primarily metabolized by the liver with minimal renal excretion, making it generally safe for use in patients with renal failure. \n\nThus, the best options for use in severe renal failure are Ethambutol (with caution) and Rifampicin (generally safe).",
  "analysis": "In evaluating the antitubercular drugs for use in patients with severe renal failure, we consider the pharmacokinetics and safety profiles of each drug. Streptomycin and capreomycin are both primarily excreted by the kidneys, which increases the risk of accumulation and toxicity in patients with renal impairment, making them unsafe options. Ethambutol is partially excreted by the kidneys and requires dose adjustment, but it can be used with caution in renal failure. Rifampicin, on the other hand, is mainly metabolized by the liver and has minimal renal excretion, making it generally safe for use in patients with severe renal failure. Therefore, the best-supported option for use in severe renal failure is Rifampicin, as it poses the least risk of toxicity compared to the other options.",
