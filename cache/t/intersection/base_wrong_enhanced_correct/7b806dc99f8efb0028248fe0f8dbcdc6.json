  "enhanced_information": "At physiological pH (around 7.4), amino acids can exist in different charged states. Histidine has a pKa close to this pH, allowing it to exist in both protonated and deprotonated forms, which contributes to its stability in biological systems. This property makes histidine often considered stable at physiological pH. Lysine and arginine are both positively charged at this pH, but their higher pKa values indicate they are more stable in their protonated forms rather than being the most stable overall. Glycine, while stable, does not exhibit the unique properties of charged amino acids. Therefore, histidine is the most stable amino acid at physiological pH due to its ability to exist in multiple forms. The evidence paths related to histidine's interactions with cells and immune functions further support its biological significance.",
  "analysis": "At physiological pH (around 7.4), amino acids can exist in different charged states, which affects their stability. Histidine has a pKa value close to physiological pH, allowing it to exist in both protonated and deprotonated forms, which contributes to its stability in biological systems. This unique property makes histidine particularly versatile and stable in various biological contexts. In contrast, lysine and arginine are positively charged at this pH, but their higher pKa values suggest they are more stable in their protonated forms rather than being the most stable overall. Glycine, while stable, does not exhibit the same properties as charged amino acids. Therefore, based on the consensus that histidine's ability to exist in multiple forms at physiological pH contributes to its stability, histidine is the most stable amino acid at this pH. The enhanced information supports this conclusion, emphasizing histidine's biological significance and stability. Thus, the best-supported option is histidine.",
