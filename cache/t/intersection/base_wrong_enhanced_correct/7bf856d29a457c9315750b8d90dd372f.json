  "enhanced_information": "Loxatidine is an H2 receptor antagonist that reduces gastric acid secretion but does not meet the criteria as it blocks H2 receptors. Pirenzepine selectively blocks M1 muscarinic receptors, which does not align with the requirement since it does not block H2 receptors. Omeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor that effectively blocks both basal and stimulated gastric acid secretion without affecting cholinergic, histaminergic, or gastrin receptors, making it the best option. Famotidine, like Loxatidine, is an H2 receptor antagonist and does not meet the criteria. Therefore, the correct choice is Omeprazole, as it aligns with the requirement to block gastric acid secretion without affecting the specified receptors.",
  "analysis": "The question asks for a drug that blocks both basal and stimulated gastric acid secretion without affecting cholinergic, histaminergic, or gastrin receptors. Omeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) that works by irreversibly inhibiting the H+/K+ ATPase in the gastric parietal cells, effectively reducing gastric acid secretion regardless of the stimulus. This mechanism does not involve the cholinergic, histaminergic, or gastrin pathways, making it the most suitable choice. In contrast, Loxatidine and Famotidine are H2 receptor antagonists, which block histamine receptors and therefore do not meet the criteria. Pirenzepine selectively blocks M1 muscarinic receptors, which also does not align with the requirement. Therefore, Omeprazole is the best-supported option based on the provided criteria.",
