  "enhanced_information": "Dopamine acts on D2 receptors to inhibit prolactin secretion. When D2 receptors are blocked, this inhibition is reduced, leading to increased prolactin levels. This increase in prolactin is associated with excessive lactation (galactorrhea) and can also contribute to gonadal dysfunction due to hormonal imbalances. Headaches may occur as a secondary effect of elevated prolactin levels. However, increased prolactin does not cause visual disturbances, which are not directly linked to prolactin levels. Therefore, the effect that will not be seen when D2 receptors are blocked is visual disturbance.",
  "analysis": "Dopamine normally inhibits prolactin secretion through D2 receptors. When these receptors are blocked, prolactin levels increase, leading to several potential effects. Excessive lactation (galactorrhea) is a direct consequence of elevated prolactin levels, making it an expected effect when D2 receptors are blocked. Gonadal dysfunction can also occur due to hormonal imbalances caused by high prolactin levels. Headaches may arise as a secondary effect of increased prolactin. However, visual disturbances are not directly linked to prolactin levels and are not a recognized effect of increased prolactin. Therefore, the effect that will not be seen when D2 receptors are blocked is visual disturbance. This aligns with the enhanced information provided, which supports the conclusion that visual disturbances are not a consequence of elevated prolactin levels. Thus, the most likely correct answer is that visual disturbance will not be seen.",
