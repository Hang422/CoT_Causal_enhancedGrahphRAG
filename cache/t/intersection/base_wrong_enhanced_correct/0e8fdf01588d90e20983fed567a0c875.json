  "enhanced_information": "In humans, depolarization of cardiac ventricular muscle primarily starts at the left side of the interventricular septum. This is supported by the electrical conduction system of the heart, where the left bundle branch depolarizes first, leading to the initiation of ventricular depolarization. The depolarization spreads through the ventricular myocardium, including the Purkinje fibers, which facilitate rapid conduction. Therefore, the most accurate option is 'opb. Left side of inter ventricular septum.'",
  "analysis": "In the human heart, the depolarization of the cardiac ventricular muscle begins at the left side of the interventricular septum. This is due to the structure of the heart's conduction system, where the left bundle branch, which is part of the conduction pathway, depolarizes first. This initiates the overall process of ventricular depolarization, which then spreads throughout the ventricular myocardium. The enhanced information aligns with this understanding, confirming that the left side of the interventricular septum is indeed the starting point for depolarization. Therefore, the most accurate option is 'opb. Left side of inter ventricular septum.'",
