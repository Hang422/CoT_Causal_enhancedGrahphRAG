  "enhanced_information": "Renin is produced by juxtaglomerular cells in the kidneys and is involved in blood pressure regulation, confirming its renal origin. Angiotensin I is produced from angiotensinogen, which is synthesized in the liver, and while it is converted in the lungs, it is not directly produced by the renal system. Erythropoietin is indeed produced by interstitial cells in the kidneys and stimulates red blood cell production, confirming its renal origin. 1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25DHCC) is the active form of vitamin D, produced in the kidneys from calcidiol, confirming its renal origin. Therefore, the peptide not produced by the renal system is Angiotensin I.",
  "analysis": "To determine which peptide is not produced by the renal system, we analyze each option: Renin is produced by juxtaglomerular cells in the kidneys, confirming its renal origin. Erythropoietin is also produced by the kidneys, specifically by interstitial cells, and plays a role in stimulating red blood cell production. 1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25DHCC) is the active form of vitamin D, which is produced in the kidneys from calcidiol. In contrast, Angiotensin I is not produced by the kidneys; it is formed from angiotensinogen, which is synthesized in the liver. Therefore, the peptide that is not produced by the renal system is Angiotensin I. This conclusion aligns with the enhanced information provided, which confirms the renal origins of the other peptides. Thus, the best-supported option is Angiotensin I.",
