  "enhanced_information": "Aldosterone is recognized as the most potent mineralocorticoid, primarily regulating sodium and potassium balance in the body. Deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA) is a mineralocorticoid but is less potent than aldosterone in terms of sodium retention. Fludrocortisone is a synthetic mineralocorticoid that is more potent than cortisol but still less potent than aldosterone. Triamcinolone, on the other hand, is classified as a glucocorticoid and does not possess mineralocorticoid activity. Therefore, the consensus supports that aldosterone is the most potent mineralocorticoid.",
  "analysis": "Aldosterone is widely recognized as the most potent mineralocorticoid, primarily responsible for regulating sodium and potassium balance in the body. Deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA) is a mineralocorticoid but is less potent than aldosterone. Fludrocortisone, while a synthetic mineralocorticoid, is also less potent than aldosterone. Triamcinolone is a glucocorticoid and does not have mineralocorticoid activity. Therefore, based on established pharmacological principles and consensus, aldosterone is the most potent mineralocorticoid.",
