  "enhanced_information": "Arachidonic acid is an unsaturated fatty acid that can increase membrane fluidity due to its kinked structure, which disrupts tight packing of phospholipids, enhancing cell signaling. Cholesterol, while important for maintaining membrane integrity, actually decreases fluidity at high concentrations by filling spaces between phospholipids, thus it does not increase fluidity. Both palmitic acid and stearic acid are saturated fatty acids, which increase membrane rigidity and decrease fluidity. Therefore, the correct answer is 'Arachidonic acid' as it is the only option that increases plasma membrane fluidity.",
  "analysis": "The fluidity of the plasma membrane is influenced by the types of fatty acids present in the phospholipid bilayer. Arachidonic acid is an unsaturated fatty acid, which introduces kinks in the fatty acid chains, preventing tight packing and thereby increasing membrane fluidity. In contrast, cholesterol generally stabilizes the membrane and can decrease fluidity at high concentrations. Palmitic acid and stearic acid are both saturated fatty acids, which tend to pack tightly together, leading to increased rigidity and decreased fluidity. Therefore, the most supported option that increases plasma membrane fluidity is 'Arachidonic acid'.",
