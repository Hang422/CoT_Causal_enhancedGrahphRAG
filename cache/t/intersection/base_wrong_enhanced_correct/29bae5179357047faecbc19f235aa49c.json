  "enhanced_information": "Ketone bodies are produced primarily in the liver during periods of fasting or low carbohydrate intake and serve as an alternative energy source for various tissues. Skeletal muscles and cardiac muscles can utilize ketone bodies for energy, especially during prolonged exercise or fasting. However, the liver does not utilize ketone bodies; instead, it produces them. Red blood cells (RBCs) lack mitochondria and therefore cannot utilize ketone bodies. Thus, the organs that do not utilize ketone bodies are the liver and RBCs.",
  "analysis": "Ketone bodies are primarily produced in the liver and serve as an alternative energy source for various tissues during fasting or low carbohydrate intake. Skeletal muscles and cardiac muscles can utilize ketone bodies for energy, particularly during prolonged exercise or fasting. However, the liver does not utilize ketone bodies; it is responsible for their production. Red blood cells (RBCs) lack mitochondria and therefore cannot utilize ketone bodies either. Given the options, the liver (opc) and RBCs (opd) do not utilize ketone bodies, but since the question asks for organs that do not utilize them, the most straightforward answer is RBCs, as they are a distinct organ type that is universally recognized as incapable of utilizing ketone bodies. Therefore, the best-supported option is RBCs (opd).",
