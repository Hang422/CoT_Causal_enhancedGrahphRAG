  "enhanced_information": "The activation of Purkinje fibers leads to the stimulation of the ventricular myocardium, initiating contraction that begins at the apex of the heart. This contraction spreads upwards towards the base, meaning the endocardium is activated before the epicardium. The correct order of activation is therefore Septum → Endocardium → Epicardium. This aligns with the consensus that the septum is activated first, followed by the endocardium, and finally the epicardium, confirming that option 'opa' is the correct answer.",
  "analysis": "The activation of the heart's ventricles begins with the Purkinje fibers, which are specialized conducting fibers that distribute the electrical impulse throughout the ventricular myocardium. The sequence of activation is crucial for effective contraction. The consensus in cardiac physiology indicates that the impulse travels from the septum, activating the endocardium first, and then spreading to the epicardium. This is due to the anatomical arrangement of the heart's conduction system and the way the electrical impulse propagates. Therefore, the correct order of activation after stimulation of Purkinje fibers is Septum → Endocardium → Epicardium, which corresponds to option 'opa'.",
