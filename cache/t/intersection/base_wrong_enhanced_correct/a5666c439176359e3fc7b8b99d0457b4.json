  "enhanced_information": "Aldosterone primarily acts on the renal tubules, specifically increasing sodium reabsorption and potassium excretion. The most significant sites of action are the distal tubules and the collecting duct. Aldosterone stimulates sodium channels, enhancing water retention and influencing blood pressure regulation. Evidence supports that aldosterone's effects are most pronounced in the distal tubules and collecting duct, confirming its role in electrolyte balance and excretory function.",
  "analysis": "Aldosterone is a steroid hormone produced by the adrenal cortex that plays a crucial role in regulating sodium and potassium levels in the body. Its primary action is on the renal tubules, specifically enhancing sodium reabsorption and promoting potassium excretion. The enhanced information indicates that the most significant sites of action for aldosterone are the distal tubules and the collecting duct. While the proximal tubule and Loop of Henle are involved in renal function, they are not the primary sites for aldosterone action. Given the consensus in the medical literature, the best-supported option is the distal tubules and the collecting duct, with a stronger emphasis on the collecting duct as the primary site of action. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is the collecting duct.",
